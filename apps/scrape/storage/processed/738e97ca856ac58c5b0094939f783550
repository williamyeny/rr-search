For a 1 quart jar, use 1 1/4 cup rye grass seed, and 5/8 cup water.  Add a pinch of gypsum between your thumb and forefinger per jar.   Put a solid lid on the jar and shake well.  Allow to sit for an hour or two, then shake again. Replace the solid lid with a filtered lid, and PC for an hour at 15 psi.<br /><br />Rye grass seed makes an excellent grain master, because you can easily do a grain to grain transfer into 20 jars.   I won't go over ten jars with rye berries.  It's also a great spawn to bulk substrates, because of all the inoculation points.   It also seems less susceptable to trichoderma then the larger rye berris.  We usually don't recommend it to new growers because it often takes quite a few tries to get the moisture right.   If it's too wet, the mycelium can't colonize.  Ditto if it's too dry.  The above plan should work out for you though.<br />RR","title":"Re: RYE GRASS SEED?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
