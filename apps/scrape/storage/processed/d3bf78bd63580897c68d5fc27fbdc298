The jars with the fine filter layer but coarse base layer have pretty much kept up with the coarse jars. The jars that are all fine verm are doing okay, but seem to be a little behind. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Fine verm works better.&nbsp; You should <i>always</i> use fine verm for the filter as course verm will let contaminants sail right through.<br /><br />Using fine vermiculite, more of it fits into a given sized jar, meaning more substrate.&nbsp; It may take slightly longer to colonize, but that's because there's more of it.<br />RR","title":"Re: WW3 PF Tek style - My grow log"}}
