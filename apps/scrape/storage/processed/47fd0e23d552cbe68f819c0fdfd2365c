There is always going to be a few contaminant spores on every print. There's no way to avoid them unless we grew on sterilized substrates in a hyperbaric chamber.<br /><br />By using the whole syringe, you also used all the contaminants that were on the print along with the mushroom spores.  Since molds germinate and grow faster than mushroom mycelium, this gives contamination the upper hand.   <br /><br />A print should make up to ten or even more syringes, depending on size and darkness of the print.  <br /><br />In addition, too many mushroom spores is also counterproductive.  Eventually, all those strains that are created need to merge by anastomosis into a common whole for fruiting.  Since some strains are not compatible with each other, by using an excess of spores, your substrate will have several small zones of different strains, thus none of them will have the benefit of the entire cake.  This results in smaller fruits, or sometimes no fruits at all.<br /><br />I'd suggest diluting that with sterile, distilled water into at least five more syringes before use.  The alternative is to use far less per jar, but it's hard to squeeze out less than .5 ml.<br />RR","title":"Re: How is this for a first time spore syringe?"}}
