Trichoderma is a fact of life and can totally wipe out a grow area in seven to ten days if you just leave it there.  If one tray becomes contaminated and not removed within hours, all trays are green within four or five days.  Better teach her to recognize contaminants and give her 'permission' to toss out any tray that has them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ultrasonic or Cool Mist?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
