I'd suggest two hours if you're running at less pressure.<br /><br />The way to use your pc is to turn the stove on high and allow it to begin venting steam once it warms up.  Keep the weight off for the first five minutes steam is escaping in order to get the interior and jars up to temperature.  Then, put the weight on and allow it to come to pressure.   Once pressure is reached, turn the stove down to the minimum setting that will maintain pressure with a minimum of rattling of the weight.  Most PC's will vent a small amount of steam just before the weight actually rattles.  If you can find that spot, you can run for several hours without using much water.  When the weight rattles constantly, you'll lose your water in a short time.<br /><br />Be sure to put something on the bottom to protect your jars from the heat of the stove  burner.<br />RR","title":"Re: PC - Help! please read","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
