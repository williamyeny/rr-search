I checked their site and found it disturbing and misinformed.  They're not a sponsor here, and seem to be more interested in selling weed growing stuff than mushrooms, despite the name.  I'd avoid them.<br /><br />Either way, this forum is for cultivation related questions only, and the sponsors forum is restricted to our sponsors.  I hope you didn't get screwed.  If you paid by credit card, you can call your card company and cancel the charge if necessary.<br /><br />Deal with our sponsors in the future and you'll be sure to get your stuff.  We've pulled the plug on several recently for giving bad service, so you know you're safe with them.  Good luck to you.<br /><br />Click.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help!!!!!"}}
