They played with rattlers as babies, so they can understand that sound. In other words, walmart has to dumb down the instructions.&nbsp; Not only that, the unit was designed for canning.&nbsp; We're 'misusing' it as a sterilizing tool.<br /><br />Turn the stove down so there's no rocking once pressure is reached and the weight has jiggled a few times.&nbsp; If this means it runs at 14 psi to keep things quiet, so be it.&nbsp; Usually a small hiss will escape before the weight actually rattles.&nbsp; If you can find this sweet spot, great.&nbsp; Otherwise, just run at 13 to 14 psi.&nbsp; This prevents your jars from drying out or your agar from boiling over.<br /><br />Don't forget to let the PC vent steam for five to ten minutes at the start of the cycle before you close the valve or place the weight in place.&nbsp; This is important to bleed all the air out of the unit and replace it with steam.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pc question about perfect setting","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
