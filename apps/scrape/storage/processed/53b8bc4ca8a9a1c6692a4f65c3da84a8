Condensation on the sides is an indication that it is warmer inside the box than outside the box.  Condensation is not related to humidity.  This is a common misunderstanding.<br /><br />For maximum humidity, rinse the perlite in a strainer under the faucet, then when it has drained well, dump it into your terrarium.   A 2\" layer of damp, but not wet perlite will give you 99% humidity for at least three weeks, which is the average duration of a flush anyway.  Rinse and reload the perlite when you dunk the cakes between flushes.<br /><br />As said above, pinning can take up to a couple of weeks.  Give them fluorescent lights on a 12/12 schedule and you'll see pins soon.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why no pinning?"}}
