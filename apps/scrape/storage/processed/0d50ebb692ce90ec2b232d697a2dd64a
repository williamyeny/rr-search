Perhaps two or three pounds.  Yes, I built a place for it to hang.  To open it, I simply roll up the PVC and 'door' from the bottom.  It makes a nice little roll to hang on the hooks at the top.  My entire greenhouse is framed with PVC pipe and covered with plastic sheeting.  <br />I also have a self contained air conditioning system to use when fruiting cold weather loving mushrooms such as oyster and shiitake.  I can keep the greenhouse at 58F, while the room outside is 70F.<br />RR","title":"Re: greenhouse temperatures"}}
