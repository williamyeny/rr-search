It's recommended to mist mushrooms.  Air exchange must be provided because stagnant water sitting on a mushroom in stagnant air for an extended period WILL cause aborts.<br /><br />Condensation does not begin on all surfaces at about 95%. My can of cold beer gets condensation in Arizona in the summer.  I know it's not 95% there. Condensation forms on my windows in winter, even when humidity in the house is less than 50%. Condensation is a function of the temperature differential on either side of a surface. Condensation forms on the warm side. Condensation won't even form on your mushrooms at 100% humidity.  If they get wet, it's because liquid water droplets were thrown on them, not humidity in the air.<br /><br />92% humidity will be fine with a good casing layer.  I prefer higher, but lower will also still work, only requiring more frequent misting.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Myth of 100% Humidity"}}
