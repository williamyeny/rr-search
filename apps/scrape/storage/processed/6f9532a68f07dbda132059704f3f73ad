My point was that stagnant water will not cause aborts, but directly misting will cause aborts.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That is flat out wrong.&nbsp; Directly misting will not cause aborts.&nbsp; <br /><br />You MUST mist to replace lost moisture or you'll have a very crappy pinset and harvest.&nbsp; Evaporation of moisture from a substrate is the number one pinning trigger.&nbsp; That's why we give lots of fresh air.&nbsp; However, this lost moisture must be replaced or the substrate and fruits dry out.<br /><br />Mushrooms can absorb nearly as much water from the air or on their surface as they do from the substrate.&nbsp; When you mist, make sure the fruits have no standing water on them half an hour later.&nbsp; If they do, it means you need more fresh air supply.<br /><br />Stagnant water on mushrooms will abort them.&nbsp; In fact, clean water on mushrooms in a sealed terrarium will cause aborts, and that's why nobody uses them any more.&nbsp; Dunking/soaking properly will not cause aborts.&nbsp; Every shiitake farm in the world soaks substrates before first flush and again after each flush.&nbsp; This is how it's done.<br />RR","title":"Re: The conflict of misting..."}}
