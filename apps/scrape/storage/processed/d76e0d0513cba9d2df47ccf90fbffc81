Over 90% of the contaminants in a room are within a foot or two of the floor.<br /><br />I said 'direct' sunlight is bad.  Diffused is not, nor is fluorescent.  My jars are exposed to fluorescent office type lighting for up to 18 hours a day, and longer if I'm working late.  It has no effect on colonizing mycelium.<br /><br />Closets are also horrible places to put fruiting chambers.  Leave the door open to ensure fresh air, as it can get stale fast in a closed up closet and contaminants thrive in still, stale, damp air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Quick question for the guru, RR..."}}
