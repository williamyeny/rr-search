Mycelium does not urinate, period.<br /><br />Metabolytes can be secreted whether the mycelium is under stress or not.  I've often seen quite large puddles of metabolytes forming on the top of manure based substrates during initial colonization. These substrates were not exposed to excess temps, co2, or a long incubation period. I've also seen and photographed metabolytes forming on a petri dish being colonized in completely sterile conditions.  Mycologists agree that the metabolytes have a protective function and that they're antimicrobial.  Some production of metabolyte is going to occur no matter what.  Perhaps the mycelium is producing them for the future, sort of like us buying insurance before we have an accident.<br /><br />Most of the antibiotics we use for medicine are produced from mycelium metabolytes.  I know of no common medicine produced from urine.   Using such terms as 'piss' only shows vulgarity and ignorance of mycology.  Let's clean it up please.<br />RR","title":"Re: CONTAM OR PISS (PICTURE)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
