The lid itself isn't threaded with two-piece lid mason jars.  You don't want the rye grains to come into contact with the filter disk.  Be sure to put the metal lid on first with two 1/8\" holes(1mm), then put the filter disk above that, then the metal ring goes on last.  This way, when you shake the jars, the grain doesn't get the filter wet with grain juice.  A wet filter is a vector for contaminants because they can colonize right through the interior of the filter.  Be sure to keep your filter disks dry for best results.<br /><br />Also, don't forget you can reuse the filter disks forever.  I have some that are stained red and brown from grains, manure and the rust on the lids and probably have a few hundred uses, but still work as good as new. I don't attempt to clean them.  Simply remove from one jar and store in a dry place until ready to use on the next jar.  The PC will take care of anything nasty on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: mycosupply sythetic filter discs","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
