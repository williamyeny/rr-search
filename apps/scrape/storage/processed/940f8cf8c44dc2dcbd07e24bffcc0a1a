The mycelium will produce a few degrees on its own, so if a pf jar you can go as high as 81.  If a grain jar, go as high as 78F, and if a large filter patch spawn bag, don't go much over 75F for best results.  There's a lot of disinformation floating around out there, so you have to learn to wade through the bs. Post a picture of that jar in a few days, but I don't like the looks of that mycelium.<br />RR<br />RR","title":"Re: Some yellowish spot in my jar","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
