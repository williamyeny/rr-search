New growers spend way too much time worrying about fruiting chambers, sterilizing the perlite, adding peroxide, filtering the air, etc., when none of that helps one whit. The place in my house that works best for placing terrariums is right by a big sliding glass door, and the entire frame and sheetrock paper all around it are completely covered in black mold.  My terrariums sit less than 18\" from sporulating black mold, yet it NEVER infects the cakes.  Why?  They were created in sterile conditions and allowed to colonize fully plus one week before birthing.<br /><br />While folks are stressing out over being sterile where 'clean' is good enough, they do what <i>should</i> be done in a glovebox in an open bathroom or kitchen instead.  Those are the two filthiest rooms in any house, teeming with e-coli and other fecal bacteria as well as penicillium and other molds from fruit, and nothing sterile should ever be in them.  In short, the most research should go into proper sterile <i>spawn generation</i> techniques, and the second priority should be a good pinning strategy.<br />RR","title":"Re: general survey to all the growers out there....most difficult aspect of growing?"}}
