When you mist your cakes or other substrate, the excess mist falls on the perlite, keeping it hydrated as well.<br /><br />You want to be losing moisture from your substrate.&nbsp; You also want to be putting moisture back in.&nbsp; The ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&nbsp; Anything you do to cut down on fresh air supply will make things worse not better.&nbsp; I've colonized substrates in the mid 70s and fruited in the mid 90s without any problems at all.&nbsp; Just remember to mist as required.<br />RR","title":"Re: Newbie casing questions concerning humidity and popcorn","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
