Long, fat stems with tiny caps are the giveaway.  2\" between 1/4\" holes is about right.  They should be on all six sides, with four to five inches of well drained perlite for highest humidity and best results.<br /><br />If you live in an extremely low humidity environment, simply run a coolmist humidifier in the room you locate your terrarium to raise ambient to 50% or above.<br />RR","title":"Re: FC Comparison (pics)"}}
