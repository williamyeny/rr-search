The other problem with store bought cow manure is it has a lot of urea in it because it comes from crowded feed lots and the cows urinate as much as they deficate and it all gets scooped up together.  Be sure when you open the bag of cow manure, if it smells like ammonia, spread it out on the back porch in the sun for a day or two and the ammonia will flash off, leaving it ok to use.  <br /><br />Of course horse manure is better and can be used by itself, but if you add those other ingredients, the cow will work ok.  Just don't use the cow manure by itself, or as said above you'll be disappointed.  You can also use straw, ground corn cobs(minus the kernels), cotton seed hulls, dried weeds and/or grass clippings from your back yard, etc., to break up the manure.  Just use whatever is easy to find in your location. In many areas, you can get bagged compost at nurseries to mix in as well. Coir or worm castings are not necessary if you have a few of the other things listed.  Just make a cocktail out of whatever you can find and go to work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Store bought manure mixed with coffee grinds, verm and lime","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
