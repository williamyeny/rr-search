Remember to run the flow hood for at least half an hour before starting work so it can scrub the air in your closed up room.<br /><br />Wash the inoculating loop with alcohol, then flame the tip until it's red hot.  This will only take a second or two because it's such a fine gage wire.  Cool the loop for a second or two in front of the flow hood, then dip into the receiving dish of agar to finish cooling.  This also puts a small amount of agar on the loop which helps spores to stick to it.<br /><br />Unwrap the print with gloved hands in front of your hood.  With your now cooled loop, rub a very small area on the print, then touch the loop to your agar and you'll see the spores as they transfer from the loop to the agar.  Just spread them around the surface, don't try to push them in.  Try to keep the spores close to the same area so they can exchange genetic information and differentiate into strains/sectors soon after germination.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help with work from print to agar","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
