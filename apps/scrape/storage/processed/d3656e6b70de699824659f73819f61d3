It also does no good to spray with lysol either.  The problem is still, stale air.  Fruiting chambers need to be in an open room with good air circulation.  Any small, closed off space is not going to be a good place for an FC.<br /><br />If you have a totally empty closet, with no clothing or other stuff inside, you could probably be successful if you'd cut an opening in the door and install a fan.  Perhaps an intake and exhaust fan in the door would do the trick, but I'd suggest moving the terrarium into an open, well ventilated room.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterile as can be with closet grow...can't keep contams away."}}
