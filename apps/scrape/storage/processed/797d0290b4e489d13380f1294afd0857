The top layer of straw rarely colonizes unless you compress it with something.  You could actually put on some gloves and mash that down so the top straw is flat against the rest and it will recover within a day or two.<br /><br />With manure/compost based substrates, it's safe to apply the casing layer at anywhere from 90% to 100% colonization because the manure will finish colonizing as the casing layer is being run with mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing before 100% colonization"}}
