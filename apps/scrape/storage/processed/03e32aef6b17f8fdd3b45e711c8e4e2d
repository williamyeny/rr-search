Flipping your jars over won't do anything.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Not quite.&nbsp; Gravity is the whole issue.&nbsp; It's why pint jars perform poorly also.&nbsp; The substrate packs and then air can't circulate to force the CO2 gasses out, leading to stalling.&nbsp; That's why short, fat jars work best.<br /><br />Turning a stalled jar upside down will often help it to finish colonizing.&nbsp; Not only does it help the CO2 to escape, but the packed substrate will drop somewhat, opening an air space at the bottom(now top) of the jar.&nbsp; The danger is when you turn a jar over, you disturb the verm layer, so if you do, leave it upside down until finished.&nbsp; Don't go back and forth with it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Gravity compacting BRF and verm","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
