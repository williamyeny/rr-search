For the former, get a stereo microscope, and the latter you'll want a light microscope.  Both open up a whole new world of mycology that few get to see and will make a geek out of you in a hurry.<br /><br />Scroll through my gallery and you'll find a couple of dozen microscope pictures taken with a variety of scopes and cameras. If you see what you want to look at, let me know and I'll show ya which microscope/camera combination was used. I have six microscopes and use every single one of them, depending on purpose.  Two are cheap versions of my bigger ones and they're in your price range.  I use them first because they're light and easy to move around.  If I need a wider field of view or clearer view, or want to take a high quality picture, I move to the big boys.<br />RR","title":"Re: microscopes","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
