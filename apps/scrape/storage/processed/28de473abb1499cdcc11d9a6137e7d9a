I mostly mention unpasteurized coir when someone is trying to find the cause of their green mold.&nbsp; Generally, it's due to contaminated spawn, since fungi spores have a very hard time germinating on coir for reasons that remain unknown.<br />RR","title":"Re: My coco coir looks like woodchips... and I don't see it expanding..."}}
