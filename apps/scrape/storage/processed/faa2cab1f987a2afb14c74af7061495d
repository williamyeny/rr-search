The mycelium will make its own heat as it colonizes the manure.  I wouldn't go over 75F with a large bulk substrate.  If the ambient temperature is 75F, the interior of the bin can easily be ten degrees warmer, and even warmer than that if the bin is insulated with cardboard or wrapped in a blanket to keep it dark, which is also of questionable need.<br /><br />I've experienced far less contamination by using layers of spawn rather than mixing it in.  The reason is that mixing causes some damage to the grains, which are then exposed to the contaminants that survive the pasteurization process.  If you spawn in layers, the spawn layer recovers very fast which then makes it resistant to contaminants as it colonizes the layers of manure.  When all goes well, a thorough mixing does colonize faster, but the risk of contamination is higher, thus I recommend layering.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pics with questions..."}}
