In addition, you don't know if it's contaminated until you use it, so all that wasted time on the slowest method is compounded even further when it fails, which is greater than 50% of the time.&nbsp; Inject your spores directly into the cakes for the fastest growth and best chance of success.<br />RR","title":"Re: 6 weeks into incubation - advice please.
