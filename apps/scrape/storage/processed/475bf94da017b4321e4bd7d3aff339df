If you had primordia and misted, that was a big mistake.  The picture is blurry, but it looks like I can see some primordia there.  Try removing the wax paper and get some very bright light on it.  Don't dry out the top of the substrate, but hit it with some intense light for a few hours.  Fluorescent is best because it's at 5500K which is close to sunlight, and produces little heat.  Incadescent lighting is worst because 90% of the energy expended is in producing heat and only ten percent goes towards light.  Also, incadescent lighting is at 3200k which is much closer to the red spectrum than the blue.<br /><br />Give plenty of air exchange, which is the most important pinning trigger of all after full colonization.<br /><br />Please don't bump your posts for 24 hours.
