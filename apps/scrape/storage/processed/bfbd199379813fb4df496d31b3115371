I assume the second quote is old info, just posted for ease of research.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><br /><b>(27 days ago)</b><br />Ideal pH of a substrate is 5.5 to 6.5, so you don't want to use lime in substrates.&nbsp; Use gypsum only, and it isn't for adjusting pH. Gypsum is for adding calcium and sulfur, both of which aid in fruitbody development, and both of which are usually lacking in most substrates. <br />RR <br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><br /><b>(2 years ago)</b><br />I like to shoot for an initial Ph of near 8. For this reason, hydrated lime is great. It works right away so it protects the substrate from mold spore germination while the mushroom mycelium is colonizing, but unable to fend for itself yet.<br /><br />Gypsum is for the elements, as you said, and as a Ph stabilizer as well. Gypsum changes Ph very little, but does lower it slightly.<br />RR<br /></blockquote><br /></blockquote><br /><br />In the second quote, I was probably referring to 'casing' and incorrectly typed the word 'substrate'. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif\" alt=\":tongue:\" title=\":tongue:\"/>&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, as does most fungi including molds.&nbsp; With casing layers which never colonize fully, you can protect them from molds by using a high pH which the established mushroom mycelium can tolerate better than mold spores can germinate in.<br /><br />For substrates, I don't use any pH buffer at all.&nbsp; In years past, I would buffer substrates, but then began experimenting a few years ago and found that mushroom mycelium will colonize an acidic substrate much faster.&nbsp; I believe this is the biggest reason coffee works so well in grain spawn.<br />RR","title":"Re: getting that PH of your sub jussssssst right...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
