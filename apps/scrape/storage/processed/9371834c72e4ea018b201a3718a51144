Disregard instructions that came with the chinese PC to the contrary since you're not using it to cook vegetables.<br /><br />In addition, the jars should be totally out of the water-not touching it at all.&nbsp; It sounds like you haven't watched the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek videos</a> yet.&nbsp; Watch all four before making your next batch.&nbsp; You're also supposed to put the foil over the top, not between the lid and ring, and you remove the foil when you remove the jars from the sterilizer.<br />RR","title":"Re: just pressure cooked jars for first time......they screwed?"}}
