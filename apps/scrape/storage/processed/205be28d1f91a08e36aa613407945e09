I shake every 3 days, or so (so maybe 6 times so far...)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Grain jars aren't going to be making many pins, so don't worry about it.&nbsp; Shake only once at about 20% colonization and don't shake again until the day you're going to spawn or do a grain to grain transfer.&nbsp; If you need to slow the mycelium down after full colonization, refrigerate.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you shake your jars too much?"}}
