Various species may or may not 'compete' with each other.&nbsp; I've seen alder logs in the forest with at least ten species of mushrooms happily fruiting at the same time within inches of each other.&nbsp; If they're 'competing', they're not doing a very good job of it.<br /><br />3. <i>Strains</i> of the same <i>species</i> can be easily combined without snake venom.<br /><br />4. Some strains are not compatible, but most are.&nbsp; If you inject the same cake with two strains of the same species, you might or might not get a cross(regardless, it isn't a hybrid).&nbsp; You may end up with one strain or the other, or a combination of the two.&nbsp; However, there's such little difference between strains that you'd probably never know anyway unless you wanted to send it off for dna testing along with each parent.<br /><br />5. Most compatible strains will 'combine' genetics via a process called <i>anastomosis</i>.&nbsp; &lt;-- Google it.<br /><br />6. If you don't know the answers to such questions, please avoid making shit up.&nbsp; It's sickening to see the amount of disinformation that gets spread on this and other boards, and then noobs repeat the BS to other noobs.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hybrid Species","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
