More air means less contamination, not more.  Remember, trichoderma, penicillium, and cobweb molds all thrive in still, stale air.  The only consideration is drying out your stuff.  If you have the fans running slow enough, that shouldn't be a problem.  Just monitor your humidity.<br /><br />I have a similar setup in my mini-greenhouse now, only using an AC unit instead of fans due to having it full of edibles that require cold shocking and cool fruiting chambers.  The AC supply enters at the bottom where the humidifier outputs are, then the return air is located at the top to draw air up through the shelves for cooling and to prevent humidity stratification.  I'm able to keep a steady 58F and 95% humidity with this setup.<br />RR","title":"Re: Automated fanning"}}
