I have some three to four year old master slants that I'll probably get out next year to see how they're doing.&nbsp; I've lost quite a few species after two years on slants, but having wood in the slant extends that time somewhat.<br /><br />That said, I try to make it a point to get my important cultures out once yearly to place on a petri dish, let grow for a week, and then inoculate fresh slants.&nbsp; The old ones can stay in storage, but it's good to always have fresh backups.&nbsp; When I get ready to grow, I look for the oldest date on a slant in storage, which will contain the youngest cell lines.<br />RR","title":"Re: Old Hands & TC's - Talking Long Term Storage"}}
