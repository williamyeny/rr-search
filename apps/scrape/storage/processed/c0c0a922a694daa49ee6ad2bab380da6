Most likely it was caused from drying out during the time from your dunk until now.  The only blue mold I know of is penicillium, and it's usually a perfectly round circle, and much darker. <br /><br />Just to repeat here for all to see, there is no need to throw away mushrooms from a mold contaminated cake.  Green and Blue/green molds are not pathogenic to humans, although you don't want to leave a contaminated cake in your grow area because it will puke spores all over everywhere, ruining your future projects.  Also, never sniff mold spores.  Don't eat a mushroom that is rotten or otherwise contaminated with bacteria, as that will give you food poisoning unless you boil it first.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bruising or Contamination?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
