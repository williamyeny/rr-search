If you pour the agar while it's too hot, you'll get lots of condensation.  If you're going to put the dishes in the oven, so so before your pour.  That way, there won't be a temperature differential between inside and outside and condensation will be reduced.  <br /><br />Keep the dishes in a vertical stack at all times.  Within a couple of days, the condensation will be re-absorbed back into the agar.  <br /><br />In my experience, glass petri dishes are not suitable for mycology due to the large number of dishes you need to conduct experiments.  They're also heavy and slippery when handled with gloves that are wet with alcohol, not to mention the trouble you go through cleaning and sterilizing them.  You can get a box of 500 pre-sterilized plastic petri dishes for the same price as 20 glass ones and they're far superior for our purposes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Excess of agar - Steam in petris","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
