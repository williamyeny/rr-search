The only thing we pack down is straw. Manure should be left loose and fluffy. I doubt it will be able to colonize like that, and there's a good chance it will go south due to contamination in the center where no air can reach.<br /><br />I'd suggest getting a room as clean as you can, then spray with oust or ten percent bleach to further clean the air.  Use latex gloves or a clean spoon and stir the entire contents to mix and fluff it up.  It wouldn't hurt at all to have a bit of moistened vermiculite to mix in as well, but the important thing is to get the substrate loose and aerated so the mycelium can penetrate.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: What should I do?"}}
