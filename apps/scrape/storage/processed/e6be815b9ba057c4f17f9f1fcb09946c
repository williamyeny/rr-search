Many years ago, I was cultivating 'woody stemmed plants' outdoors and had a terrible problem with nematodes destroying the root systems.  I noticed in areas where wild mushrooms would pop up around the plants, there was no nematode damage.  I then started burying my spent mushroom substrates into the soil around the unhealthy plants and noticed right away they'd pick up and get healthy again.  When I realized that it worked to control nematodes, I started spawning grains to manure for the sole purpose of mixing into the soil around the plants.<br /><br />Certain species of nematodes will eat the mycelium, but others will be digested by it.<br />RR","title":"Re: question about directions?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
