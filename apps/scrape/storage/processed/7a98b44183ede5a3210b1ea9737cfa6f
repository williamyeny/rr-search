Therefore, you must mist to make up for that lost moisture on a daily basis.&nbsp; The overspray from misting will get on the perlite, keeping it nice and damp as well.<br /><br />By the way, the 'cake' didn't absorb anything.&nbsp; The individual cells of mycelium must absorb the water by osmosis, which requires a higher pressure outside the cell than inside.&nbsp; If the cake is 'floating', it helps to put something on top to weight it down a bit to increase water pressure on the mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Newbie question on watering substrate of pinning cake."}}
