Once totally dry, they won't mold and you can store them until ready to use.<br /><br />Use them at up to fifty percent of any bulk substrate.  Actually, you can use coffee grinds as 100% of the substrate if you want.  I know a commercial oyster farm that uses free coffee from starbucks as their only substrate.  However, if you're growing cubes, mix the coffee with any other bulk substrate for a great boost.  They do NOT contaminate before you can get them colonized if you pasteurize first and have them at the proper moisture content.  As with all bulk substrates, add gypsum at up to ten percent by volume.<br /><br />Don't use them in a casing.  They're a bulk substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Awe Crap!
