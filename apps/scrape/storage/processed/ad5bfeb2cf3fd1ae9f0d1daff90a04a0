They'll be in a small box right next to the jars. You need to use the lids or your spawn/substrate will dry out too much.  Be sure to have the filter material on the outside of the lid so it won't get wet.  I use three 1/8\" holes in my lids because I don't want the grains hitting the filter material when I shake the jars.  If the filter gets wet with grain juice, it will contaminate right through it.<br />RR","title":"Re: MycoSupply Filter Discs.....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
