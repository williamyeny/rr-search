Horse manure is a substrate ingredient, not a casing material.  You don't want the casing to be more than 3/4\" with cubensis or it wastes too much time and energy trying to colonize it.  Further, a casing should be non-nutritious, so it signals the substrate below that it is running out of food and to start pinning.  The non-nutritious casing layer also should not fully colonize so you can mist the top layer and it will absorb the moisture and transfer it to the substrate below.<br /><br />Horse manure makes an excellent substrate, but a horrible casing.
