Pay special attention to the beveled mating surfaces of the cooker and lid, making sure there's no scratches or dings in that area. If there's no damage, it's fine.&nbsp; Spare/replacement parts, such as gauges, nozzles/weights, toggle valves, etc., are all readily available.&nbsp; $70 is a great deal even if it does need a new gauge or nozzle/weight assembly.<br />RR","title":"Re: How to test a pressure cooker","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
