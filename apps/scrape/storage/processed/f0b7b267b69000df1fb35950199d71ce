As Agar said, it's best <i>not</i> to shake after inoculation until jars are 20% to 30% colonized, especially if starting from spores.  The reason is that dikaryotic mycelium grows much faster than monokaryotic.  For that reason, you want your spores to all be germinating in close proximity to each other, so they can mate soon after germination, becoming the faster growing multi-nucleate mycelium.  If you force the monokaryotic mycelium to colonize the jar, it takes much longer.<br />RR","title":"Re: WBS quarts, how they lookin, should I be shakin?"}}
