Rather than the word 'than', I meant to type 'then,'. It's best not to re-case after a dunk.&nbsp; Good catch and thanks for finding that typo.&nbsp; It should have been the word <i>then</i> followed by a comma.<br />Recasing tends to favor contaminants because mold spores are constantly landing on your bulk substrate, and if you apply a casing layer over these mold spores, it protects them so they can germinate easier.<br />RR","title":"Re: God's Garden"}}
