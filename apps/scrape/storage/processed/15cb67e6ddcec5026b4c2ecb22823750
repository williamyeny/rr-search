Take pictures of the colonies in the vents and give them to the manager. Tell the managment it's making you really sick.  If nothing happens, take the pictures to your local health department and ask them what can be done.<br /><br />Until then, you'll have to double up on sterile procedures and keep all your projects filtered.  Never do sterile work with your AC on anyway, mold inside the ducts or not.<br /><br />You are correct.  Bleach doesn't kill molds or most other fungi.  That's why some members dunk in bleach water.  It kills bacteria and some insects/eggs, but most molds are resistant to it.
