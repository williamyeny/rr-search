The refrigerator is 35F to 45F which is cool enough to keep mycelium for the most part dormant.  Even cold weather fruiting species grow out their mycelial network in the summer months when temperatures are much warmer.<br /><br />I test strains by fruiting in a small tray spawned with one quart of rye and one quart of pasteurized manure.  This results in very fast colonization so I can quickly determine the keepers from the tossers.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this normal mycelium?"}}
