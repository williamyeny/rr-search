That is a myth that needs to be put to rest once and for all.  I like to pick before the spores drop though, cause it makes such a mess.  You can usually get 20% or more growth between veil tear and spore drop, although it's usually just a matter of a few hours.  Straw will yeild 80% of the fruit on the first flush.  It will flush again, but your growing space would be better utilized with a fresh project.  Hope this helps. ","title":"Re: When to pick when growing on straw?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
