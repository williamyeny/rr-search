Pf cakes already have enough verm in them, so you don't spawn them to more, since vermiculite has no nutrients or food for the mycelium. If you want to do a bulk grow, spawn your 16 jars to three or four times that amount of horse manure, or ten times that amount of straw.  You don't use a bottom layer.  If you choose to case the bulk substrate, peat/verm works well, but not verm by itself.<br /><br />Perlite is for humidifying a terrarium, not for mixing your spawn into.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about a potential yield","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
