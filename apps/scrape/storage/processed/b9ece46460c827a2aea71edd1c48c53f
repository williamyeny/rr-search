What matters is that a meat thermometer stuck into the middle of the manure reads 140F to 160F for a full hour.  Some people use a pillow case or ladies stocking and submerge it into the pasteurization bath, then wring out the excess moisture later.   I get the manure to the right moisture content first, then load into bags or jars and pasteurize in a large kettle of water.  Be sure to get a thermometer to use while you get your system dialed in.<br />RR","title":"Re: Drying out horse poo for pasteurization?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
