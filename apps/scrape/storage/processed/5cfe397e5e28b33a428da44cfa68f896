Our house is on the last piece of private land before the national forest, which we border on two sides. The mountain you see rising up from my back yard is our playground.&nbsp; It's where we hike and berry pick in the summer, and then sled and snowboard in the winter.&nbsp; We can sled right from the summit to within a few hundred feet of our back yard.&nbsp; Next summer, I'll trim some downed trees so we can slide right up to the back porch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Next spring, I'm going dig into the mountain and bury a couple of shipping containers to use for mushroom growing.&nbsp; The local grocery stores buy all the mushrooms I can grow, so It's time to expand. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif\" alt=\":laugh:\" title=\":laugh:\"/><br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/08-51/978973919-Home_Dec_19_2008.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/08-51/978973919-thumb_Home_Dec_19_2008.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: My website server"}}
