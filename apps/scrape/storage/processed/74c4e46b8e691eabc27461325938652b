They always burst after the cycle as the PC cools down.  If it cools too fast, the PC loses pressure before the inside of the bag cools down enough to lose pressure, thus the pressure differential between inside and outside the bag inflates it to the bursting point.   I've worked out a system to prevent that from happening, and it involves putting a tyvek sleeve in the bag, extending from the substrate up and to the outside of the bag.  You fold the end of the bag accordian style, with the tyvek between the folds.  This lets the bag expand to let the steam out, but as it contracts, the plastic seals to itself except where the tyvek is, and it serves as a filter.  I'm now batting 100% success with this method after several hundred bags, without a single contaminant or burst bag.  You wait to seal the bag until after inoculation with this method.<br /><br />It also doesn't matter if the bag touches the sides or not, provided you're using autoclavable filter patch bags.  I load my PC totally full right to the lid.<br />RR","title":"Re: spawn bag busted wtf!"}}
