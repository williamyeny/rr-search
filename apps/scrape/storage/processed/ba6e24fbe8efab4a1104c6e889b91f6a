I was basing that on the wet, greasy look of the grains, especially where they touch the glass.  <br /><br />You should be able to smell through the tyvek.  If the grains smell like garbage, or sweet, then it's bacillus, so toss them out.  Hopefully, they'll smell like fresh mushrooms.  Be sure to correct the gas exchange problem with your next batch.<br />RR","title":"Re: No mycelium after 3 weeks in rye jars"}}
