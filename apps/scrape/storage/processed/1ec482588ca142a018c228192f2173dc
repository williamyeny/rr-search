I think it would REALLY REALLY help me if someone posted some pics of healthy LC, and asls CONTAMED lc... ive seen quite a few pics of healthy lc... but not even one pic of a CONTAMED lc <br /></blockquote><br /><br />As I've been saying for years, you can't tell a healthy vs contaminated LC by looking.&nbsp; That's why I've advised against making them since this whole LC fad started.&nbsp; Growers are doing themselves a disservice making LC instead of using their spores to inoculate brf or grains, where they'll know in a matter of a week or two if they're contaminated or not.&nbsp; With LC, you wait three or four times that long, and then <i>still</i> don't know until you go back to stage one, and inoculate grains or brf with them.&nbsp; LC simply and frankly doesn't make sense. This is why I've never posted an LC from spores tek, and never will.<br /><br />If you guys want to take cultivation to the next logical step, learn to do agar work.&nbsp; Then you'll know within days if your spores are good or not, and you can easily isolate healthy mycelium away from molds and bacteria, thereby saving a culture from a dirty print.<br />RR","title":"Re: Kamis honey LC, a decision to be made *pics*","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
