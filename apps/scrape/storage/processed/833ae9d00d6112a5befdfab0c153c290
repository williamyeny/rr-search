There is a lot of information on them here.  They grow well on horse manure with thin substrates and a very thin peat/verm casing layer.  Strain really doesn't matter any more than it matters with cubes.<br /><br />P cyans and azures are for outdoor grows in the proper climate. A few expert growers have managed to get a couple of small harvests indoors, but it's certainly not recommended.<br /><br />Edibles and medicinals are also a lot of fun and very healthy too, not to mention great cover for your hobby from relatives.  Just give them a bowl of oysters and they'll always love ya.  Reishi is extremely easy to grow and a great one to learn sawdust substrates, and oysters grow great on straw logs or sawdust.  See the other thread in this forum on edibles for more information.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ive grown ps.cubensis I want to try a new species...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
