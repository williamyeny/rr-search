In addition, if the air inside your incubator is at 30C, the bottom of the aquarium where it's sitting on the heating pad is much hotter.  I suspect you have burned up/dried out your jars.  Never set an aquarium or anything else on a heating pad.  If you don't heat your house, you might try putting the heating pad <i>above</i> the aquarium, but not below it which is not only a fire hazard, but cooks the substrate in your jars.  If you heat your house to normal room temperature, then just get rid of the incubator.<br /><br />I incubate at normal room temperature on an open shelf and my pf jars are fully colonized in two to two and a half weeks, even in winter, and I'm only 100 miles south of the Canadian border.  Personally, I think incubators cause more problems than they solve.  I recently left a batch of jars in my brothers unheated garage for a month after inoculation, and when I went to get them, they were fully colonized.  The temperature in his garage never went above 50F/10C during that entire time, so why mess with incubators?<br />RR","title":"Re: Why has the mycelium stopped?"}}
