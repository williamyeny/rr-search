High temp RTV is for engine repairs and gaskets, and should be cured around 400F. I seal exhaust leaks on my old Harleys and trucks with high temp RTV as an example.&nbsp; For your use, regular silicone caulk is what you want and it's rated up to over 300F, well above pressure cooker temperatures.<br /><br />Third, metal lids are vastly superior.&nbsp; When they rust, use a green scouring pad to clean them.&nbsp; When they get too rusty and worn out, replace.","title":"Re: Silicon Issues"}}
