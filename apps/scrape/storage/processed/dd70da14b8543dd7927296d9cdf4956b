This can happen easily if your substrate shrinks and you handle it, creating an air space between the substrate and its tray. I know guys who cut drain holes in the bottom of their trays also get lots of bottom pinning due to air exchange down there.<br />RR","title":"Re: mushrooms are ungrateful fucktards...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
