Otherwise, I don't understand.  I use grains with the standard two piece mason jar lids(two or three 1/16\" holes drilled) and synthetic filter disks.  I always tighten the lids fully, then use foil to keep water from dripping on the filter from above.  This is not a problem.  The lids always come loose very easily.  Be sure to NOT leave lids loose on grain jars.  Any air exchanges that occur as the PC cools will allow contaminants to possibly slip around the filter disk or tyvek as opposed to passing through it.  On a pf jar, the verm barrier will stop these contaminants whether the lid is loose or tight.  On grain jars, be sure to fully tighten the lids.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lids tight Vs.
