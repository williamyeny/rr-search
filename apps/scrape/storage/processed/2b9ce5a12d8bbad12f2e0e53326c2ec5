It is not what I have observed. And if you really believe this, then why not shut down the Damion Coir tek thread as misinformation?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It doesn't 'ruin' the coir.&nbsp; In fact, I sterilize straw and coffee grinds when I add them to my sawdust blocks.&nbsp; They are no more prone to contamination because I also keep them sterile until fully colonized.&nbsp; What I said is that mixing manure, straw, or compost, etc., into the coir and <i>then</i> adding boiling water is going to lead to an increased rate of contamination, as many growers here have found out the hard way.<br />RR","title":"Re: How omnipresent are thermophilic microbes in the environment?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
