It's true you get fruits sooner by fruiting uncased, and the humidity can be maintained with a sheet of wax paper over the top of the substrate tray.  However, the casing layer supplies moisture to the substrate when you mist, which an uncased substrate can't easily absorb.  <br /><br />Yes, you can inject water with a syringe, and also can pour a small amount around the edges when they start to pull away from the sides a bit.  Be very careful though when doing this that you don't saturate/waterlog your substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Poo fruiting humidity question"}}
