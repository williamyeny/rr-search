It's really clear in the bottom picture, left hand side of the jar.  I see a distinct line of separation between the mushroom mycelium and the pink mold, probably lipstic mold.<br /><br />The half pint in the first two pictures has a small blotch of bacteria near the center of the picture.  That may or may not be a problem.  Sometimes the mycelium runs right over bacteria.  Just keep an eye on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: contaim? - pictures"}}
