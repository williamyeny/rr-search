Mushroom mycelium can have several types from cottony to rhizomorphic.<br /><br />The speed of colonization falls off very rapidly at 86F and above, and that figure is for mycelium temperature, not air temperature.  Mycelium temperature is always a few degrees higher due to thermogenesis.  I prefer 70F to 80F for an ambient air temperature.<br />  <br />The biggest cause besides contaminants for stalled jars however, is running out of oxygen.  Make sure the holes are open so gasses can exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: White Stringy Myc."}}
