I propped it back up on the risers and checked it a few minutes later and the RH is back in the 90's.<br /><br />Does CO2 hold less humidity than O2? I'm wondering why increasing the flow of air on the bottom would raise the RH?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It's because of the engineering behind a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; The majority of air enters through the bottom holes, and then rises up through the perlite as it travels to the fruiting part of the tub.&nbsp; As the air passes through the perlite, it absorbs moisture, raising the humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: Low RH suggests high CO2?"}}
