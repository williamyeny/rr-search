Normally, we inject the spores against the edge of the jar, so we see the growth right away.<br /><br />At day 23, properly prepared pf cakes should be at or near full colonization.<br /><br />Mushroom growth slows down dramatically at any temp above 83F, so you're definitely hurting them by the excess heat.  You shouldn't let the temp in your incubator exceed 81F.  I use an open shelf at normal room temp and pf jars colonize fully in less than 23 days.<br />RR","title":"Re: possibly a good sign?"}}
