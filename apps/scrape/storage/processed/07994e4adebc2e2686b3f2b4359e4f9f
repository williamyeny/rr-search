Even with foil on the jars, the rapidly boiling water will work up under the foil and get in.&nbsp; This isn't a problem with quart/liter size jars, but it's definitely a problem with 1/2 pints.&nbsp; By keeping the jars out of the water, the problem is solved.&nbsp; <br /><br />This doesn't mean if the water comes 1/2 inch up from the bottom of the jars it will ruin them, but more than that and it will.&nbsp; However, if we say 1/2\" to the fractionally literate among us, they'll read it as 1/2 way up the jars and then wonder why their moisture content got ruined.<br /><br />I hope that makes it clear.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is it absolutely necessary to us a pressure cooker when growing?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
