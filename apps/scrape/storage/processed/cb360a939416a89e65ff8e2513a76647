You can't expect more than that from an inch and a half of plain bird seed in a breadpan.  Nothing wrong with that pinset either.  When you see pins covering every square inch of the surface, and they all mature into large, healthy fruits, it's from using proper technique WITH a proved strain.  It would be very rare indeed to get what you're looking for with a thin layer of cased bird seed and multispore inoculation in a small pan.  Just pick the fruits as they mature.  No, the one mature one is not your whole first flush.  They rarely all mature at the exact same time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Truely pathetic..","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
