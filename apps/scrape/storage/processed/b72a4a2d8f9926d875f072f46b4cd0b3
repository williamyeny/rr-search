Coffee grinds, coir, straw, worm castings, etc., all make great additives.  If you're using bagged cow manure, a bit of vermiculite will help keep it from compacting.  You can use up to 10% gypsum by volume the amount of manure/compost for a nice boost.<br /><br />Use one part colonized cakes or other spawn to three or four parts manure.  Just eyeball the measurement.  That will get you close enough.  It's pretty easy to figure a handfull of spawn to three or four handfulls of manure.<br /><br />However, to correct your nomenclature, that isn't 'casing'.  It's what we call 'spawning to bulk'.  Casing is later on, when you apply a casing layer over the fully colonized manure.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trying 2 Case"}}
