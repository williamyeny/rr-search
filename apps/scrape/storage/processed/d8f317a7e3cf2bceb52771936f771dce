I get wheat straw whenever I can, but often in certain times of the year or areas, barley straw is all I can find.  It still works great as well. Green is usually grass, which packs down too much.  Straw should be hollow inside which is what makes it work so well.  The hollow interior stores water for the flush, while allowing the mycelium to colonize the outside easily.<br /><br />Even in large cities, there should be a feed store nearby.  You can get large bales for the same price as craft or pet stores sell small bales for.  Feed stores also are excellent for finding lime, oyster shells, and gypsum at reasonable prices.<br />RR","title":"Re: What kind of straw?"}}
