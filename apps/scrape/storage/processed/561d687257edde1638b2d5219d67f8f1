I only suggested a way to catch drips.  I take a knife and slit the plastic from top to bottom in several places to provide constant fresh air exchange.  The humidifiers can easily keep up.  The more air exchange in a fruiting envioronment, the better the mushrooms do, and the worse the contaminants which like stale air do.<br />RR","title":"Re: Greenhouse Help - Bottom Tray?"}}
