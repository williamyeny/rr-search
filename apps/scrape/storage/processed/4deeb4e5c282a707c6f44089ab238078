These were jars I started before I moved to my cabin, and didn't have time to start any projects last summer, so they sat in the barn/carport for 10 months. The mycelium began growing again as soon as they were brought inside.&nbsp; I've already fruited a couple of those jars, thus -30F is very survivable if they're on rye grains.<br /><br />In fact, this accidental discovery led me to make up a bunch of master culture slants with rye berries instead of agar, and they've all been in my chest freezer for over a month now.&nbsp; I'll get them out in a year and see how they held up.<br />RR","title":"Re: Would 40ÂºF temps (for two days) 'kill' myc?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
