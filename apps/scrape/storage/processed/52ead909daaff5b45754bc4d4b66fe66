I recommend against it.  Some beginning growers do it so that if they overmist, the verm soaks it up.  However, if you fail to overwater, the verm draws moisture from your substrate.  The verm on bottom can also cause the mycelium to pin there instead of on the top where you want it to.<br />I have no idea what accesstwo is trying to say.  A casing is totally different from the substrate.  The casing is a non-nutritive layer that is placed over the top of the substrate to provide moisture and a humid microclimate that will help stimulate pinning, then provide moisture to sustain the flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: The importance of putting moist verm under substait?"}}
