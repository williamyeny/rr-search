Use whatever means you have, but if they're sitting in water, it will splash up and under the foil, ruining the moisture content.  1 pint jars can have the water around the bottom, but don't let the water come more than a third of the way up them.  Make darn sure they're not sitting on the bottom of the PC, or they'll come out cracked and/or broken.<br /><br />The foil is to protect the holes from dripping water that falls off the lid of the PC.  Due to the temperature difference, condensation forms on the lid and rains back down on the jars during the whole cycle.  That's why we use foil.  Steam doesn't enter the holes.  <br /><br />It sounds like you made two jars too wet, and the other two too dry.  The dry ones should be ok because you can soak 24 hours at full colonization.  'Field capacity' is not a measurement to use with the brf tek.  It's one cup water, one cup brf, and two cups verm, or any amount as long as the ratio is 1-1-2.  65 ml is a bit light, and depending on your definition of field capacity, those two are probably too wet.<br />RR","title":"Re: Learning experience...(with coffee solution)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
