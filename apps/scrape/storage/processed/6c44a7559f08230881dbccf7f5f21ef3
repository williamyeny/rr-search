Thats the sign that it is too high.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Please don't repeat inaccurate information.  Mushrooms thrive in 100% humidity.  Mushrooms are also 100% <i>composed</i> of mycelium.  That's what they are.  'Fuzz' on the stems, contrary to popular myth is NOT a problem, and is NOT caused by high humidity.<br /><br />Tony, it sounds like what you have is a genetic, strain related issue.<br /><br />Never heat a terrarium.  Run a small heater and heat the room in which it's located.  Heating a terrarium causes your humidity to turn into condensation on the walls and then your crop dries out from low humidity which IS a problem.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: what is wrong with my shrooms","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
