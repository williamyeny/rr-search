What you wanted to ask was, \"what is the best <i>spawn</i> medium\".   Items such as wbs, corn, rye, millet, etc., are spawn materials.  <br /><br />Now, here's where the nomenclature can get confusing because if you don't spawn your rye or millet to manure, but instead spread it out and put a casing layer on it, the rye or millet spawn then <i>becomes</i> the substrate.<br /><br />The casing is the non-nutritious layer above that which the mushrooms actually grow on.<br />RR","title":"Re: Whats the best substrate for poo?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
