If it's colonized, it needs the duct tape off the holes.  I'm no fan of using polyfill around a fruiting chamber either.  You don't need to filter the air in a terrarium, besides, the lids don't fit air tight anyway, so it's silly to use polyfill in the holes.  In addition, after full colonization, air exchange is the most important pinning trigger, even more so than light.<br /><br />If it's fully colonized, get the tape off the holes and let it have fresh air.<br />RR","title":"Re: RR I need you again brotha!!!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
