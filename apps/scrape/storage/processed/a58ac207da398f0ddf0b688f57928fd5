It's an accepted method of pasteurization, and live mycelium can withstand up to ten percent bleach, which is much stronger than any of the teks call for.&nbsp; Lime is also an acceptable method, thus I combine lime and hot water for great results, as demonstrated in the video.<br /><br />I disagree about sterilizing straw unless you're going to inoculate and colonize it under sterile conditions.&nbsp; If you're making straw logs that get holes punctured right after making them up, then you don't want to sterilize.&nbsp; We pasteurize to kill mold spores, not bacteria, many of which generally survive the pasteurization process.<br />RR","title":"Re: Straw Logs keep going green??? help","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
