Toss them out.  Properly made pf jars should colonize in two weeks, three max.  If they take longer than that, something is wrong.  <br />You can put some manure or straw in a hole in a shady part of your back yard and mix the cakes in with that, then cover with a 1/2\" layer of soil.  Often they'll recover and fruit normally outdoors.<br />RR","title":"Re: Colonization Problems"}}
