MH is known to cause early pinning in jars because of the high frequency light output of MH.  However HPS is more of a red light at the lower end of the spectrum, so it shouldn't be that bad.  I'd still move the jars away from it.  The heat could cause problems.   There is no need to keep colonizing jars in the dark, but there is also no need to expose them to very bright lights either.  When fruiting time comes, you'll probably do better to get a natural daylight fluorescent.   The 6500K color temperature seems to stimulate primordia formation better than the lower color temperatures of lamps such as incandescent and HPS.<br />RR","title":"Re: Too Much Light?"}}
