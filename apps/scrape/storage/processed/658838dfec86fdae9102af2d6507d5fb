Mushroom mycelium grows fastest with a slightly <i>acid</i> ph.  You don't Ph adjust spawn.  The only reason we use Ph buffers to raise Ph in bulk substrates is because mushroom mycelium, while it prefers a Ph of 6, is <i>tolerant</i> of Ph up to 8.5, while trichoderma is not tolerant of a high Ph.  Thus, the hydrated lime or oyster shell flour makes our substrate selective for mushroom mycelium.<br /><br />You shouldn't have used the oyster shell in with your spawn.  Spawn is grown out in sterile jars with filters where trichoderma isn't a problem if the jars were prepared and inoculated properly.  If they were not, the Ph buffer won't help anyway.<br />RR","title":"Re: pH of corn","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
