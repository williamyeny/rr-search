The only real time you need to put your trays in the dark is during casing run.  This allows the casing layer to colonize partially without the additional pinning trigger of light acting on it.  At the proper time, you expose to light, increase FAE, and have full colonization all at the same time.  This results in the best possible pinset.  Read Hyphae's pinning strategy in his sig for more information on timing these events.<br /><br />There is no point in putting it into the dark now that it's already pinning.  The fluoros you have will be plenty, but try to attach or hang them higher so they can give better direction to the fruits as they grow.  It will also help hyphal knots to form if you'll have the light <i>above</i> the casing layer because it will penetrate deeper into it, thus helping to trigger knots.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cubensis Light Cycle / Casing Pictures","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
