Cottonseed hulls/meal and coffee grinds are excellent substrate additives.  Cotton seed meal doesn't need to break down to become available.  It becomes available as soon as the mycelium consumes it.<br /><br />Don't use blood meal because it doesn't do much good unless it's been composted in a pile.  Fish emulsion does no good at all.  Remember, mushrooms are not plants and need to <i>eat</i> their food to get energy.  They don't get energy from the sun, so fertilizers are useless.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coir as substrate."}}
