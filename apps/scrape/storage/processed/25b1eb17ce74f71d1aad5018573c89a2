Your jars probably dried out, since a single 1/2\" hole would be more than enough. <br /><br />My experience with half gallon and larger jars is they need to be incubated at an angle of 45 degrees to allow for gas exchange.  They get stagnant standing upright with the lid/filter only on top.<br />RR","title":"Re: How important is gas exchange after innoculating a substrate?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
