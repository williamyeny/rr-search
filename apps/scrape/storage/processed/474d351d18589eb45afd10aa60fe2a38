I'm locking any more that pop up. We let Cervantes strain thread slide, and it's spawned all these, just as I was afraid would happen. I won't make that mistake again.&nbsp; The problem is it fools noobs into thinking the name on the print actually makes a shit.&nbsp; PE tends to look different, and that appearance carries over even when grown from spores.&nbsp; However, PE also generates lots of low potency strains, just like any other cube, which it is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Only a pure, single sector isolate deserves to be called a strain.<br /><br />If anyone tried to print a shiitake or oyster, etc., and sell the spores to commercial growers as a strain, they'd get laughed out of the community for being a dumbass.&nbsp; Obviously, you have to isolate if you want to find the best performing strains, and it doesn't matter the name somebody wrote on the print you isolate from.&nbsp; Cubes are cubes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Preliminary (possibly pointless) PE Potency plus Popularity Poll, peeps!"}}
