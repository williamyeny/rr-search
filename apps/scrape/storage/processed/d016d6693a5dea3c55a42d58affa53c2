Bleach doesn't kill fungi.&nbsp; It's why some people pasteurize in very strong bleach water.&nbsp; It kills bacteria but not molds/fungi. It's always best to toss out contaminated substrates.&nbsp; They infect future grows and make your efforts counterproductive.&nbsp; New growers often report just what you are, but after a few months they come back and say they'll never do it again.<br /><br />Attempting to cut trich out of a substrate doesn't work.&nbsp; The mycelium is white and mixes with the mushroom mycelium.&nbsp; It's only the spores that are green.&nbsp; In addition, it spreads the spores everywhere, raising your ambient trich load, and contaminating future grows.<br />RR","title":"Re: The green monster","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
