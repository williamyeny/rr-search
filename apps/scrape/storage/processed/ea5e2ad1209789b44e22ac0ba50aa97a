Spray the face of the filter lightly with Lysol before each use.&nbsp; This will kill any bacteria or mold spores which have landed on the exposed surface.&nbsp; Allow the flowhood to run for at least an hour in this small room before starting your sterile work.&nbsp; By doing so, the air in the room will have circulated and then re-circulated through the filter many times, thus that .001% you're worried about becomes .00001% and then .000000001%, etc., with each pass.<br /><br />You're far more likely to contaminate your work by allowing your hands to come between the filter and your exposed media than for what slips through to reach your work.&nbsp; The video shows how to properly position your hands(surgical-gloved of course) to mitigate this problem.&nbsp; The video also shows how to properly open jars and petri dishes to ensure that no contaminants can enter, and gives tips on how to prevent <i>yourself</i> from being the number 1 vector of contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hepa hood operating questions","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
