That's at least five times the price it should be.<br /><br />Rye grass seed makes excellent spawn, but it's a bit harder to get the moisture just right.  That's why I prefer rye berries, but rye grass seed works great.<br /><br />I recently bought 10 pounds of rye grass seed for $2.50, so don't let Lowes rip you off.  Go to any local nursery if that's what you're going to use.<br /><br />I prefer rye berries because the size of the grains leaves just enough space between the grains to allow air to ciruclate, but not so much that your jar is full of wasted space, such as with popcorn.  I buy 25 pound bags of organic rye berries for $8.75 in a large city, so it's certainly available.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this rye okay? Or does it have to be \"rye berries\"???"}}
