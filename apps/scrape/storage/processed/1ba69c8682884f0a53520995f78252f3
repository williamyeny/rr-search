If you wait too long, they'll start fruiting right in the jar. <br /><br />Consolidate at least a week, but two or three or four, etc., is fine too.&nbsp; Birth your jars all at once or one at a time, your choice.<br /><br />Colonize and fruit at normal room temperature.&nbsp; Dropping temperature with tropical species such as cubes is not a pinning trigger, and in fact will delay fruiting.&nbsp; Colonizing above normal room temperature will result in a higher rate of contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question on consolidation"}}
