Just get the loose stuff, and don't worry about what the mycelium has colonized.  Remember, it was the filter, so has contaminants on it.  When you roll the soaking wet cake in dry verm, the verm sticks to it all over, becoming in effect a casing layer that covers the whole cake.  Mist well several times over the next few hours after placing into fruiting conditions to hydrate the verm until it's nice and damp.<br />RR","title":"Re: After Dunk and Roll","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
