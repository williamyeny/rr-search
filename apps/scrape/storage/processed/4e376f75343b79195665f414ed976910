(W/O blowing the breaker or starting a fire, tyvm.)<br />can i use an extension cord to wire this?<br />if so, what colors go together? <br /><br />i grow better than i construct flowhoods, i swear!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />There should be a data plate which will have the wiring diagram.&nbsp; Post a picture of it.&nbsp; Sounds like a multispeed motor, but you need the diagram to know which wires to hook up and which to tie together or insulate from each other.<br />RR","title":"Re: please help, brain hurts, hit with flowhood.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
