However, sterilization will give a higher rate of contamination then doing nothing.<br /><br />You have to assume that mold spores are going to land on your casing layer.  If it's been sterilized, they will germinate and grow because nothing else is there to stop them.  The beneficial bacteria that are in peat moss will help protect against molds such as trichoderma, and some of these will survive the pasteurization process, which should kill all the mold spores that are present at the time.<br /><br />You can do a search under my name and 'casing tek' and 'pasteurization tek' and find how I do it.<br /><br />Once the casing layer is in place, the key to preventing molds is proper air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilization measures for the casing layer","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
