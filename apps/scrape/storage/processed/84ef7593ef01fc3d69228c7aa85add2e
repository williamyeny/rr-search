Don't twist them off because it damages the cake and green mold often follows in the divot left behind.<br /><br />You don't need a naked cake to soak.&nbsp; You can soak with pins.&nbsp; Use 12 hours after harvesting all the fruits rather than the 24 hours we soak prior to first flush.<br /><br />Furthermore, you don't have to dunk.&nbsp; You can set a cake full of mushrooms in a saucer of water for a few hours if it needs moisture mid-flush.&nbsp; Alternatively you can pile up some vermiculite on top of the cake and keep that soaked.<br />RR","title":"Re: Harvesting Singular Shrooms, Flushing, and Dunking?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
