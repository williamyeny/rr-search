Noobs also obsess over humidity for some reason when fresh air and light are far more important.<br />Such is not the purpose of this site, nor has science developed transducers which will operate in the conditions we require.&nbsp; Lazy people always fail at this because you quite frankly need to be checking your crop several times daily to remove moldy substrates and do other chores.<br />RR","title":"Re: Automated Chamber- would this work?"}}
