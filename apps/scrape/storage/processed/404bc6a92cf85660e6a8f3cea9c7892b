I've grown on 100% spent coffee grinds, as have many growers.  It's an excellent substrate.<br /><br />Possibly, your substrate is too wet.  Field capacity in a bulk substrate means no more than several drops should squeeze out when you take a handfull and squeeze very hard.  If a small stream runs out, make sure it stops within a second or two.  Otherwise, it's too wet.<br />RR","title":"Re: CCC stalling again"}}
