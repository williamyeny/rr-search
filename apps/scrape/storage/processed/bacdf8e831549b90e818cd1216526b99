To anyone who can't grasp this simple fact, I apologize.&nbsp; <br /><br />This thread has gone on long enough.&nbsp; I thought if it was kept open, those who had trouble grasping this most basic fact of physics 101 could learn, but apparently not.&nbsp; Sorry. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: can i sterilize jars in an oven????????","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
