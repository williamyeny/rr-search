Dunking won't hurt small pins, so don't pick them off if they're there.  I make cakes on the dry side so they'll colonize faster, and then dunk and roll before first flush, and again between flushes.<br /><br />It's also a good idea after harvesting a flush, to let the cake sit for a few days prior to the dunk for a resting period.  This tends to make the next flush more prolific than if you dunk right after picking.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question on birthing and rehydrating pf cakes"}}
