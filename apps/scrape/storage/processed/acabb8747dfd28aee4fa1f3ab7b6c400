I've seen no evidence of it whatsoever.  My only objection is the dismissal of the possibility due to pre-conceived opinion.  Such is not science, but religion.<br /><br />Jeetered, make another racist statement about dot-heads and you're going to feel my wrath.  Your ancestors walked across on a land bridge, my ancestors came across on a boat, and the so-called illegals you despise swim and walk across a river.  There ARE NO native americans. That term is an insult to our intellegence. Human life did not evolve in the western hemisphere.  Check your racism and hatred at the door please.<br />RR","title":"Re: Moon and inoculation","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
