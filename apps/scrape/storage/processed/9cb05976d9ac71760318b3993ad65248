Plain peat would work better, but a 50/50 mix of the two seems to work better than either one by itself.<br />Be sure to lime the peat at the rate of one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat and add at least a tablespoon or two of gypsum per cup of peat. You can use gypsum up to 10% by volume of the amount of peatmoss. If you have a ph tester, go for an initial ph of 8 to 8.5.<br />You want your casing layer on the top.  Don't apply casing to the bottom.<br />RR","title":"Re: quick casing question. anyone?"}}
