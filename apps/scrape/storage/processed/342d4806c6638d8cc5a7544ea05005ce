Lowering your temperature in your FC with PF cakes even more(ex. from 70-75 down to 64-68)AT NIGHT with indirect SUNLIGHT(day) through a window for about 5 hours a day(remember youre FC protects youre cakes from the sun as well as the window) DOES ABSOLUTE WONDERS COME PINNING TIME! This isnt a fact, just personaly experience. Thank you guys so much for reading and i look forward to contributing accurate and helpful information to the epic shroomery.</blockquote><br />Actually, it's fact.<br />A day/night temperature differential works wonders for a good pinset and healthy growth, as does some <i>direct sunlight</i> every day.&nbsp; I've long advised growers with stubborn substrates to put them out in direct sunlight for at least several minutes a day until pinning starts.&nbsp; After that, bright fluorescent or bright indirect sunlight for several hours per day is needed.&nbsp; A best-case scenario is a 12/12 light/dark cycle using lights, with a bit of direct/indirect sunlight tossed in during the 12 hour lighting time.<br />RR","title":"Re: New member, long lurker brings some advice to fellow members on Pinning."}}
