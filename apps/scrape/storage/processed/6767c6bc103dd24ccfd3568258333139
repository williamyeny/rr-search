Peroxide is toxic to spores and young, not well established mycelium.  In fact, don't use peroxide on ANYTHING except to kill Dactylium on casing layers.<br /><br />Unless it's a HUGE bag, don't use over three to five ml of spore solution or liquid.  More than that will be too much and throw off your moisture content.<br />RR<br /><br />","title":"Re: Help with filter patch bags"}}
