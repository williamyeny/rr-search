In addition, the knife spreads the mold into good areas of the cake or tray, compounding the problem further. Toss out contaminated substrates on first sight, placing them in a compost or manure pile outdoors where they may recover and fruit at a later time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ways to conquer contam?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
