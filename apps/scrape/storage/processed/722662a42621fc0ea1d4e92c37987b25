They seem to be all the buzz these days in the OMC, but like using popcorn spawn, or coir for casing layers, I feel they're a fad that will soon fade away.   Commercial growers use liquid cultures, but never with honey, karo or any of the common methods we see employed here.  They use malt and yeast with a constant magnetic stirrer, after proven contaminant free mycelium has been blended with an Eberbach and placed into the medium.  In fact, honey is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  That's why it's been used for thousands of years as a preservative.  Other growers of course will disagree, but that proves there's always more than one way to do things.<br /><br />I would recommend you use your syringe to start some pf cakes, or as I do when starting a new vendor supplied culture, make up some rye grain jars, then in your glovebox, simply lift the lid a half inch on one side and squirt the liquid down the side of the glass jar.  Be sure to wear latex gloves that have been washed with alcohol, and follow all sterile procedures. Work fast, leaving the lid open for the minimum amount of time possible.  If you're set on using LC, try your luck with Karo syrup.  Use no more than 3% by volume, mixed with distilled or filtered water. Good luck with the learning process.  I know it can be frustrating at first.<br />RR","title":"Re: Honeywater LC = Not My Friend"}}
