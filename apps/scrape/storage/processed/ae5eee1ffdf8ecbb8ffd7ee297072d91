However, the reason is not to allow the middle to finish.  I doubt seriously the outside would get done without the middle also being done, since each inoculation point to the middle of the jar is no farther than each inoculation point to the top and bottom of the jar.<br /><br />We wait one week after full colonization to allow the mycelium to digest a bit more of the food it has colonized, thus allowing it to consolidate its hold on the substrate.  It won't fruit before this week passes anyway, so it's best to leave in the jars.  After a week, birth the jars, dunk and roll, and then place into fruiting conditions.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycelium Question"}}
