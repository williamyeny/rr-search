If you fail to replace the water that is evaporating, performance will be poor.&nbsp; It shouldn't be hard to pick up your cake and judge moisture content by weight.&nbsp; If you haven't been misting well, pile up a tablespoon or two of vermiculite on top of the cake and soak it well.&nbsp; Another option is to put the cake in a saucer of water overnight.<br /><br />Also, don't worry about picking up your cakes.&nbsp; Just wash your hands well with soap and water first.&nbsp; You can also rinse the cake under the faucet again if you're worried.<br />RR","title":"Re: Signs of dry BRF cakes","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
