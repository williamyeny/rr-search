You should NEVER shake a brf jar at any time because it destroys the vermiculite filter on top allowing contaminants to enter, and you should NEVER shake a grain jar at inoculation.  Shaking right after inoculating with spores SLOWS down colonization.  When a spore germinates, monokaryotic(one nucleus per cell) mycelium emerges, which is very slow growing.  When monokaryotic mycelium meets a compatible hyphae from another spore, they exchange information and the cell lines become dikaryotic, meaning two or more nuclei per cell.   Dikaryotic mycelium is much faster growing than monokaryotic, so you want all your spores germinating in close proximity to each other so the 'mating' process can take place soon after germination.  A week later when the grain jar is 20% to 30% colonized, you give it the one and only shake.<br /><br />To repeat, never shake brf jars at any time.  It fucks them up.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shaking jars...?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
