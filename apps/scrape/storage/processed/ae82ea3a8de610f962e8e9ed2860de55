Mushrooms grow by cell division.&nbsp; Obviously there's some engorgement with water too, but primordia do not have all the cells a mature mushroom will have.&nbsp; Whoever first pulled that bullshit out of his ass should be tarred and feathered because for some unknown reason, people keep repeating it. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br /><br />Higher spawn ratios only help speed colonization minimally. Once the mycelium gets going, it will generally double in size every day.&nbsp; This means that after a week or so, the difference in colonization between a high and low spawn rate isn't much, assuming of course proper pasteurization and no contamination. <br /><br />Growers should experiment with high and low spawn rates for each strain they grow.&nbsp; Some prefer a more nutritious substrate than others, so these can benefit from a higher spawn rate.&nbsp; Strains which prefer a lower nutrient level will often grow mutants and blobs instead of mushrooms on the first flush as the mycelium consumes the excess grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn to Sub ratio questions","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
