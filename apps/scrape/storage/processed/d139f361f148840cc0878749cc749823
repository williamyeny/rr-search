I think it's important to assume the results are <i>not</i> from what we suspect until after many trials. That's just good science. I've posted for years that ten percent bleach won't kill mushroom mycelium(or molds), but I have never noticed an <i>increase</i> in performance after using it.  I'm not saying there isn't a correlation either, but the jury needs to remain out until more trials by other growers come in. Research is how we all learn. Good luck to all!<br />RR","title":"Re: bleach misting."}}
