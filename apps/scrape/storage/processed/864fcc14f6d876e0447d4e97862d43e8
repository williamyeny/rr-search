Adjust the wingnuts until they just barely get snug, then give each one about 1/8 turn.  Don't make them tight.  They only need to be tight enough to get a seal.<br /><br />I use a bit of vaseline about the size of a kernel of corn on my finger to lube the seal.  I apply the lube to both the lid and the PC.  Be sure to wipe the old vaseline off with a paper towel or by washing.  If you don't, dust and dirt stick to the grease and will eventually wear out the seal.<br /><br />Turn the stove on high, leave the weight off, and allow to warm up until steam escapes for five minutes or so.  I wait until I can see a bit of pressure beginning to build on the guage before I put the weight on.  Watch the pressure build.  At about 13 psi, a hiss will be heard as steam begins to escape.  At this point, you can reduce heat slightly because the weight will begin to rattle very soon.  I reduce the heat during the cycle anytime the weight rattles.  I consider four times per minute too much.   Adjust so the constant steam is escaping, but no rattling occurs.  This will keep your kitchen much quieter and you'll use less water during the cycle. The rattling of the weight is actually letting excess steam pressure escape.  If you're cooking agar and the weight rattles very much at all, the agar will boil over and you'll open the PC to a mess.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about how everyone uses there All American...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
