If you're making grape jelly, you're on the wrong forum.  If you're wanting to grow mushrooms, you need to read the tek before buying jars.  Every grocery store worth a nickle will have 1/2 pint jars, and you can't sterilize anything in a crock pot.<br />RR","title":"Re: spores","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
