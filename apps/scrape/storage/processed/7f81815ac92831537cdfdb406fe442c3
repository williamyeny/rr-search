That way you won't let all the heat out when you open the doors to enter and the deeper bit of ground back there can serve as additional insulation.</blockquote><br />Good point.<br />That's actually the reason I did it the other way around though.&nbsp; I was more concerned with keeping the fruiting end at 55F, thus it went in the back and is uninsulated, except for the roof.&nbsp; I didn't want to open the door in the summer and heat up the fruiting area, or in the winter and freeze it.&nbsp; Substrates during colonization are in large filter patch bags and somewhat better protected.&nbsp; <br />In addition, the natural flow of substrate is from my sterilization area/lab which is in the house, so the first room to be entered is where the substrates should go.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'd be walking through the fruiting area every time I brought substrate blocks in to colonize.&nbsp; As for insulation, the incubation area is heavily insulated with Dow styrofoam sheets that are tough enough to be direct buried without collapsing and losing their R factor.&nbsp; It will have an insulated door, and an arctic type entrance with a second door, so hopefully I don't lose too much heat in the winter when I enter and exit.<br />I'm no longer interested in actives.&nbsp; Call it old age. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Mine Shaft?"}}
