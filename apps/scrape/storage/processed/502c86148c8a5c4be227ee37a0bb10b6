Use the cool agar on the receiving dish to cool the scalpel just before the cut.<br /><br />You want the petri dishes open the least amount of time possible.  I follow the 5 second rule.  Never allow a petri dish or jar lid to be open for more than five seconds at any time.  Never have more than one petri dish open at the same time.<br />RR","title":"Re: did i do my agar to agar transfer right?"}}
