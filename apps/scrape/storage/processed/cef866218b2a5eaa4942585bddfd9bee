'Sterilization' is relative and never complete.  It gives us a 'window of opportunity' for our mycelium to capture the substrate.  Toss out the contents of old jars and make up fresh ones for each batch.<br /><br />Dark is overrated.  Normal room lighting has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  Light only becomes a pinning trigger when it's in conjunction with full colonization and an increase in air exchange with a corresponding decrease in CO2 levels.  I've allowed jars to colonize on an open shelf at normal indoor room temperature and normal indoor room lighting for years with no adverse results.<br />RR","title":"Re: Recycling PF jars that never germinated?"}}
