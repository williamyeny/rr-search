Third, there's no nastier piece of equipment in any house than the vacuum cleaner hose, except perhaps the garbage disposal.<br /><br />Get rid of the filter, get rid of the vacuum cleaner, seal those holes and go to work.&nbsp; You won't replace a laminar flow hood with one of those, I promise.&nbsp; We see these and similar ideas posted at least 20 times per year, and every time, the grower uses it once or twice, and then when everything turns green, he listens to those who have been there, done that, and makes a still air box.<br /><br />In addition, look up in a physics book the maximum amount of vacuum that can be pulled in nature. (Answer: It's impossible to lift water in a pipe more than 32 feet vertically, no matter how large the vacuum pump, or how small the pipe diameter.&nbsp; In other words, a jet aircraft engine connected to a drinking straw could not lift a column of water more than 32 feet.)&nbsp; I doubt you'd be able to pull air through that thing.&nbsp; You need to <i>push</i> air through a filter, not pull it.&nbsp; However, the point is mute.&nbsp; Air flow in a glove or still air box is bad news.<br />RR","title":"Re: hepa glove box cheap","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
