The SGFC is meant to be used in rooms that have an RH above %30, anything below and you will run across humidity issues. Temperature can also cause problems. I could not get the humidity to stay consistent in my last project until I placed a small space heater in the room. I suspect that the increase in temperature caused more water to evaporate from the perlite and thusly raised the RH in the FC. Give it a try, it could help.</blockquote><br />Faulty reasoning.&nbsp; A space heater in the room will <b>always</b> lower humidity, not raise it.&nbsp; I'm certain your 'humidity problem' was exactly like 100% of the other members here, which is a <i>made in china <del>hygrometer</del>(piece of crap)</i>, a total waste of money and the leading cause of members trying over and over again to fix what isn't broken.<br />RR","title":"Re: Perlite not all are Created Equal & A Possible Reason Why ur SGFC has Low Humidity"}}
