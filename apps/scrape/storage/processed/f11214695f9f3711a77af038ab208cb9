I get all the nuts to this point with the lid leveled, then tighten opposing nuts maybe a 1/32 of a turn. (This is what I meant by lightly tightening.)&nbsp; I do this all the way around a few times until the nuts are about 1/3 of a turn past the snug point I just mentioned.&nbsp; At this time I can feel that I would have to start using some force to turn them.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's not tight enough.&nbsp; Start over and make them tighter.&nbsp; I have to be careful giving advice because some guys don't know their own strength and will get them so tight, the wingnuts break trying to loosen them. We've even had members put pliers on the wingnuts to get them tighter, and they end up destroying a good unit.<br />RR","title":"Re: \"Breaking in\" new AA pressure cookers","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
