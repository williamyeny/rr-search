I even run a <a href=\"http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">commercial mushroom farm</a> in this dry climate using adapted shotgun terrarium technology with passive air exchange and no humidifiers. Simply mist a few times daily as you're supposed to do and it will work fine.&nbsp; We have lots of members in desert climate zones.<br />RR","title":"Re: The padawan learner's dried-up mycological history in the Mojave Desert."}}
