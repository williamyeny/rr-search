Microwave safe, doesn't mean 'metal to plastic contact in a PC' safe.<br />2. Even the experts sometimes give bad information.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />FACT: Steam at 121C isn't hot enough to melt pp5 containers.&nbsp; Either you bought falsely labeled shit or you're doing something else stupid.&nbsp; Don't blame&nbsp; experienced growers who have never melted plastic in their sterilizers for your fuckups.<br /><br />I've posted over and over and over again that you can't have plastic touching the sides of a pressure cooker IF you're using a gas stove.&nbsp; The reason is that the flame curls around and up the sides.&nbsp; This raises the temperature on the sides of the PC during the warm-up period to well above the temperature it will be after steam is produced.&nbsp; This doesn't happen with electric stoves, only gas.&nbsp; <br /><br />The idea that aluminum foil, one of the most <b>heat conductive</b> materials in the world would suddenly become an <b>'insulator'</b> simply because some idiot wrote a 'tek' and called it such is just dumb.&nbsp; It's even dumber to blame others for your mistake because you think aluminum is an insulator.<br /><br />However, I'm certain no more than 2 weeks will pass before someone else will melt their shit trying to follow a stupid 'tek' and blame others yet again.&nbsp; Use glass jars and proper filters to allow for shaking with grains.<br /><br />I'm seriously thinking of censoring all these stupid teks noobs write by pulling an idea out of their ass and then pretending like it's proved method.&nbsp; All they do is screw up other noobs who follow that instead of something which actually works.<br />RR","title":"Re: Plastic Tek Without Aluminum Foil??","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
