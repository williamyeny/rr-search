The second two I added gypsum and as I said, nothing grew so.... Yea, If it works for others its because your waters ph is high enough that the tbs of gypsum lowers it to optimal conditions for germination. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />You are absolutely incorrect.<br /><br />First of all, gypsum isn't going to alter the pH much, other than to return it to neutral, since it's neutral or nearly so.&nbsp; In addition, mushroom mycelium prefers to germinate and grow at a pH of around 5, so your hypothesis about what went wrong(low pH) is totally off the mark.&nbsp; Furthermore, why would you add something to lower the pH, add gypsum and then raise the pH???&nbsp; It makes no sense whatever.&nbsp; You screwed up somewhere else, but it wasn't the gypsum.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>HybridprX said:</b><br />I personally feel that the tap waters ph that I used was already low and the addition of the gypsum lowered it enough that the spores will not germinate. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />If the pH of the tap water was low, the gypsum would have raised it back towards neutral.&nbsp; I'd suggest some more reading about mineral supplements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the idea expressed earlier that gypsum, a rock that is quarried out of the ground would have fungicides, is ridiculous.<br />RR","title":"Re: Do not add gypsum to cakes!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
