It sounds like bacteria from your description of jelly like film around the grains.<br /><br />The problem wasn't caused by shaking.  The jars were lost already anyway.  Mycelium contaminated by bacteria can be perfectly white, so that's why you didn't see it before.   After a few grows, you learn to recognize the 'melting ice cream' look of a bacteria contaminated jar.  Another indicator is they're often hard to shake.  Non-contaminated mycelium should break up fairly easily when you shake, especially if you bang the jar against a tire or phone book.   However, a grain jar contaminated with bacteria will be like a big blob of rubber when you try to shake it.<br /><br />They'll also smell like garbage, rather than fresh mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain jars failing and stallin"}}
