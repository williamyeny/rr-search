Chanterelles in my area don't fruit until we've had a frost or near frost.  P cyans are another.  You find them in late fall when the temperatures are in the 30's and 40's, after a long summer of 80+ weather.  There's lots more.  <br /><br />Just don't confuse those species with tropical species like cubes.  You can colonize cubes at 80, then move to a fruiting chamber at 85, and they'll go right to town, provided you properly juggle the many pinning triggers simultaneously.  Ditto for pans cyans.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is cold shocking?"}}
