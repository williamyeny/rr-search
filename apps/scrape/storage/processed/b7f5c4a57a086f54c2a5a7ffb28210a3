You don't heat fruiting chambers, and incubators should not be humid at all.  If your incubator is humid, the filter material on your jars will get wet and contaminants can colonize right through wet material.<br /><br />If your house is at normal room temperature where you're comfortable in a t-shirt, you don't need to use an incubator at all.  Simply put your jars on a shelf at room temp.  It's what I've done for years.<br /><br />If you heat a fruiting chamber, condensation will form on the sides and this robs the humidity from the air where your mushrooms need it.  Therefore, it's best to keep the two separate, or as said above, skip the incubator all together.<br />RR","title":"Re: Incubator question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
