Bleach is totally ineffective against fungi mycelium.  I've dipped tissue to be cloned into 50/50 bleach-water and had the mycelium grow just fine.  What bleach will do if sprayed on trichoderma is to turn the green spores white, making one 'think' they've killed the mold.<br /><br />That said, people with severe immune problems such as HIV/AIDS can actually have trichoderma spores germinate and grow inside their lungs, causing serious problems.  Again, it's the spores that are harmful, not the mold itself.  <br /><br />Even oyster mushrooms can cause severe problems from spores.  In fact, I can no longer grow hypsizygus ulmarium because I had a bout of flu while a crop was fruiting, and I was too sick to harvest, so the spores filled my entire room, including my lungs.  I got so sick from those, that to this day, I can't be around that species anymore.  I start wheezing as soon as the spores fall.<br />RR","title":"Re: contam question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
