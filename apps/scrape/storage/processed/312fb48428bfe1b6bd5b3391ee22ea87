Make certain not to start your timer until steam is escaping from under the lid of the pot, and steam for 90 minutes after that time.&nbsp; A common mistake is to start timing when the water boils, and this is incorrect procedure. In fact, I'd call this a trial run, and make up a fresh batch when the time comes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sanitized jars"}}
