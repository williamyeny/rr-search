Remember, alcohol is a sanitizer, NOT a sterilizer. A red hot needle has already been sterilized, so don't compromise it with an alcohol wipe.  Just use the needle while still hot.  The first drop or two of solution will cool the needle allowing the rest to flow cleanly.  The carbon won't hurt anything.  Who cares if the needle is a bit black?<br />RR","title":"Re: Bic vs. Isopro.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
