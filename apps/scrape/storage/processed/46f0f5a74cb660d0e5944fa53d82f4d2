Slicing with a knife carries contaminants from the surface into the middle.  With the virgin territory exposed in the middle of the stone, use a razor sharp scalpel blade to cut a tiny piece out of the center of the stone no larger than a grain of rice.  Place this on agar.  Repeat several times for each dish.  The more clones you take, the better your chances of one of them taking off.  Iodine will help to clean the outside of the stone before you start work, but don't use any on the piece you transfer, and don't use peroxide either.<br /><br />As soon as you see growth, transfer it away from the original petri dish to a new one.  If you see several growths, transfer each to a new dish to grow out.  This way, if mold or bacteria begins to grow, it will get isolated in it's own petri dish to be identified and tossed out later.  Hopefully, one of your dishes will have mushroom mycelium growing from the stone.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fact or urban legend re: philosopher stones from Amsterdam?"}}
