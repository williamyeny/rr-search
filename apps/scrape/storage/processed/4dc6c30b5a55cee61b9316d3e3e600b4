It's colder on the outside of the PC than inside, so water forms on the bottom side of the lid and drips down on your jars or lc during the entire time you're cooking.  That's the reason we cover with foil.<br /><br />The reason lc and agar boil over or otherwise puke out is because guys pop off the weight or relief valve to let the pressure out.  You need to simply shut off the stove when time is up and and walk away, allowing the PC to cool slowly on its own without doing anything to hurry up the process and nothing will boil over.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: PCing polyfilled tubing"}}
