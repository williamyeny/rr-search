RTV silicone is designed for much hotter temps than found in a pressure cooker and it doesn't cure properly, usually peeling off later.<br /><br />Simply use regular silicone, not the high temp RTV. Clear silicone is good for up to 300F, which is well below a pressure cooker temp. You could also put micropore tape over the inoculation holes and simply cover the wound with another piece of micropore tape after injecting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Overwhelmed and afraid of UTFSE (PF related)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
