The PNW summers are too dry for cubes.&nbsp; In the <i>P cubensis</i> native habitat, thunderstorms pop up once a week or so, keeping the mycelium moist.&nbsp; In the PNW, there's often no rain from late May until fall, thus outdoor patches dry up and die if not watered. <br />This picture was taken at the botanical gardens in Seattle.&nbsp; I wonder who could have spawned it there? <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":rolleyes:\" title=\":rolleyes:\"/><br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-40/863121642-Redboy_1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-40/863121642-thumb_Redboy_1a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: PacificNorthWest Strains?"}}
