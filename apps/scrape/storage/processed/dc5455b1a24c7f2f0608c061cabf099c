Full colonization occurs when the mycelium colonizes all the available substrate.  This can be defined as when it runs up against a physical barrier such as the glass jar, the edge of the substrate, or a <i>biological barrier</i> such as a contaminant.<br /><br />I'd just leave it for now and see if the mycelium finishes.  Sometimes it will.<br /><br />Another thing that can cause early pinning is having too large of holes for gas exchange.  Light is only a secondary pinning trigger and not the main one, despite the attention it seems to receive around here.  Full colonization and a reduced CO2 level are the big pinning triggers.<br /><br />Give it another week, and if the mycelium hasn't moved any, go ahead and birth the cake and cut off any uncolonized parts, then dunk and roll.  You can leave the pin or remvove it, your choice.  Sometimes they survive birthing and dunk and roll, other times they abort.  Either way, you'll probably get a good flush later.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Premature Growth","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
