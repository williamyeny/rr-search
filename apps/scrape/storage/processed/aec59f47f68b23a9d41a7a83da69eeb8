It doesn't have to be hermetically sealed.  A still air environment is what you want, and yours would take care of that fine.<br /><br />A puddle on the tyvek in a grain jar is an almost guarantee of contamination.  Under the foil, the condensation would be coming from the grains.  A wet filter with nutes is a perfect path for contaminants to colonize right through the interior of the filter and into your grains.<br /><br />The second mistake was using the knife to scoop out your grains.  Alcohol is not a sterilizer.  You need to break up the grains by banging the jar agaist a fully inflated tire half a dozen times.  Each kernel will separate from each other kernel that way, allowing you to pour from one jar to the other without ever touching the grains with a foreign object.<br />RR","title":"Re: G2G thought it was good but wasnt grr"}}
