You want a terrarium with perlite humidification.  You also don't put the light inside.  It has to be on the outside or it will heat the tub way too hot.  Do a search for my terrarium design with lots of holes drilled in all six sides.  It's self-contained, and if you put it near a window, there's your light source.  If you can't have the terrarium out in the open so it can get proper air exchange and light, then you won't be able to grow.  You've already been preached to, so I'll just give the mechanical info you asked for.<br />RR","title":"Re: Second grow attempt, dorm room stealth, could use some help please!"}}
