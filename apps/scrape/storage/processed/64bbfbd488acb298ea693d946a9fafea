Pasteurization only gives a two to three week window to get it colonized or lose it.  If it was sterilized, it would last longer in the bag, but performance would suffer.  I've pasteurized manure, then three or four days later without use, it already smelled bad. <br /><br />It's easy as pie to pasteurize.  Simply get it to the correct moisture content, then heat so the interior of the manure is at 140F to 160F for an hour.  When it cools, it's ready to use.<br />RR","title":"Re: This is how my hpoo looks after 6 days....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
