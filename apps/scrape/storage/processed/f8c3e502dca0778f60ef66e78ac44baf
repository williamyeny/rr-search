You should be misting several times per day to keep it nice and moist.  You can also pour water right from a bottle between the pins to super-hydrate the casing.   If the substrate is also dry, as I suspect, you can inject water directly into it with a syringe, and/or pour water around the edges of the tray, filling it up.  Pour off the excess a few hours later.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dry casing, Should I dunk?"}}
