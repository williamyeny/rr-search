I mostly ran these tests as an experiment when I was still active on a different board so the information was posted there.  Unfortunately, they don't back up their data before upgrades, so most of that information on my tests got wiped out.  I'm an organic gardener and mushroom grower so don't advocate chemical cures for proper procedure.  Banrot 40_wp is so powerful you can put it in a jar of grains prior to sterilization, then leave it sitting out with the lid off in a dirty room and it won't grow mold, but if you put live mycelium into the jar it will grow unaffected.  However, it's a chemical cure for laziness so I don't recommend it.  Just use proper procedure, then toss out contaminated projects.","title":"Re: Interesting article regarding the fight against the MEAN GREEN"}}
