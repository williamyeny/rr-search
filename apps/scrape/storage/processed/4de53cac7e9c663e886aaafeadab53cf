If you want more potent fruits, pick them as large pins before the veil begins to tear. I keep seeing pictures of large, spore covered fruits posted here, and then they complain about low potency. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: What factors determine potency?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
