If there is turbulence in your glovebox, contamination will get blown off your arms or other surfaces and into the sterile media.<br /><br />However, having some knowledge of HVAC systems, I know they all use a squirrel cage fan to produce pressure.  You never see blade type fans where pressure is required because they cavitate with very little backpressure.  Would you be so kind as to fire up that glovebox and hold a lighter to one of the arm holes?  I would doubt much air comes out, if any.  I've long been of the opinion that no pressure is actually created, therefore the box works as a standard glovebox.  See if your fan can bend a lighter flame over.  I'm curious.  <br /><br />To answer Psychoslut's question, I do know that if you restrict the air, either intake or exhaust on a fan, the load on the motor actually reduces.  This is because less air is being moved, even though it's building pressure.  Less air means less work, therefore less load.  I learned that from an HVAC man when we were both troubleshooting the same unit.(I'm an electrician)  When we fired up the unit, I put an ammeter on the feed, and he opened and closed the dampers to restrict airflow.  Anytime there was restriction, the amp load actually dropped.","title":"Re: My positive pressure Glovebox"}}
