Its just really hard to get down. I got a few stomach pains but not much, I have a solid digestive system though. I never get nausea.. well okay I got nausea from DXM and gaufenesin once but I took like 4 grams of guaf and puked up so bad.<br /></blockquote><br />you know there can be asbestos in vermiculite.&nbsp; not good for you.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />No, there is not asbestos in vermiculite.&nbsp; The one and only mine where that happened was shut down twenty years ago.&nbsp; Besides, asbestos is not a digestive tract toxin, it's a respiratory toxin.<br /><br />The cramps you felt are probably food poisoning.&nbsp; Any jar that didn't colonize in a month is very likely infested with bacteria.&nbsp; As for getting high, I remember all those kids in the sixties getting <i>high</i> when someone sold them oregano for pot 'cause they didn't know the difference. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Slow slow mycelium growth?"}}
