This also happens to be the exact same engineering principal that makes the shotgun terrarium perform so well. <br /><br />The large surface area in contact with the earth also negates the need for any heat or AC.&nbsp; So far, I've observed the grow room over a 80F temperature swing(It's been as hot as 105F outside and as cool so far as 25F) and the internal temp has not even varied by 1 degree.&nbsp; It stays at 58F.&nbsp; I have no reason to suspect that this winter when it's -30, it will change from that same 58F, which is ground temperature at that depth. <br /><br />Don't cut the top layer of substrate off after a flush.<br /><br />Light is required not only for pinning, but for proper mushroom development as well.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium derives energy from light.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown without sufficient lighting are weak, thin and have little weight compared to mushrooms grown with proper lighting.&nbsp; That's why I have over 400 watts of 6500 Kelvin LED lighting in my grow room.&nbsp; It's as bright as daylight in there, and the walls are painted bright white to reflect the light around the room.<br />RR","title":"Re: the importance of light"}}
