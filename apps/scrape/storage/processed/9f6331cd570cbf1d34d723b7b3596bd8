With dairy cows, as with steer manure from feed lots where the animals are packed tightly into small areas, it's extremely important to spread the manure out in the sun for a minimum of a few days to allow all the ammonia from the concentrated urine to evaporate off.  If you forget to do this, it won't work well, if at all.  <br /><br />Cow manure, especially the bagged up stuff you get from nurseries needs to be cut with vermiculite or coir to fluff it up a bit.  It tends to compact.  In fact, horse manure is preferred by growers due to the texture, even though cow/steer manure has more 'nutes'.<br />RR","title":"Re: dairy cow shit or no difference?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
