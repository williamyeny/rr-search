You can do ten grows from the same print and have ten crops that hardly resemble each other, other than being the same species.<br /><br />A fruit grown from multispore inoculation may or may not be an isolated strain.  This is well known in the edible field.  More than one substrain can be present in a single fruit.  That's why clones from mushrooms grown from multispore inoculation do not always form single sector isolates on agar.  I've seen this many times.<br /><br />However, if you isolate down to single sectors on agar, fruits from each single sector isolate will be genetically identical.  However, if you fruit these and take sporeprints, you're back to square one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycology for retards: multispore / clone basics"}}
