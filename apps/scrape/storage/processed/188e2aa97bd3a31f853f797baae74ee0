I've been trying to stop that BS for years, but it keeps getting repeated.  The so-called green molds of mushroom culture are NOT dangerous to humans.<br /><br />However, since you believe that, be sure not to ever eat cheese, and especially don't ever use blue cheese salad dressing, because it has chunks of penicillium mold floating in it.<br /><br />Your fruits are fine.  However, never attempt to cut mold off a cake.  You only spread it when you do.  Trichoderma mycelium is white and unless you're really experienced, you can't tell it from mushroom mycelium.  The correct action is to harvest the fruits, and toss the cake out.  You can bury it into a manure pile in a shady spot outdoors, and it will likely recover, but regardless, there is nothing about having a spot of green on a cake that makes the fruits bad to eat.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mold on fruits??"}}
