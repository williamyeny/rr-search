If you don't, sometimes contaminants will settle on the top verm layer, and then your needle will push them through to the substrate below.<br /><br />Always flame sterilize needles and other tools between jars.  This eliminates the possibility of cross contamination.<br /><br />Wear gloves and wash them with alcohol after putting them on.<br /><br />Wear a surgical mask and don't talk while working.  The spit that leaves your mouth when you talk will easily penetrate even a surgical mask.<br /><br />Work in a small closed room with no drafts.  Use oust to sanitize the air itself, and alcohol or Lysol to sanitize surfaces.<br /><br />As said, get your first few syringes from a reputable source.  With a bit of experience, you'll be making your own in no time.<br /><br />Good luck to you.<br />RR","title":"Re: novice grower. I have green mold. PLEASE HELP","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
