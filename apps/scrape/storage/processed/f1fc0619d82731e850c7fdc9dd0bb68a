I usually don't mention that because I'm on record saying there is no reason whatsoever to use lysol or anything else besides soap and water in a glovebox.  Lysol is a surface disinfectant and you don't dump your agar or clones on the surface of the glovebox anyway.  Just wipe the inside down with soap and water, or even just plain water, then put the lid on with all your stuff inside, wait five minutes for the contaminants that might be in there to settle to the bottom and go to work.  It helps to mist the bottom a bit so any contaminant spores that land on the floor of the glovebox stay there.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar Failure :(","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
