If you cut it too short, it destroys the texture and shape, no longer having thousands of tunnels to hold moisture and/or provide paths for the mycelium.  <br />1\" to 3\" pieces is correct.  If parts are remaining uncolonized, something else is wrong unless you're using a laundry basket tek, in which case the edges never colonize, nor should they.  You want them to dry out.  Misting the parts that stick out will encourage molds to grow on them.  If you stuff the straw into a sleeve as in the straw log teks, it fully colonizes.<br />RR","title":"Re: short straw"}}
