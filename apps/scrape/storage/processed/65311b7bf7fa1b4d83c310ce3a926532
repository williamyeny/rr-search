It's full of holes, and I made the door fit very loose.  I also ran a 4\" clothes dryer hose from the bottom of the greenhouse through the wall to the outside.  This keeps the temp at the very bottom of the greenhouse cooler to stimulate pinning of edibles such as shiitake and portabellos.  I love the setup.  In the summer when it gets hot, I remove the clothes dryer hose to the outside.<br /><br />Yes, the coolmists can withstand the humidity inside the greenhouse just fine.  I have them set up to run for two minutes every fifteen.<br />RR","title":"Re: coolmist?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
