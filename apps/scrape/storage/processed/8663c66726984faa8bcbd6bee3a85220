Bleach is ineffective against molds.  It will kill the spores, but not live molds, so be careful.  It won't do squat for cobweb which spreads by mycelial fragments.  <br />When you bleach bomb, shut OFF all fans and leave the room totally still so the bleach fog can go to work on spores and bacteria.<br />Oust is effective against airborne bacteria.  Lysol is 80% alcohol, so will kill molds, virii and bacteria on surfaces, but is seriously overpriced for a small can of alcohol with only 1/10 of 1% ammonium saccharinate.  <br />The best way I've found to clean a room is to fog with oust or ten percent bleach, then after fifteen minutes, run the flowhood for an hour before starting work.  Doing this, I've been able to leave a petri dish open for several minutes away from the flowhood without introducing contaminants.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about contams"}}
