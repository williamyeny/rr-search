It matters little if a jar is 'colonized' in six days or two weeks, if colonization is merely defined as turning fully white.  What matters is total harvest.

Of course, there are always exceptions, but my experience has been that in the majority of cases, less spores are better.<br />RR","title":"Re: Massive inoculation - would it work?"}}
