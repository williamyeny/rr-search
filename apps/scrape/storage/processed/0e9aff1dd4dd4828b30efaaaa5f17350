Rye grass seed is the most commonly used, but I think that's probably just because it's what stamets happened to use when he did it.  I've gotten larger stones faster with weak coffee hydrated rye berries.  It's also important to use gypsum in each jar or the soak water.  The calcium and supfur both aid sclerotia development.<br /><br />You can get a pretty good harvest 8 weeks after inoculation of spores into rye berries, and if you'll wait three months, a quart jar will produce about 1/2 quart or more of sclerotia.<br /><br />The best bet is to drop your spores onto agar, and then select a good stone producing sector to transfer to grains.  A good strain will begin producing sclerotia on agar within ten days.<br />RR","title":"Re: Curiosity about Mexicana A and Tampanensis"}}
