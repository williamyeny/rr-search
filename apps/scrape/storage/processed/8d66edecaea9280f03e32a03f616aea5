Hang in there and pay double attention to sterile procedures.  Be sure to flame your needle as alcohol does nothing against contaminants on the inside of the needle.  Also, make sure to never draw air into your syringe unless you're in front of a flow hood.  Even a small amount of air will have contaminant spores within.<br /><br />Remember, even in the wintertime, the indoor contaminant spore load can be quite high due to what became trapped in your carpet/curtains/bedding, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green mold, lost everything"}}
