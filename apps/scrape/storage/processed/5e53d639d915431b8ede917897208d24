Just make sure you elevate the jars most of the way out of the water.  You don't want what splashes around during boiling to get past the filters and into your jars.  Don't stop to add water in the middle.  Remember to turn down the heat on the stove when pressure is reached.<br />RR","title":"Re: applying Vaseline to rubber on pc's"}}
