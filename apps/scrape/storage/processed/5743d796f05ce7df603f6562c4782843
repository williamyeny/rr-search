It takes a good soaking, but dactylium is definitely killed by peroxide. A follow up treatment 24 hours later whether you see it returning or not is recommended.<br />You'll need to soak everything including the pins, unfortunately.  When cobweb spores make contact with a mushroom, they germinate and grow quicker than the pin can mature, ruining it.  Early detection is the key.  If found early, it can be spot treated.  If it spreads much at all, the whole casing layer should be sprayed.<br />Cobweb is in the air everywhere(it's called 'powdery mildew' when it gets on houseplants), but will only grow on a casing layer if the air is very still and stale.  Air exchange and mild turbulence within the growing area will prevent it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cobweb!!"}}
