Chop your straw and place it in a pot of water to soak for twelve hours or so.&nbsp; Then, heat the water to between 140F and 160F and hold it there for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br /><br />If you're growing cubensis, you can mix that compost into a bright, but shady spot outdoors.&nbsp; Inoculate with grains or brf cakes.&nbsp; It's not the best to use since cubensis is a primary decomposer, but it will work better than just the cakes by themselves.&nbsp; The best use for that composted manure is to put around your flower beds.<br />RR","title":"Re: cow manure qualities","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
