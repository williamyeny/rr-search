Though, I'd like to improve my english and push it a little further. I'm not at ease with past tenses. I would say :<br />I took<br />I have taken<br />I have had taken<br />I had taken<br /><br />pretty much randomly. I take the one that sounds the best to my ears.<br />I read a whole fucking lot in english, listen to all TV shows and movies in english. Every program and devices I have are set up to english mode. I guess I'll master english one day or another.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />No problem.&nbsp; You're doing great.<br /><br />What pisses me off is people who grew up in the U.S., who speak no other language but 'English', yet they're totally retarded when it comes to forming coherent sentences.&nbsp; I used to correct them, but now I simply ignore their posts because if they can't even master the only language they're ever heard or used, they're also too stupid to grow mushrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />Disregard the rudeness of people who can't recognize a person using a second language to communicate here.<br />RR","title":"Re: Some Items All Noobs Should Know"}}
