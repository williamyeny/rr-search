I have some from the first batch I ever bought, ten years ago.  I still use them after hundreds, if not thousands of times.<br /><br />Next would be to get polyfill from a department store.  It's the white fiber used to fill stuffed animals.  You drill a 3/8\" (.5mm) hole in the lid and stuff it with the polyfill, which acts as a filter.  You can also inject spores or liquid mycelium cultures right through the polyfill.<br /><br />If you don't have tyvek, filter disks, or polyfill, the old standard for years was to stuff a normal cotton ball into the hole in the lid, just as we now use polyfill.  The cotton serves as a filter too, but bear in mind, cotton is organic so must be kept totally dry at all times or contaminats will easily colonize right through it.<br />RR","title":"Re: tyvek replacement for wbs jars"}}
