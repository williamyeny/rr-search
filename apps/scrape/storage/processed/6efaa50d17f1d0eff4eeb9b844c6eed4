You need to raise air exchange drastically after misting for that purpose.  Leave the lid off the terrarium until the pins dry off.<br /><br />High CO2 levels are another thing that causes pins to abort.  Mycelium can form primordia in conditions that can't sustain a flush, so lots of air exchange is very important throughout the fruiting process.<br /><br />If those aren't the causes, weak genetics sometimes will produce flushes that abort.  In that case, just isolate good fruiting strains or roll the dice again with multispore.<br />RR","title":"Re: whats causing my pins to abort?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
