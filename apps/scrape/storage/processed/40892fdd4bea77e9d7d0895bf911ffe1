There was no such thing as nuclear power, airplanes, spacecraft, lasers, etc.&nbsp; Fungi have had far longer to evolve than humans have, so it seems plausible to an open mind that they've found uses for sunlight in ways we humans haven't figured out yet.<br /><br />The bottom line is mushrooms grow bigger, there's more of them, and finished weight is higher when a certain spectrum of light is applied for at least several hours per day.&nbsp; That is an observation I've shared and others have independently reached the same results.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: do i need a light?"}}
