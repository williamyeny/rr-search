If the the bottoms of the jars are black it's from running out of water during sterilization. It seems likely that it was responsible for the jars cracking as well.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yes you do need a spacer with quart jars.&nbsp; The stove burner is over 1000F, and if the jars are in contact with the bottom, and the tops of the jars are 800 degrees cooler, <i>the jars will crack</i>, period.&nbsp; As said above, it may not be the very first cycle, but they will crack and break, usually a ring right around the bottom of the jar.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: broken jars :( oh no!"}}
