The problem with any spent substrate is that not only is the mycelial network weak, but trich and other contaminant spores have already had a few weeks to land on it.  When you use it for spawn, you're also spawning those contaminant spores along with weak mycelium into a fresh substrate.<br /><br />I was not right to say it won't work.  Lots of folks have done it, I know that. What I was saying, and I stick to it, is it won't work well, and for each time you succeed, you'll lose to contaminates at least one.  Each project I do, I try to outdo the previous one. That takes fresh aggressive spawn, with an isolated strain of a proven fruiter. Personally, I'd never waste time trying to spawn with spent substrate, as it's so easy to grow fresh.  Why settle for less than the best?","title":"Re: Using spent cakes as spawn?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
