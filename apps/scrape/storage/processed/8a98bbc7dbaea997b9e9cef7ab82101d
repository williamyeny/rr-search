One thing you can do if you want a thicker substrate is colonize two of them, then at full colonization, turn one upside down and dump out the block on top of the other one and cover with foil for a couple of days to allow the two to knit together.  Then, case and fruit.  I've done that a few times and grown some monsters.  However, I still think your problem is drying out.  Do a dunk and watch them take off.  In addition to a syringe, you can simply pour water down the sides where the substrate has pulled away from the edges.  Pour a cup or so of water there, then an hour later drain off any excess that will pour out.  That should give an overnight boost to your mushrooms.  Of course, if the veils have torn and the caps have flattened out, harvest now because they won't get any bigger.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tiny tiny shrooms and suggestions to repair...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
