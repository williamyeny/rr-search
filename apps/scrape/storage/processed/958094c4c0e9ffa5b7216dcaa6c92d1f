NOTHING inside a glovebox needs to be sterile except what comes into direct contact with your spawn.  I've said for years that alcohol, Lysol, etc., need not be used to clean a glovebox.  Soap and water is sufficient, unless you plan to dump your grains or brf onto the floor of the glovebox, in which case you have a lot of learning to do.<br /><br />The problem working bare armed is that several thousand dead skin cells per hour fall off each arm.  That is a fact of human metabolism. In fact, the overwhelming majority of 'dust' in a house or on the furniture is actually dead skin cells. If you work bare armed, those skin cells that flake off your arms now have a chance to fall by simple gravity into a jar or petri dish.  With a freshly laundered long sleeved shirt, the shirt will catch the majority of those dead skin cells, thus protecting your project.   The shirt does NOT need to be sterile, so please stop confusing the subject with this silly arguing.<br /><br />I also have a box of a thousand tyvek wrist sleeves with elastic at both ends.  As hyphae said, they're a better choice and I concur.  However, most of you don't have those, so a long sleeved, fine weave shirt is the next best choice.  <br /><br />Remember, we as cultivators are the number one vector of contamination, so depending on what you're doing at the time, have a supply of latex gloves, hairnets, surgical(not dust) masks and alcohol, oust and soap and water.  Iodine is excellent as a bactericide.   Always wash your hands and arms, even if you wear gloves and a shirt or tyvek sleeves. Always brush your teeth and use mouthwash just before sterile work, and wash your hair in the shower you take just before beginning work, then use a hairnet in addition to that.<br /><br />If people would just follow those simple things, their contamination problems would be reduced considerably.<br />RR","title":"Re: glove box arm holes"}}
