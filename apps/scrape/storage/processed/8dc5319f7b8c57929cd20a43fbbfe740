Shiitake fruits better after several days in the 50's.   I would avoid keeping it damp all the time.  Take it to the sink and wash the whole block under running water, and then allow it to dry out for a day or two, and then repeat.  If the weather is in the 50's or 60's and raining, be sure to set it outside.<br /><br />Yours looks to be bubbling up well, so it should fruit soon, provided it's had the drop in temps it needs.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shiitake Block","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
