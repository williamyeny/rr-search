That trigger, whatever it is seems to occur later than the time I picked the above pins.  I believe it originates from within the mycelial network itself rather than in individual fruits, because I've cloned a lot of pins like this and also done g2g from jars that were pinning invitro, and never had a pin fail to break down like these did back into extremely aggressive mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cloning Pins Directly to Agar","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
