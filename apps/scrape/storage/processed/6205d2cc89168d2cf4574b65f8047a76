You can run a cool mist, such as the vicks kaz models <b>inside</b> the greenhouse without problems.  I've done so for years and wouldn't recommend something that wasn't safe.  I'm an electrical engineer, as well as licensed journeyman electrician, so am qualified to make that determination.<br /><br />There is no reason to run any other electrical device inside a greenhouse.  The timer(s) should be located outside the greenhouse.  Computer fans are made for computers, which stay dry.  They're not suitable for a high humidity environment the way humidifiers are.<br />RR","title":"Re: humidifier in 100% rh is it safe?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
