I saw a picture of a casing someone let fruit that had trich. the mushrooms looked all twisted and contaminated, I can't imagine it'd be safe to eat them. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />The mushrooms were all twisted up because of lack of air exchange, which is also a leading cause of trichoderma.  Having cobweb, trichoderma, penicillium, etc., does not render the mushrooms unfit to eat.  It DOES however, render the substrate unfit to be in your grow area, so remove contaminated substrates on sight.<br /><br />Cobweb(Dactylium) can easily be treated with 3% peroxide.  Soak the area well and the cobweb will melt on contact.  Repeat twice at 12 hour intervals after that, whether you see the mold return or not.  This works with cobweb, but no other molds.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Bulkie"}}
