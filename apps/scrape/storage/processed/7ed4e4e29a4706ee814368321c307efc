How many humidity threads do you need to simply build a terrarium with three to five inches of well drained perlite in it?  That will provide 99% humidity, provided you drill holes in all six sides as suggested.  I have explained the physics behind it so many times already, I'm not going to type it all over again.<br /><br />Cool mist humidifiers cost from $15 to $35 brand new, and a fraction of that at thrift shops.  If necessary, run one in the room your fruiting chamber is located in.  Right now, the ambient humidity in my house is 11% and my FC is at 98%, using only perlite and 1/4\" holes drilled into all six sides.  I fail to see why you're having so much trouble.<br />RR","title":"Re: low RH in FC?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
