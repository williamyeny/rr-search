It doesn't refer to the tray as if it were a suit<b>case</b>.<br /><br />The reason I feel compelled to correct the improper use of nomenclature is because new growers read the posts to learn, but get horribly confused on what is what when the terms are used incorrectly.<br /><br />The seedling starting trays you pictured above have been used by growers for years to grow mushrooms.  They work fine.<br />RR","title":"Re: Could i case this?"}}
