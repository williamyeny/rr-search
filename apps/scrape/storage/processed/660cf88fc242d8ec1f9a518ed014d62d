I suppose if it's good enough to drink it's good enough for growing unless it has too many minerals in it.<br /><br />I advise against using the microwave on casing.  It will get too hot, partially sterilizing the material rather than pasteurizing, which is selective for beneficial bacteria.  Pasteurizing is done at a much lower temperature over a longer time, so as to preserve the good guys while killing off the mold spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasturizing casing layer question?"}}
