There's nothing wrong with experimenting. It's how we all learn, and how the whole log tek came to be in the first place. . . . .People need to lighten up. I like it when guys experiment and have the courtesy to post their results, good or bad. If someone improves on the straw log tek, my hat is off to them. There's always a better way to do something, but if we never experiment, we never learn. Rock on mr.

Just do it. If you really want to experiment, try something that hasn't already been tried a thousand times. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />I could post a thousand more links, but that's enough.&nbsp; To claim falsely that there's some sort of <b>totalitarian nature</b> here is just plain and simple telling a lie.&nbsp; Nothing is further from the truth. I've always rabidly encouraged experimentation, but what we object to is lazy-asses who argue a point that has been long disproved by tens of thousands of growers, and then tell others to go out and do their research for them.<br /><br />Grow up or go away.&nbsp; This sort of childish paranoia is not welcome here.<br />RR","title":"Re: SGFC - Why wouldn't holes 1\" apart be better than holes 2\" apart?"}}
