Am I missing something?&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br />Temperature drop is not a pinning trigger with tropical species.&nbsp; It seems that you've been reading outdated and/or bad information.&nbsp; Temp drop is a pinning trigger for temperate edible species that fruit in the fall after the cold weather sets in.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>squirrelnutmofia said:</b><br /><br />The only thing I&#65533;ve yet to try is L. G Nicholas suggestion, in his book {Psylocybe Mushroom Handbook}, that I should put the freshly cased grain in the fruiting chamber immediately after being cased. His arguement was that doing so prevents overlay from happening <br /></blockquote><br />Wrong.&nbsp; Overlay is EXTREMELY rare.&nbsp; Too many noobs write books after doing one or two crops and they don't have a clue.&nbsp; In 35 years of growing, I've seen overlay less times than I can count on my fingers, and that's after thousands and thousands of grows.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>squirrelnutmofia said:</b><br />Or could it be that since my temp is usually around 67 degrees that it is just taking longer???<br /></blockquote><br />That's fine.&nbsp; If you can get it up to 75F, it will be a bit faster.<br /><br />Make sure you're not flooding your substrate.&nbsp; In a martha setup, if the mist doesn't absorb into the air, and instead settles on the casing layer, it will saturate it, preventing pinning.&nbsp; Give a few minutes of direct sunlight each day, and replace the incandescent bulb with a fluorescent cool white, or daylight lamp.&nbsp; It takes anywhere from a few days to two weeks to get primordia.&nbsp; Keep the casing layer moist but not wet, and give LOTS of fresh air.&nbsp; Air is the number one pinning trigger because it causes a loss of moisture from the substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pinhead problem","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
