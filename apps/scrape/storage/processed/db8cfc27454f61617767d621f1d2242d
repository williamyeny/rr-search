It smelled just fine when I opened the bag, which surprised me actually.<br /><br />After much experimentation, I've come to the conclusion there really isn't such a thing as 'microwave pasteurization'.  The entire idea with pasteurization is to allow the beneficial bacteria to survive while killing off the mold spores.  This requires a temperature of 140F to 170F for an hour to make sure the molds have been neutralized.  If you go hotter than that, you begin to kill off the beneficial bacteria as well.  The microwave teks I've read on the boards call for several minutes in the microwave, followed by a rest, then several more minutes.  When I do this, the material heats up way beyond the 140F to 170F.  It seems to me this is more of a <i>partial sterlization</i> than actual pasteurization, which needs to be done at much lower temps.  There seems to be a lot of folks using this method, so obviously it works to grow mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tennstud Lifespan? Hmmmm...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
