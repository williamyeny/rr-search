Just inoculate a petri dish and put the test tube back in the refrigerator.  You can split the petri dish into two or three more in a week, and put them in the fridge to use over the next six months, then use the original to inoculate a few quart jars of grains, that you can then do g2g with.<br /><br />You don't replenish the master culture, you replace it.  Just take a small piece of myc and transfer it to a new test tube.  Let it grow until it's mostly grown over the surface, then put it in the refrigerator.  It's best to keep three or four master cultures if you get a super strain.  Even better is to wrap them up well and divide them among several refrigerators in different locations to guard against thieves and/or power failures.<br /><br />Store on a test tube slant or in distilled water, not LC.<br />RR","title":"Re: caring for a master culture"}}
