Bummer.<br /><br />Grains should be incubated at room temperature.  Bacteria and molds are favored at higher than 80F.<br /><br />A leading cause of bacillus in grain jars is a wet filter.  You don't show the top of your jar, but if the filter material is in a position to get wet with grain juice when you shake, that is the likely culprit.  A wet filter, especially if it's wet from grain juice will colonize with bacteria all the way through.  Your filter needs to stay bone dry at all times.  Be sure to use the metal lid first with only two or three 1/16\" holes drilled in it so when you shake, the grain beats against the metal lid and can't get through the very small holes.  Put the filter on the outside of the lid, then screw the metal ring over that.  This method keeps your filter dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: Possible Bacteria Issues With WBS and Rye Quart Jars (Pics Included)"}}
