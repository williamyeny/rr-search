A larger plenum will help to ensure laminar flow. That means your flowhood will be at least 18\" thick.<br /><br />Use a squirrel cage blower.&nbsp; What that 1.4\" of static pressure means is that when they pressurized it(the plenum) to that amount, the flow in cfm was what was stated in the specs, which you didn't post.&nbsp; You can easily operate it at a lower static pressure, but the flow will be lower than stated in the specs.<br /><br />24\" X 24\" is four square feet.&nbsp; In a perfect world with no friction and 100% efficiency, a 400 cubic feet per minute fan(cfm @ 1\" static pressure) would deliver 100 linear feet per minute in air speed leaving the face of the filter, which is what you want.&nbsp; Since we don't live in a perfect world, and no fan is 100% efficient, I'd suggest a blower in the 500-600 cfm range. Make sure it's rated at that cfm @ .8 to 1.4\" of static pressure.&nbsp; Most grainger.com motors are rated at .8\" static pressure.<br /><br />If you get a deal on one that's slightly larger and the flow is too much, you can always block off part of the intake, or even stack two pre-filters together to cut down on the flow.&nbsp; Another option with AC motors is to get a motor speed controller, which can be found online for under $50.&nbsp; However, if you get a motor rated 500 to 600 cfm@.8 static pressure, I can't imagine it flowing too high.&nbsp; It would probably just develop more static pressure, since your filter is so thick.<br /><br />Anno has some good info about flowhoods on <a href=\"http://www.fungifun.org/English/Flowhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">his website</a> that you might want to check out.<br />RR","title":"Re: flowhood filter q's"}}
