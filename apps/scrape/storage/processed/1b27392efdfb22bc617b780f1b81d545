Never cut into it or your knife will push contaminants from the surface into the interior.  Hold the stem with both hands at one end and tear it lengthwise down the center.<br /><br />Use a flame sterilized scalpel or exacto knife to cut a very small chunk no larger than a grain of rice from the freshly exposed interior and transfer that to the petri dish.  Make sure no part of the transfer is from the exterior of the fruit.<br /><br />The transfer will 'look' dead for a few days, then turn fuzzy and start to grow.<br /><br />A milky appearance is bacteria.  Be sure to wear gloves on your hands and a surgical mask.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar Failure :("}}
