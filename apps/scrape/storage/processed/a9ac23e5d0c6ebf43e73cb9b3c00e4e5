However, you need to take pictures with the flash off and a separate light shining from the side at a 45 degree angle so the glare reflects away from the camera lense.  Your spots of mycelium seem to have a distinct edge to them, and that is bad.  It indicates the substrate is contaminated, probably with bacteria.  The leading edge of the mycelium should 'fade' into the substrate, not form a solid line.  A pf jar should also be fully colonized within 21 days, so something is definitely wrong.  Probably your best bet is to bury the jars intact in a small pile of bagged cow manure, or horse manure if you have it.  Do this in a shady spot outdoors.  Very often in natural conditions, the mycelium will recover and fruit.<br />RR","title":"Re: ? for RR regarding Mycelium Culture","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
