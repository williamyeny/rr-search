It just causes such a mass of mycelium you SEE it sooner.  It's a horrible idea by the way because your mycelium spends needless energy combining cells(anastomosis) in order to become a single organism.  You're much better off using a minimum of spores.  Dark syringes or the over use of spores is also a good way to get contaminants.  Remember, more mushroom spores also means more contaminant spores that hitch hike along for the ride.  Since it takes longer for all those strains that germinate to combine, it gives the contaminants a better chance of getting the upper hand.<br />RR","title":"Re: wow! dark syrignes germinate alot faster then the light ones.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
