Use however much lime is necessary to bring the pH to 7 to 7.5  With coir, if you'll use ten percent gypsum, you can skip the lime as the gypsum will help balance the pH to just below 7, which is still fine.  <br /><br />There is no set standard for mixing up substrate.  Every grower plays with mixtures until he's happy with the results.   You can use straight coir, or add in worm castings, coffee grinds, horse manure, cow manure, chicken manure, compost, verm, etc.  You can use all in whatever amount you want except chicken manure, which should be less than 5% of the total.  Mix all the dry ingredients together, then add water until field capacity is reached.  Pasteurize and use.<br />RR","title":"Re: Substrate","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
