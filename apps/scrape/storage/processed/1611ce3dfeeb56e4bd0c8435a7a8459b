For quart or liter jars, I'd suggest 2ml, and squirt it against the glass so it runs down the side.&nbsp; Don't shake afterward.&nbsp; Wait for about 25% colonization and then shake the jar to distribute the colonized grains.&nbsp; After the shake, it should be fully colonized within a week.<br />RR","title":"Re: Filter Disk?????????","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
