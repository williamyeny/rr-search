Sometimes the mushroom mycelium 'over runs' it and the trichoderma is hidden, but still there.  Once it gets a bit of air during spawning, it comes to life with a vengeance.<br /><br />It's important NOT to sterilize bulk subs like coir.  You didn't state your methods, but sterilizing substrates or casing material is a recipe for disaster because the first spore to land on a sterile medium takes off and grows.<br /><br />You need to pH balance your substrates and casing to an initial pH of 8 to 8.5 because trichoderma grows best in a pH of 4 to 6, which is exactly what coir and peat moss are.<br /><br />Cobweb is easy to kill with three sprayings 12 hours apart of 3% peroxide, so it's not really a problem.  Air exchange is the key to preventing both trich and cobweb after first flush, but prior to first flush it requires contaminant free spawn or pf cakes and a proper pH.<br />RR","title":"Re: Endless contamination"}}
