The first step is to wash the grains very well.  Put them in a pot of water and swirl it around, then drain the water out.  Repeat a few times until the water pours off clear.  If you skip this step, your grains will be clumped up and sticking together whether you use gypsum or not.<br /><br />Fill the pot with hot tap water and soak the grains for 24 hours. Add one tablespoon of gypsum for each two gallons of soak water.<br /><br />After 24 hours, bring the pot of water/grain/gypsum to a boil for five minutes.  Drain while still boiling into a strainer and allow to drain well for five minutes.  Shake the collander to toss the grains in the air a bit to let the steam evaporate the moisture off the surface of the grains.  Fill jars 2/3 full, cover with filtered lid and pc for 90 minutes after covering the top of the jar with aluminum foil.  <br /><br />If you'll follow the above instructions, you can leave the PC'd jars in the pressure cooker overnight to cool to room temperature.  When you remove the cold jars and turn them upside down, every single kernel will separate from every other kernel, and they'll flow almost like sand in an hour glass, with absolutely no sticking or clumping.  I'm no fan of micropore tape.  Drill two very small holes of 1mm or 1/16\" in the lid, then use a synthetic filter disk or extra thick(not post office)tyvek. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Gypsum?"}}
