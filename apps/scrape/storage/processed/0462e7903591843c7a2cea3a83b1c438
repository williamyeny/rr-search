Welcome to the shroomery, but this is the sixth brand new thread you've started in the last 40 minutes.  You're asking the basic newbie stuff that is right here on every page if you'll just read.  You need to stop posting and start reading.  You can't just start a new thread for every question.  I'm going to delete the rest.  Read, read, and read some more.  Start with the FAQ and forum guidelines please.  After a few days of reading, feel free to ask about the things you don't understand and folks will be more than willing to help you out.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is tyveck paper used for???"}}
