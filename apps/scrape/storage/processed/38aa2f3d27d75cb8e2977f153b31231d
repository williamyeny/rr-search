You're supposed to put the lid with holes on, then the filter disk or tyvek, then the metal ring, THEN sterilize all together.  I don't know how you're going to get holes cut into the lid without contaminants entering your jar.  If the jar was sterilized without holes, it will have a serious vacuum, which is going to suck air from whereever it is when you open it.   <br /><br />A glovebox is about the best you can hope for at this point.  Who is selling jars without holes cut into the lid anyway?  Lots of guys are having trouble with this lately.  I need to shoot them an email because it's the wrong way to prepare spawn jars.  Anyone selling presterilized jars of grains should have them fitted with a filter prior to sterilization.<br />RR","title":"Re: help with innoclation process with pre-sterlized rye jars for[mediummania]."}}
