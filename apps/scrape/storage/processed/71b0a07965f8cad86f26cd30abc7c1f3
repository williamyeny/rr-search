However, that is way too wet, so there's a possibility if it took too long to colonize, the uncolonized portions may have been overtaken by molds.  It's a waste of time to try to cut molds out of bulk substrates.  I'd suggest burying it into a pile of compost or manure outdoors.  It will probably fruit when conditions improve.<br /><br />When you try to cut 'green' mold out, you only spread it.  The mold mycelium is white.  Only the spores are green.  It's like trying to cut the 'black' spores off your substrate after a flush, as if that is going to remove the mushroom mycelium.  <br />RR","title":"Re: help green mold!"}}
