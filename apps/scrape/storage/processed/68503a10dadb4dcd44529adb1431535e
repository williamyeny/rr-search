Rinse, then drain well before placing three to five inches deep in the terrarium.  Place cakes on a jar lid or foil to keep them separated from the perlite.<br />Drill a bunch of holes in the terrarium for air exchange for while you're at work.  I use a 1/4\" drill bit and drill at least 100 holes on all six sides of my terrariums.  More than that if it's a large one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterile Techniques on the dunk and roll"}}
