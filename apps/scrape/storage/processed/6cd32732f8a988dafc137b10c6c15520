I counted over 70 pins on one cake. Some aborted but on my first flush I was averaging around 40 mature fruits. The problem is that they were so small. One cake, that produced 40+ fruits, weighed a total of 3 dry grams (avg .07 each). </blockquote><br />This is strain related as already said.&nbsp; If you had used a different tek such as a manure or straw bulk substrate, you'd have had thousands of pins and most would still have aborted since a given area of mycelium can only support a given number of fruits to full size.&nbsp; <br />You could probably use that same syringe again and not get the same genetics since every grow from spores is different.&nbsp; Experienced and commercial growers isolate strains to find one with the pinning performance to cover a bulk substrate at about the rate they can fill in a nice canopy without crowding each other out.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: Small Fruits"}}
