That way, you can see colonization begin, quite plainly. They then shake the jar at around 15 to 20% colonization.\"</i><br />Good advice.  The biggest reason to NOT shake right after inoculation is because the germinated spores each send out individual hyphae that must then 'mate' with compatible hyphae before dikaryotic(fertile) mycelium can form.  If you shake right after inoculation with spores, these slow growing hyphae must travel long distances to find a 'partner'.  If you leave them where they are injected, this travel time is much less and you get rapidly growing dikaryons much sooner.   Shake when 30% or so colonized.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about early mycelium growth on rye"}}
