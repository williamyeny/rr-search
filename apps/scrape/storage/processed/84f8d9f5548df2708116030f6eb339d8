You need to remove them as soon as you see them.  Never let them sit in your grow area for even five seconds after you notice the green.  Mist lightly to hold the spores in place, then slip the trays into a plastic garbage bag and seal it up.   Do whatever you want later, but you must remove contaminated projects immediately if you want success on future grows.  Don't forget to shower immediately after handling them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Well there goes $200 and 2 months worth of work... fuck trich"}}
