They're intended for living rooms with mid-range humidity and all they'll read in your terrarium is 8888 or ----- or -HIGH-, etc.  You can get a mechanical one for ten bucks at a cigar shop that can be calibrated.  However, I never use them with perlite in a terrarium.  Just use two to three inches of damp, but not wet perlite and you'll have 98% to 99% humidity.  No need for a hygrometer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Growing problems","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
