Straw fruits best uncased.<br /><br />Never add a casing layer after pinning starts.  It leads to contamination under the casing layer, and also causes the pins that have formed to abort in many cases.<br />RR","title":"Re: Monotub Uncased - Pinning Started today - Can I still add Casing???","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
