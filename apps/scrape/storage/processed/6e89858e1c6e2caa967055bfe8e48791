Green molds such as trichoderma are a fact of life in the commercial mushroom industry, just as with homegrowers.  If you've ever bought mushrooms at the grocery store, chances are you've eaten mushrooms from a casing with green molds.  <br /><br />Those people with a penicillin allergy should learn to recognize that mold.  It's very distinct from trichoderma.<br /><br />Certain types of aspergillis and cladosporium will produce toxic compounds on feed corn that has been in storage for a long period of time. Cattle and dogs have been killed by this mold, and humans can be sickened by eating tortillas that were made with the contaminated corn.   However, these toxins take a year or more to develop, therefore they are not a contaminant of mushroom cultivation with our very short growth cycles. Any corn or other grain we use is properly sterilized before use.<br /><br />The short answer is the green molds will spread and the spores will stick to your walls, clothes, hands, etc., so I recommend tossing any substrate with green out as soon as you find it. This will help to prevent losing future projects when those spores find your next substrate.  Any fruits that are growing on the infected substrate are safe to eat though.  Period.   Make sure the fruits are fresh and not rotten.  If they are rotten, bacteria has started growing and you can get a nasty case of food poisoning from them.<br />RR","title":"Re: actual risk of eating shrooms from a contaminated substrate"}}
