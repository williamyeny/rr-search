If your substrate was at 170F, it's not sterilized.  Many growers, including I believe mr stamets recommends that temperature.  I've just found that a tad lower is better.  Folks need to remember that glass is an insulator.  Just because water is boiling around the glass, doesn't mean it's that hot inside the jar.<br /><br />To answer your other question, the 'mycelium' can be completely white and be contaminated, yes.  If you have bacteria, you'll still have white jars.  Doing the smell test is the best way to know.  I always sniff each and every jar before spawning it into my bulk material.<br />RR","title":"Re: help me figure out why all my tubs are contaminating..."}}
