Many experiments have shown conclusively that fluorescent lamps in the 6500K range produce better pinsets and healthier, meatier fruits than other forms of light.  Stamets himself does not repeat that 'flash of light' triggers pinning nonsense. In fact, he recommends fluorescent lamps in the 6,500 Kelvin range for 12/12 just as I do. In addition, there's a huge difference in saying something can result in 'pins', and helping to trigger a very nice flush.<br /><br />Light, and the intensity/frequency of light is extremely important if one is interested in greater than mediocre performance.  Many species, such as agaricus and P cubensis, can pin in the total absence of light.  That doesn't mean light isn't required for <b>best</b> results, especially with light sensitive species such as P cubensis and P ostreatus.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Benefits of Blue Light"}}
