Therefore there is no such thing as myc piss.  It doesn't matter how many times noobs call it that, it doesn't make it so.<br /><br />Now, look at the yellow that surrounds the red liquid in my picture above.  Note that all that changes is the color.  There is no different kinds of mycelium butted up against each other. The only difference you see is the change in color, thus it's metabolites. If you have mold, you'll have two totally distinct mycelial types forming a line of separation between them.  Use a magnifying glass if necessary to get a closer look.  There's a few 'yellow molds', but usually they leave a 'powdery' type look on the surface.  The yellow is the mold spores.  If your mycelium looks like the above and the only difference is color, then it's metabolites.<br />RR","title":"Re: myc piss or contam??","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
