I routinely pour 140F hot agar over cultures to clean them up from bacterial contamination. They're exposed to this heat for several minutes until the agar cools. The bacteria gets knocked back, but the mycelium recovers in a day or two.<br />Since any colonizing mycelium produces heat on its own, your jar temps probably were over 101.  Your experience is why I recommend room temperature colonization.<br />RR","title":"Re: temp that kills mycelium?"}}
