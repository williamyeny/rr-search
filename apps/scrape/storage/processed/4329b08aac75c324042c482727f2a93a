You'll hear new growers use it a lot around here, but it's incorrect and only serves to confuse other new growers. The word 'casing' is a verb, and refers to the <u>act</u> of placing a <i>casing layer</i>(noun) on top of colonized substrate.<br /><br />You spawn your fully colonized cakes or grains to your bulk substrate material, cover with foil or some other cover to hold CO2 at high levels, but with a few small nail sized holes punched in it so 'some' of the gasses can escape.&nbsp; When fully colonized, you can fruit it uncased by removing the foil cover to allow for a sudden drop in CO2 as fresh air is introduced, or you can apply a casing layer and wait for that to colonize before introducing to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; Peat/verm with gypsum and lime is a good casing layer material should you decide to use one.&nbsp; Coir is a bulk substrate material similar to manure or straw.<br />RR","title":"Re: caisngs: stlil a bit confused...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
