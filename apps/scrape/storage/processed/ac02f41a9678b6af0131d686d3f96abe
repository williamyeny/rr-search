Get the mycelium from the opposite side of the dish to the contaminant.<br /><br />Once you have the mycelium on a new dish, about two to three days later, you'll see the mycelium crawling off the wedge to the new agar.  At this point, transfer a tiny piece of the fresh growth to a new plate.   If you make the second transfer before the mold germinates, you now have a clean culture.  If not, continue doing transfers until you get ahead of the mold.  It's easy to clean up cultures from contamination on agar.<br /><br />You need to wrap your dishes to prevent contaminants getting under the lid.  Remember, any time the air temperature in your room changes, the agar expands and contracts, forcing air in and out of the dish.  This causes contamination if you don't have a gas permeable wrap around the edges such as parafilm.  Some growers use cling wrap with success, but I stick with parafilm.  At any rate, get the edges wrapped.   Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this healthy growth on my agar?"}}
