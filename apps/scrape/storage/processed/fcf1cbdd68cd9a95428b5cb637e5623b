I recommend soap and water to clean a glovebox.  It need not be sterile, and there is no advantage to having it sterile.  A glovebox only needs to have still air so you can open jars or petri dishes and not get contaminants blown into them by the air currents in a normal room.  Even bleach is overkill, but not dangerous the way alcohol based products such as lysol are.  Don't waste your money on anything with a fan or filter.<br />RR","title":"Re: glove box ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
