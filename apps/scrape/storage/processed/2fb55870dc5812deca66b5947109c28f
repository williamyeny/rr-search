Using proper sterile technique and a laminar flow hood, I was still losing about 1 jar out of 20 to bacteria. Sometimes, the whole darn batch would be bad. The filters were intact, so it didn't take long to figure out it was endospores that survived the pressure cooker causing the failures.  A 5% contamination rate is unacceptable, especially when I have less than a 1 jar in 1000 bacterial contamination rate with rye berries.<br /><br />Three or four years ago, there was a 'fad' of using popcorn among growers, with many switching over and trying it.  Fortunately that fad died out after a year or so when people realized how piss poor it is as a spawn medium.   It works, but it works poorly compared to the better choices available at less cost.   I don't know of one single mushroom farm in the world that uses popcorn spawn, and they either have to make a profit or go out of business.<br />RR","title":"Re: wild bird seeds versus wheat berries"}}
