Manure is a bulk substrate, not a spawn.  Manure is also pasteurized, not sterilized, therefore should never be used to spawn to more manure.  Work out your grain issues and stick to that.  Manure to manure transfers have been pulled off, but the failure rate is high.  Don't get greedy and ruin everything.  Just fruit what you have and on the next cycle, start more jars of grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Any reason not to use poo as spawn?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
