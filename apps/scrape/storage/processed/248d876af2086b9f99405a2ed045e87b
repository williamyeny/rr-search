Weighted-gauge pressure canners exhaust tiny<br />amounts of air and steam each time the gauge rocks or<br />jiggles during processing. They control pressure pre-<br />cisely and need neither constant watching nor checking<br />for accuracy during processing. The sound of the weight<br />rocking or jiggling indicates that the canner is maintain-<br />ing the recommended pressure.\"<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The 'jiggling weight' is put there for the retarded so they don't have to watch a gauge, and it also protects them from themselves, because the weight is supposed to release steam to prevent the unit from exploding. They also come with a warning about the maximum BTU the burner can be because too much fire under the PC will prevent the jiggler from releasing enough.&nbsp; The best sterilizers seal up tight and no steam escapes after pressure is reached.<br /><br />Also, every time the weight jiggles, when steam is released from the water within, it's also released from the substrate jars, thus drying them out.&nbsp; There's a huge difference between pressure cooking vegetables and sterilizing grains.&nbsp; You don't use the instructions of the former for the latter.&nbsp; This is why we see so many fails when people buy those cheap ass chinese pressure cookers at walmart.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is wrong with my pressure cooker?"}}
