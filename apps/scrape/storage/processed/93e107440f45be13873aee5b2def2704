The levels will be lower than they would be without holes drilled and/or fanning regularly, but will still be above normal ambient.<br /><br />With oyster mushrooms and lion's mane to name two species that are very CO2 intolerant, you need to fan a few times per day, even when using my terrarium design.<br /><br />The point above, is that even with 100 holes in the floor of the fruiting chamber/terrarium, CO2 levels will still be elevated.  The holes help, but don't make for maintenance free fruiting.  In other words, gravity won't 'drain' the CO2.  I hope this clears up any lingering confusion. <br /><br />In addition, CO2 is not the only reason we provide air exchange.  The other important reason is that contaminants prefer stale air, while mushroom mycelium prefers fresh, moving air.  Good luck to all.<br />RR","title":"Re: Using Gravity for CO2 Removal"}}
