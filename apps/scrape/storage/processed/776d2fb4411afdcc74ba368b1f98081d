The humidifier creates a lot of airflow and turbulence, and this will draw air in and out the vent holes.  Short cycles are much better than long cycles.  I use two to five minutes on, six to ten minutes off depending on ambient humidity at the time.  Use trays of perlite to catch the drips that do fall so they can be returned to the air as humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: CoolMIst INSIDE greenhouse","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
