I have been having some trouble with contams recently. Mostly it's either cobweb mold or green mold. I usually get it while the casing is colonizing. I use Rye berries then I case them to Coir/Verm. I've been updating my methods every time they fail. I use to just use coir/verm but after reading a bit I am going to try a coir/verm/gypsum casing this time. My sterilization method for my rye is just fine. I soak the grains in water for 48 hours that way the endo spores are good and hatched. Then I rinse well & simmer for 10 mins rinse again & then let cool then jar them up into 1qt wide mouth mason jars. My question is for my sterilizing/pasteurizing tek. I want to boil a pot of water for 10 minutes & then add it to my coir brick/verm/gypsum mix & I want to know if that will be enough to keep it from getting contaminated???<br /></blockquote><br /><br />You're doing just about everything wrong, including the temp above 80F that you mentioned in a subsequent post to the one quoted.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Coir/verm is a bulk substrate material, not a casing, although it's often misused as a top layer, and many growers get fruits this way, but not as much as they'd get by placing multiple layers of spawn and coir in the tray.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; NEVER soak grains longer than 24 hours, and that's an outside maximum.&nbsp; Many endospores germinate during the soak and then create more endospores within hours.&nbsp; Soaking 48 hours increases the endospore load exponentially and the PC isn't going to get them all.<br /><br />3. After boiling the grains, don't rinse, and don't let them cool.&nbsp; Drain, allow to dry on the surface, and then place in jars while the grains are still warm.&nbsp; This allows them to reach sterilization temperature in the PC sooner.<br /><br />4. Pouring boiling water on a casing or bulk substrate material is in no way, shape, or form a means of pasteurization. We get dozens of members every week who use that 'method' and get green molds, because the boiling water kills off beneficial microbes which protect the substrate against molds.&nbsp; Bulk substrates and casing mixes should be hydrated to the correct moisture content, and then slowly heated to 140F/60C and kept there for 90 minutes.<br /><br />5. If you're using the coir/verm as a casing material, it should have hydrated lime and gypsum added.&nbsp; If you're using it as a bulk substrate, skip the lime but always use gypsum.<br /><br />6. ALWAYS smell each and every colonized grain jar after shaking to make sure it smells like fresh mushrooms.&nbsp; If it does not, toss it out and don't use as spawn.&nbsp; Generally, when a substrate contaminates prior to full colonization it's the spawn that's at fault, but with all the errors you're making, that may not hold true in this case.<br /><br />7. Bulk substrates should be colonized at normal room temperature.&nbsp; Heating them encourages the molds which improper technique have left intact, and then these molds grow rather than the mushroom mycelium which prefers a cooler temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing bulk mix method"}}
