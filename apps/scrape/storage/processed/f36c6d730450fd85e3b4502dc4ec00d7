Its about trich and I dont feel like making another post.<br /><br />I have one jar out of 45 that has shown a small green/bluish dot about 2cm in diameter. I took it away from the rest of my jars because im about 99% sure thats a contam. Is their any harm in letting it grow though? I wana see how this contam works, how quick it is, just study it a bit so I understand how they act a bit more.<br /><br />Is this risky? Its still inside the jar, sealed up with a dry verm barrier. Its at the innoc point, so apparently it somehow got in when I inoculated (though its near the bottom of the jar).<br /><br />Im just glad its one jar and not more, atleast for now &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />P.S sorry for the thread jack, if you want me to delete my post just ask.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />If you really want to study it then sure go a head its no prob. One tip thoe elastic band a coffee filter or 2 over the top of the jar. It will be contained and safe to study <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/><br /></blockquote><br /><br />No way.&nbsp; Toss it.&nbsp; Trying to stop contaminant spores with coffee filters is like trying to stop a mosquito with a chain link fence.&nbsp; Even with the best synthetic filter disks, I've accidentally missed contaminated jars, and all the surrounding jars come down with trich too.&nbsp; Filters might stop 99.99% of the contaminant spores, but .001% of a few billion is a lot of spores to have floating around.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trich question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
