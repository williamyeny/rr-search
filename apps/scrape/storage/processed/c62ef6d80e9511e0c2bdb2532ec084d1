I've typed this a million times, but here it is again. \"You can eat mushrooms from a moldy substrate\".  If the mold is on the fruits, play it safe and chuck em, but even that isn't always necessary.   If you put blue cheese salad dressing on your lettuce, you're eating mold.<br /><br />If a fruit is rotten from bacteria, it can cause food poisoning, so throw it out.<br /><br />If a fruit looks, smells, and feels normal, it is normal.  Munch away.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question ive never had anwsered..."}}
