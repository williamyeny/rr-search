Having thousands of strains in the same jar may turn it white sooner, but in no way increases performance or yield.  Time is spent combining all those pairings into a coherent whole.  Fewer spores is much better, and in fact the clearest spore syringes often give the most massive flushes.  The reason is that many strains are incompatible, so when you start off with a black syringe, there may be hundreds of incompatible strains at the end, greatly reducing harvest.<br /><br />PF tek is fine for producing small amounts. There is no doubt that grains are much faster to harvest and much more suited for growing larger quantities.  If they weren't, you'd see commercial mushroom farms using the pf tek, which they don't.<br /><br />No flaming in the cult forums please.  We can all disagree and still get along.  Nobody is required to agree with my way, your way, or anybody else's way.<br />RR","title":"Re: WTF flush number 6 with pftek cakes"}}
