You can't boil at 300F without a LOT of pressure.  It doesn't matter how hot your stove is or how rapidly the water is boiling, it will be at 212F/100C.<br /><br />What you're calling a 'casing' is not a casing at all but an uncased bulk substrate.  Forget the verm on bottom.  Layer colonized spawn in alternating layers with your pasteurized horse manure, 1/2\" per layer.  Don't go over 3\" total thickness.  2\" is probably better.  <br /><br />A 'casing' is a non-nutritious top layer that is applied over the fully colonized horse manure in order to supply moisture to the substrate below and to provide an environment suitable for pinning.  a casing layer is optional with cubes.<br /><br />You need to pick up a pressue cooker.  Popcorn and other grains need to be pressure cooked to achieve any degree of success on a regular basis.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question About HORSEPOO casing."}}
