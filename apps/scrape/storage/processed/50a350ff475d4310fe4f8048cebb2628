The bacteria present actually helps or stimulates the mushroom spores to germinate.&nbsp; A second method is that the cows eat the grass where spores have landed and the spores either germinate in the cow's belly, or they are excreted intact and then grow.&nbsp; I've proved this by placing spore prints into water troughs in the PNW which is far outside the natural habitat of cubensis, yet mushrooms appear when the fall rains come.<br /><br />Indoors, we want to maximize our yields to get the most bang for our buck. That's why we've developed methods that far out-perform the wild mushroom fields.&nbsp; You can take one small corner of your bedroom and grow more mushrooms than you could pick on a 100 acre cow pasture.&nbsp; We do it by following techniques that we've developed for the purpose, not trying to mimic nature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Making syringe by placing whole foil print into jar of sterilized water?"}}
