We the cultivators are the number one source of contaminants.  We stir up mold spores when we walk across the floor. Mold spores are on our clothing if we haven't put on freshly washed clothes just before beginning work.  Bacteria flows from our mouths when we breathe, and fills the air with live bacteria if our armpits are sweating.  If we sneeze, up to 200,000 thousand bacteria can be released.  These attach to dust particles in the air and float for a long time.<br /><br />That's why the most successful, long term growers shower, wash hair, brush teeth and use mouthwash, put on freshly washed clothes, wear gloves that are washed with alcohol, masks, hairnets, etc. every time they do sterile work.  Sometimes we can get away with less, but one failed batch of jars, or petri dishes swiped with rare spores can pay for a lot of gloves and toothpaste.<br />RR","title":"Re: CONTAMINATE VECTORS","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
