The cake can only take water if it can expand.  Once it hits the edges of the jar, it can't expand any more, so it stops taking on water.  When you rinse the cake after the dunk, give it a good smell.  If it smells like fresh mushrooms, you're good to go.  It looks ok, but the smell test is more sure.  If it smell like dirt, it's mold.<br /><br />I'm a believer in the verm roll after dunking.  The verm sticks to the cake and serves as a moisture reservoir after you mist, slowly releasing the moisture to the cake.<br />RR","title":"Re: pf cake or ball of mold?"}}
