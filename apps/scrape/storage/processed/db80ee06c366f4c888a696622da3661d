With rye grass seed, I use 1 1/4 cups(300 ml) of grass seed and 5/8 cup(150 ml) of water.<br /><br />Three of the biggest keys to success with rye berries are rinsing the dry grains first to remove the dust and chaff, slow hydration by soaking in warm water(I begin the soak with hot tap water), and making sure the exterior of the grains are dry when loaded into jars.  The only reason I bring the soaked grains to a boil is to get them hot before draining.  The steaming grains evaporate the moisture off their surface, leaving them dry on the outside, while still nice and plump from all the moisture inside.  One could just use a towel to dry off the surface of the rye after soaking, but letting it steam the moisture off is easier in my experience.  While the hot grains are in the collander steaming and draining, it gives me a few minutes to get my jars and lids/filters ready to go.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mex A on rye pissing me off"}}
