In addition, perlite that has been well rinsed, and then drained before placing in a terrarium 5\" deep, will keep it's moisture and provide humidity for well over a month.  This is long enough for a crop cycle.  Between crops, the perlite can be removed and the process repeated.<br /><br />You don't want cotton or any other organic material in your terrarium because they'd grow mold.  You also don't want standing water.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: cotton hill"}}
