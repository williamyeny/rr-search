That's why brighter lights stimulate more pin formation than dim lights.  Many growers apply the casing layer, then immediately place into fruiting conditions, although pinsets are better if you allow it to partially colonize.  <br /><br />In my experience, full colonization of the substrate, an increase in air exchange simultaneous with the naturally occurring drop in CO2 levels that occurs at full colonization, <i>and</i> light are all pinning triggers when growing cubensis or other warm weather tropicals. Timing those three factors is crucial for best results. Personally, I've found no correlation between temperature drop and pinning in these species, although other experienced growers do report such, and of course I respect their knowledge and experience.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing without myc on top"}}
