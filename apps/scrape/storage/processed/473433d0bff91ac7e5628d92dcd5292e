He has searched but he gets conflicting answers. SWIM needs to do this 100% correctly or he's not doing it at all. So my questions are. <br />1. When preparing jars is it better to have the lids rubber side up or down? Should he put tin foil back on after inoculation? Basicly how important is GE, FAE during mycelia colonization?&nbsp; What's the difference between GE and FAE? <br />2. During inoculation SWIM will be poking the needle through an alcohol soaked sponge is flame sterilizing the needle still necessary? He has read on several occasions to not wipe the needle with alcohol after flame sterilizing. <br />3. How long can SWIM store colonized cakes before they go bad, would keeping them in the dark and cold help? Would it kill them to put them in a freezer?<br />4. Is soaking casing, bulk substrate for 24-48 hours before pasteurization an effective method for eliminating badguys?(mold spores, bacteria)<br />5. Is it better to late case? Applying casing after pinning occurs, how should SWIM go about applying the casing so it doesn't damage the pins? Are oyster shells necessary?<br />Sorry for all the questions, SWIM just wants to make sure he does this right the first time. Thank you for your time, any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.</blockquote><br />All your questions are answered in the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek video</a> except for soaking casing, which is not done.&nbsp; Soak straw to hydrate it but not casing material.<br />It sounds like SWIM needs to find a pool or lake to swim in.&nbsp; It's off topic here and needlessly calls attention to yourself.<br />RR","title":"Re: Confused, need answers"}}
