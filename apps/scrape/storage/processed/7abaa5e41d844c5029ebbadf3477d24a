It's just flat-out wrong.&nbsp; Bad info like this causes many new growers to fail, and we need accurate info to help people succeed.&nbsp; Otherwise, we may as well close the site down and let each person figure it all out for himself like we had to do 30 years ago when there were very few books and no internet.<br />RR","title":"Re: Paul Stamets, Endospores, and You"}}
