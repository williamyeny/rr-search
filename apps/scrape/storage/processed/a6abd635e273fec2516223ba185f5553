However, it's counterproductive. You have so many strains active in the same jar that they won't be able to combine by anastomosis into a coherent whole because not all strains are compatible, therefore you'll end up with lots of strains, each one occupying a niche in the substrate.  Fruiting is often delayed by this process.<br /><br />In addition, more spores also means more possible contaminants since very few prints are entirely clean.<br /><br />Of course, the proof will be in the pudding when fruiting time comes.<br /><br />And don't worry about that other guy.  He was just making trouble and kept changing his story with the wind.  Anyway, good luck to you on the project and keep us informed, good or bad.<br />RR","title":"Re: I think this warrants further experimentation..."}}
