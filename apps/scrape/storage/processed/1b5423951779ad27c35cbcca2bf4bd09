Then, dunk prior to first flush to put the moisture for fruiting into them.  <br /><br />I use the fine verm which holds more water per cup then the medium grade verm, but still use the basic 1-1-2 pf recipe.  This makes a drier substrate that colonizes in two weeks.  Give an extra week to consolidate, then birth, dunk and roll.  I see pins regularly 48 hours after birthing this way instead of having the cakes sit there for a week or two.<br />RR","title":"Re: To dunk, or not to dunk"}}
