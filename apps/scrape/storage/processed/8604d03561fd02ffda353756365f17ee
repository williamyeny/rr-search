If the light is needed/ or wanted, how long should it be on for?  thanks peeps!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Introducing to fruiting conditions means you drastically increase air exchange(fanning twice per day is not enough), provide 90% or greater humidity, AND light.   I use 12/12 lighting, but others use less and get good results.  A couple of times getting light while looking isn't going to do squat.  Fluorescent or halogen lamps provide light at the higher end of the spectrum which is better for fruiting than incadescent bulbs which are closer to the low end of the spectrum.  I prefer fluorescent over halogen because they produce far less heat.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flouresent Lighting on Casing to fruit faster?? true or false?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
