The CO2 will not sit in a nice neat layer like sand over the substrate.  The internal heat produced by the mycelium will cause circulation in the jars which will help with the required gas exchange, provided you have a means of escape for the gasses.  As said, leave the holes in the jar lids untaped.<br />RR","title":"Re: air exchange?"}}
