BUT wouldnt this kind of replicate misting and fanning? it would keep sub moist but also promote evaporation when UH is off.....<br /><br />i cant seem to dial in a system where RH is kept high but fog is not present. any ideas or suggestions? really struggling with my current grow, any help would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks everyone<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, toss all that crap out and build a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>.&nbsp; Don't confuse humidity with misting.&nbsp; One can not replace the other.&nbsp; There's no way you're going to properly automate a fruiting chamber, because if you're giving enough fresh air, your substrates will dry out even if you have 99% humidity.<br /><br />You need to use your eyeballs and brain to know when and how much to mist because it's gong to change daily with changes in weather and ambient indoor conditions.&nbsp; Just keep your terrarium in the ballpark for fresh air and humidity, and mist by hand as needed.<br />RR","title":"Re: regulating FC conditions"}}
