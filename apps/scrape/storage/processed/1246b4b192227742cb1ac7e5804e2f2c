We also know that higher intensity light is more effective than lower intensity light.&nbsp; However, its a basic cultivation related subject that has already been covered many, many times before. I've seen nothing new here, but simply a repeat of mostly discredited old information.&nbsp; <br /><br />Talk is cheap, but experimentation isn't.&nbsp; Hopefully, the original poster will learn to grow mushrooms, experiment, and one day will report his findings.<br />RR","title":"Re: Action Spectra and full PDFs! :--)"}}
