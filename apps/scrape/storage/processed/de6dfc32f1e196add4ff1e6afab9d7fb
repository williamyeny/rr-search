What is the best way to indirect spray?</blockquote><br />All developing mushrooms should be sprayed.&nbsp; When pf wrote that tek, he had no previous mushroom growing experience.&nbsp; He built a terrarium out of a fish tank which was totally sealed up, and if you mist mushrooms without providing fresh air, bacteria blooms and they rot.<br />The idea is to provide lots of fresh air which is the number one pinning trigger, and then mist to make up for what evaporates.&nbsp; This understanding is why the pictures of first time grows today blow away the pictures of first time grows from ten to fifteen years ago.&nbsp; Spray when you can.&nbsp; I often work all day and don't touch my terrariums except early morning and evening, and then a spray just before bed.<br />RR","title":"Re: nOOb questions the Shotgun"}}
