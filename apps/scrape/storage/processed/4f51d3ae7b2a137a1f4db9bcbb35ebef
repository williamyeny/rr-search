Just about everyone who has grown cyan/azures reports the side pinning that you see here.  Definitely not a species for new growers.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/08-10/510530742-Ps_cyanescens_002a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/08-10/510530742-thumb_Ps_cyanescens_002a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/08-10/510530751-Ps_cyanescens_003a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/08-10/510530751-thumb_Ps_cyanescens_003a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Indoor psilocybe cyanescen ?"}}
