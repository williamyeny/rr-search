It's the center of the <b>substrate</b> that needs to be at 140F to 160F for an hour, not the water it's sitting in.&nbsp; You need to put a meat thermometer into the center of one of your substrate mixes, and adjust your heat to achieve the above, which is probably what you did, but I wanted to make sure the new growers understood that.<br /><br />I hope you hooked up the green ground wire from your power cord to the metal bucket.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing Bulk for 35$ (Pictorial)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
