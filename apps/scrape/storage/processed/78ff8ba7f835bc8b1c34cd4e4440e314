As the contents shrink during cooling, contaminants can and will be drawn in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm also loathe to open the PC while it's hot just to tighten lids, and besides, shit can get in under the lid while doing that.&nbsp; When I cook grain jars, I can leave them in the PC overnight, or even for a week, and the grains are still loose, so why open the PC while hot?&nbsp; Until they develop a better plastic, I'll stick with tried and true metal lids.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar's Lids.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
