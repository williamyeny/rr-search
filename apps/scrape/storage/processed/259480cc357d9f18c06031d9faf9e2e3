Light should be provided in a normal day/night routine.&nbsp;  The brighter the light the better.&nbsp; Bright light penetrates further into the substrate than dim light.&nbsp; The old adage that 'just a little light will do' is flat out wrong.&nbsp; Bright light is far better.<br />RR","title":"Re: Induce pinning","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
