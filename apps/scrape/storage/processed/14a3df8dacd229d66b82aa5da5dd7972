Get some coir and mix with the steer manure.  Also, toss in your used coffee grinds.  Don't worry about measuring, just use each in whatever proportions you have.  If your nursery has bagged worm castings, toss those in as well.  Mix all to field capacity moisture content and pasteurize at 140F to 170F for an hour.<br /><br />Agar is correct about hay.  Hay is the flat tips that has the grains still in place.  Those grains/seeds will contaminate if you use them in a project.  Straw is the lower stalks that are hollow so they hold moisture, and also straw has no seeds/grains to contaminate.<br />RR","title":"Re: cow manure","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
