The hydroponic guys have them.  The probe type soil PH testers won't work properly in water, so disregard the readings you got.<br /><br />If you got the hi-yield that hc told you about, it is hydrated lime.  Hydrated simply means 'water soluable' so it goes to work right away.  Use at the rate hc said or even a bit more.  If I add one cup to twenty cups of peat, the ph comes out to around 8.1<br /><br />Just remember to only count the peat when figuring the lime, don't count the verm.  It's also much better to mix the dry hydrated lime with the dry peat, then add water.  I also recommend gypsum in your casing mix.  You can use it at up to ten percent of the peat.  Get it at the same garden center you got the lime at.<br />RR","title":"Re: Garden Lime = More Acid No way?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
