Cobweb thrives in stale, still air.  Mushrooms thrive in fresh, moving air.  Here's a simple glovebox for ya.  Just put on latex gloves and stick your arms through the tyvek sleeves and go to work.  Even the tyvek sleeves are optional.  You can just cut the holes and stick your gloved hands through.  You don't need to tape the lid or anything, just put it on after loading.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879888-glove_box_007.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879888-thumb_glove_box_007.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Making a glove box","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
