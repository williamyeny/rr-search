I know someone talked about sulfur and its effects in the advanced section way back. Though its context is beyond me at the moment.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />My well water has hydrogen-sulfide gas which gives it a rotten egg smell.&nbsp; It's caused by a sulfur bacteria that feeds on iron in the water, and it causes the pH to swing way high.&nbsp; I bleach the well out with several gallons of laundry bleach twice per year when it gets to stinking.&nbsp; Yesterday, I checked the pH of my well water and it was 9.&nbsp; Today, after shock-chlorinating(google it) the well, followed by flushing, it's back to pH 6.5 which is perfect.<br /><br />In the US/Canada/Europe and many other 'civilized' areas, tap water is fine to use for everything except long term spore storage. <br /><br />Hard water tends to cause spores to germinate if they're stored in liquid.&nbsp; Water from a softener has a lot of salt in it and that could cause problems. Spring or pond/lake/river water is great, but should be filtered before use.<br />RR","title":"Re: types of water?"}}
