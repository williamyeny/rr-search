Use it on top only.<br /><br />Compost and casing materials should be pasteurized in order to preserve the beneficial bacteria in the peat or compost/manure.  They keep the compost or casing material 'alive' and therefore more resistant to molds.  <br /><br />I recently proved this to myself once again.  I was cooking up a load of rye, but had one tray that needed patching. I was out of pasteurized 50/50, so I mixed some up and put it in a quart jar and pc'd it along with the other nine quarts of rye.  Ten days later, I'm fighting cobweb mold in only one tray out of many, and it's <i>that</i> tray.<br />RR","title":"Re: No longer have a pressure cooker and need to sterilize casing.."}}
