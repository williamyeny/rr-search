My greenhouse is framed with PVC pipe and covered with plastic sheeting. I got all the parts at the hardware store for less than $35. I'd say it's twice to three times the size of the Martha closet.  I didn't put zippers or anything else to seal the door, so it's open on both sides from floor to ceiling.  This provides for plenty of air exchange, and the cool mist humidifiers have no problem keeping the humidity right around 85% to 90%, which is perfect for cased substrates.   When I use it for cakes or straw logs, etc., that require higher humidities, I simply cover them with wax paper which holds in the humidity in that specific area while still fitting loose enough to allow gas/air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions on Coolmist construction","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
