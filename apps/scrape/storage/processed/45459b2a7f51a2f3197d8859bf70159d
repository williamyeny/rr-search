If your humidity is already high, the wax paper is overkill.  I use it in a greenhouse, where I keep the humidity to 80% to prevent water droplets forming and dripping on everything.  The wax paper helps to make up the difference.   If a drop of water does fall from above, the wax paper keeps it from hitting the developing primordia or pins.  Be sure to change it out every couple of days for a fresh sheet.<br /><br />Also, in my post above, I should have said I 'rarely' use a casing with horse manure.  Sometimes I do, and with certain species such as copelandia, a casing layer is mandatory, wax paper or not.<br />RR","title":"Re: Horse Poo, No Casing Layer, Heavily Misted","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
