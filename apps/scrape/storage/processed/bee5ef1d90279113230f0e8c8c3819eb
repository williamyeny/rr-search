Especially if MS is used.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />MS is irrelevant.&nbsp;  I'm somewhat obsessive when it comes to these science projects and I have many years of detailed and meticulous notes on nearly every aspect of every project.&nbsp; So having years worth of data to analyze I have noticed some clear patterns and thus can draw some conclusions.&nbsp; And make no mistake, there is a <u>direct</u> relationship between amount of spawn used and total yield.&nbsp;  And there are very noticeable diminishing returns as you decrease your spawn to bulk ratio.&nbsp;  For instance, if the identical amount of grain spawn was used for 2 tubs, and one was mixed 1:2 and the other 1:8, one tub/substrate would be 3 times size of the other, but it certainly wouldn't produce 3 times the amount of mushrooms, it wouldn't even produce double the amount.&nbsp; Moral of the story:&nbsp; <u>don't skimp on spawn</u>!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It sounds to me like you're saying the moral of the story is it's OK to skimp on spawn, which is correct. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/>&nbsp; Also, multispore <i><u>is relevant</u></i> because you can have dozens of strains fruiting on the same substrate, which screws up the data.<br /><br />I get best results these days with a 1:20 spawn to bulk substrate ratio.&nbsp; Most growers have a hard time with such a low spawn rate, but once you get your sterile procedures down, it's the way to go if maximizing yields is your goal.<br /><br />Also, the term the original poster was looking for is BE, otherwise known as Biological Efficiency.&nbsp; It's the ratio of dry substrate to fresh mushrooms.&nbsp; Any BE of 100% or greater is doing well.<br />RR","title":"Re: whats your input to output ratio doing bulk grains?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
