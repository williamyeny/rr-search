Just before pouring the plates, give it a stir.<br /><br />By the way, you can PC any sealed container, except some plastic bags.  I routinely PC water in jars and also test tubes of agar that are tightly sealed.  They don't blow up.  Pressure inside the jar and outside is the same, therefore there is little to no differential between them.  Just don't do something stupid like pop the weight off the PC at the end of the cycle and you can seal jars just fine.<br /><br />Agar being sterilized for petri dishes in a jar or bottle should get a filtered lid, as I said above.<br />RR","title":"Re: First-timer making petri dishes"}}
