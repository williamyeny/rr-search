You're supposed to spray it until wet three times at 12 hour intervals.&nbsp; Spray until all the cobweb mycelium has 'melted' and disappeared.&nbsp; Repeat twice at 12 and 24 hours after the first spray whether you see any cobweb or not.<br /><br />You also shouldn't be keeping your tray in the dark.&nbsp; Expose to ambient low-level room light from day of inoculation.<br />RR","title":"Re: How manageable is cobweb?"}}
