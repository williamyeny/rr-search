It's an improper use of the term and confusing.  <br /><br />'Casing' is just the layer you put on top of your substrate.  Any mushroom substrate needs near 100% humidity in order to form primordia.  The casing layer provides a humid microclimate by being loosely layed on top of the substrate, thus providing 100% humidity on the surface of the substrate where primordia form.<br /><br />Since cakes, and when you get into edibles, substrate blocks don't have that casing layer, you need to provide 100% humidity by using a misting fog, or a terrarium kept at very high humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidity question"}}
