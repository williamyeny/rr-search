If you keep your house at normal room temperature, there is absolutely no reason to build an incubator.<br />Sure, your jars may colonize three or four days faster at 80F than they will at 70F, but at what cost?<br />At the very least, if you're living in an unheated house during the winter and <i>must</i> use an incubator, fan it out several times daily.&nbsp; Also, you can skip the box and just run a small space heater near the shelf you let jars colonize on, thus negating the effects of CO2 and stale air in a tub.<br />RR","title":"Re: incubator and co2"}}
