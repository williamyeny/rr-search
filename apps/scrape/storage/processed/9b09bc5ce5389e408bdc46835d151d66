There's plenty of genetic diversity within a sporeprint.  Rhizomorphic mycelium is strain, therefore genetic related.  When isolating strains, isolate rhizomorphic sectors.  Not all rhizomorphic sectors will be good producers, but nearly all cottony sectors will be poor producers.<br /><br />Yes, rhizomorphic mycelium is a good sign that the hyphae have mated.
