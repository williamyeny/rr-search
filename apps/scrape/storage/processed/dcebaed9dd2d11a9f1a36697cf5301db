It doesn't get your answers any sooner because most of us who answer the questions only pop in once or twice a day.  I try to read all new posts each time.  It doesn't matter if it's on page one or page five.  Thanks.<br /><br />I've posted a lot about outdoor grows.  Do a few searches.  Each summer, I always take a few jars of spawn to the local botanical gardens.  I've posted fruitings from these park grows a few times, so they should be easy to find.  They're in my gallery if you don't find them through a search.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Outdoor Cultivation! When do I start?"}}
