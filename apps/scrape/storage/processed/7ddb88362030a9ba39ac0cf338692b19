You did go a bit overboard on the amount, so cut it down next time.  There's still a bit of controversy whether the gypsum is actually absorbed into the grains or not, but one thing is certain:  If you soak in water/gypsum, the grains fall apart later like sand in an hour glass.  There will be no clumping of the grains as long as you also got your moisture content right.<br />RR","title":"Re: gypsum + soak water /w rye.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
