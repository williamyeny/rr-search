However, anything from about 15% and above will be fine for your monotubs or shotgun terrariums, etc.<br /><br />Simply mist more to make up for it.&nbsp; This isn't a 'problem' as some new growers report, but the way to get best performance.<br /><br />One last point; those KAZ humidifiers from Vicks used to be OK, but they are next to useless for the last five years or so since they sent production outside the US.&nbsp; You're lucky to get a 5% increase in a small room.&nbsp; They used to give that much increase to a whole house.<br />RR","title":"Re: HUMIDIFIER FOR ROOM! 15x15ft.
