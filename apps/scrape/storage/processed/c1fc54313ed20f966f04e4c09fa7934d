Cut off the female end and strip the wires back.<br /><br />Connect the green wire from your power cord to the chassis(metal parts) of the blower assembly.&nbsp; This wire will take any short circuits directly to ground, tripping the breaker in your house panel and shutting off power if something shorts out.<br /><br />Connect the white wire from your cord to the white on your motor.<br /><br />Insulate all of the colored wires, so none touches any other, and then one at a time, connect them to the black wire of your power cord until you find the speed that bends a lighter flame over 45 degrees from the air exiting your laminar flow hood filter.&nbsp; If you want to get fancy, you can get a rotary switch as shown in the diagram, but it's not necessary.&nbsp; Simply connect directly to the wire that gives the speed you want, and then make sure the rest of the wires are insulated so they can't touch anything else.<br /><br />The brown wires go to your capacitor.&nbsp; What do you mean by 'this part is fucked'?<br />RR","title":"Re: please help, brain hurts, hit with flowhood.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
