With the kernels separated, you can carefully pour the loosened grains from the master to the receiving jar.  Be sure your receiving jars have been prepared no more than 2/3 full, so that you can pour a tablespoon or two worth of grains from the master without overfilling the receiving jar.  No jar should be filled more than 3/4 full after the g2g transfer, because you need room to shake it later.<br /><br />Hopefully, you have a flow hood, but whether you're using a flowhood or glove box, try to get the transfer done within just a few seconds to limit the amount of time the lid is off each receiving jar.  With time and practice you'll develop a technique where you twist the master jar as you pour so the grains will flow out smoothly.  <br /><br />Don't be distracted by the pictures of Paul doing g2g with bare hands.  I cringe everytime I see those.  Wear latex gloves and wipe them down with alcohol after putting them on.  Also, wipe down the exterior of the master and receiving jars with alcohol before the transfer to limit the chances of contaminants from the exterior finding a way inside.<br /><br />I shake the master jar to loosen the kernels, then do the g2g right away.  After the transfer, <i>gently</i> shake the receiving jar, then shake again at 20 to 30 percent colonization.  I never wait for the grains to recover before shaking or g2g.  They'll recover right into the fresh grains of the receivig jar.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: G2G master jar question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
