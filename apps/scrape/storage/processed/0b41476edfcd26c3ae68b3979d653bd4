First, a 'blue' light isn't what you want.  What you want is light that is in the higher frequency end of the spectrum.  Fluorescent lamps have a light temperature of around 5000K, while incadescent bulbs have a light temperature around 3200K.  Perhaps the bluest light you could use would be a metal halide, but that's serious overkill for mushies.  Trash the glowire and use fluorescents.<br /><br />The strawlog tek doesn't call for bleach.  If someone has added that, it was without my knowledge or approval.  The correct lime to use is hydrated lime.<br /><br />It's always best to wait to see pins before birthing.  You should also expose to light from the day of spawning.  The straw will colonize fast, so by giving light the whole time, you'll get one or two early pins, then when you birth, the massive change in gas levels along with full colonization will trigger a great pinset, providing you have a good strain.<br /><br />At this point, just wait.  Make sure it gets plenty of air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: My straw log won't fruit! Help!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
