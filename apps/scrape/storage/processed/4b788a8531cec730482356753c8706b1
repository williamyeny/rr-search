Another poster said they are outdated. Should I just be concerning myself with cloning, agar work, and grain to grain transfers? Am I missing the whole point? I was considering building a magnetic stirrer, but if it's only use is for liquid culture I might as well not waste my time. Any help is greatly appreciated.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Grain to grain transfers are far more secure than liquid culture because you can see and smell if something is wrong before you transfer.<br /><br />Germinate spores on agar so you can isolate away from any contamination before you expand the mycelium.&nbsp; Again, you can't do this with lame-ass LC.<br /><br />Spores will germinate and hyphae will expand much faster on agar than on LC, so any claims that LC is 'faster' is flat-out wrong.&nbsp; Mycelium will also expand exponentially faster on grains than on LC, so again nobody with a modicum of experience can claim LC is faster in any way.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>MaJiK_420 said:</b><br />Now that I got that off my chest, HERES MY 2 CENTS. Take it for what its worth. I just started a liquid culture after coming across a few threads saying how you can make a big batch of LC that last for a while and speeds up colonization times. Sounds good right? Obviously works for some people otherwise nobody would have ever came up with this method. <br /><br />My LC has been colonizing for about two weeks ish. I put 4cc's of spore water into a tablespoon of honey in 200mls H20. I need to search and see if it is ok... or maybe I can just post a pic since it is on topic? without hijacking?<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/13-009/195305206-IMG_2389.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/13-009/195305206-thumb_IMG_2389.jpg\"></a><br />I just give it a little swirl once or twice a day. Not sure about it yet though, like I said need to search more before I try it out.<br /><br />Even if it is all bad... I learned something right? Big deal. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Actually, yes you learned that in two weeks you see <i>nothing</i> in LC, but a grain jar would be fully colonized and ready for grain to grain transfer.&nbsp; Meanwhile, using LC, you wait, and wait and. . . .<br /><br />. . .then when you finally use it, you wait some more to find out if it was contaminated or not so you can start all over again from scratch. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR<br />","title":"Re: Liquid culture a waste of time?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
