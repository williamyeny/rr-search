After making up thousands of jars and doing it both ways, I know which one gives a lower contamination rate.  Having a dry filter is extremely important for it to work properly.  If you put the filter over the lid, and the lid only has four small holes for gas exchange, the filter will be dry.<br /><br />If you leave the foil on, the filter will be damp.  Dust isn't our enemy with grain jars, bacteria is.  A wet filter will allow bacteria that is in the air to colonize right through the filter material.  Gasses will exchange either way, but keeping the filter dry is more important than dust, which is too large to penetrate the filter anyway, provided it's dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: foil on rye jars"}}
