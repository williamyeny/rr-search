If you try to boil it in, the kernels burst.  You can put the grains/gypsum in a jar, then add hot water and soak 24 hours, or do it the way I usually do which is to soak in the kettle I'm going to boil in.   Measuring the grains and water can bite you in the butt because the grains will be at different moisture levels due to the ambient humidity.<br /><br />I'll put it on the list to weigh the stuff someday.  Two things I won't have in my house in this authoritarian country are ziploc bags and a gram scale.  I've had my home raided by law enforcement twice over the years and both times I walked away clear because there was no scale, and no ziploc bags.(no large quantities of illegals either) It seems those two items are some sort of litmus test that tells the bad guys you're dealing or something, so I just avoid them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mex A on rye pissing me off","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
