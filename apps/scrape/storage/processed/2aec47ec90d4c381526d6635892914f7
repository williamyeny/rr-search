The idea was to see if the blades of grass would create air pockets deep into the casing layer that would stimulate pinning.  Results were mixed, but the consensus was it didn't help much and often if the grass got tall and thick, powdery mildew(cobweb mold) would  begin to grow on the grass, ruining the project.<br /><br />Below is mexicana 'a' strain pinning on a casing of grass.  Pretty crappy pinset imo.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-15/339833891-mex_0006a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-15/339833891-thumb_mex_0006a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: grass sprouting from casing","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
