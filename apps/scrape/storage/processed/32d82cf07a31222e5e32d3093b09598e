Thanks!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Since you can't have 'too much' air exchange, I'd just start cutting windows and holes all over the darn thing until your humidification system is unable to keep up, and then simply tape over enough holes so that you can maintain humidity in the upper 90's.  Remember, the more air exchange the better.   Use trays of damp perlite on the floor and on any unused shelf space to help with humidity and also to catch and absorb drips.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help with my greenhouse..?"}}
