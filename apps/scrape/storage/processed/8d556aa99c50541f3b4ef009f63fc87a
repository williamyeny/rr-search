Rip it into thin strips and soak in water.  Woodlovers love it.  The glue doesn't seem to hurt a thing.  The myc gobbles it up first.  I've had good luck using plywood, with the chunky coir mixed in to help fill the gaps.  It helps to add a bit of molassis or brown sugar to the water you soak the wood in.","title":"Re: Woodlovers","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
