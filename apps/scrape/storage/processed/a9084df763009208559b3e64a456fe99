Small jars with damp substrate surrounded by steam don't correlate well with the condenser coil on a refrigeration unit that has 80F air blowing across it.  In addition, steam does cool down as it transfers heat, and that's why the lids of our kettles or pressure cookers rain down condensation during the whole cycle.<br /><br />Follow the pf tek, and you'll have 100% success unless you mess up further down the line.  You steam the jars in a large kettle with a tight fitting lid. They're not supposed to be in the boiling water, but rather on a rack above it. The steam is 100C/212F and after half an hour or so in that steam, the interior of your jars will have reached that same temperature. That's why we steam for 90 minutes.  It allows the center of the jars to be at or near 100C for an hour. Wet brf is not an insulating material.  It's actually an excellent heat conductor.  <br /><br />Don't use alcohol.<br /><br />The people who get contaminated pf cakes would get them whether they pressure cooked or not, becuase they're getting the contamination at inoculation.<br />RR","title":"Re: sterilizing without a pressure cooker","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
