Perlite in a casing mix serves a different purpose.  It creates small air pockets that help to stimulate primordia formation.<br />As said, aluminum pans stimulate side pinning by reflecting light down into the tray.  The mushsroom metabolites also disolve the aluminum.  Use black plastic.<br />However, for your first grow, I'd recommend fruiting the 1/2 pint cakes as cakes in order to learn the mushroom life cycle.  Once you get that part down, experiment with bulk substrates on future grows.<br />Drill several holes in your terrarium, whether you plan to fan or not.  Don't leave it sealed up without air.<br />RR","title":"Re: PF-Tek In Progress Questions!"}}
