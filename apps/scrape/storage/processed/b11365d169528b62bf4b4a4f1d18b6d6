A slightly wadded piece of aluminum foil will also restrict the flow without contaminating, but I'm no fan of restricting the output from a coolmist.  It always seems to help force moisture into the motor bearings, ruining them.  I now use the coomists on a shelf inside the greenhouse, and I've been running the same two for over a year now.  1 minute on, six minutes off gives the perfect humidity with no dripping water.  Air exchange is provided by vents/openings in the greenhouse itself. I use two coolmists, but my PVC framed greenhouse is equal to three or four marthas.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidity question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
