Personally, I like the rinse, soak, simmer, drain and load method although it's more work.  Of course, even with that method, you'll have to experiment a bit.  If your grain comes out too wet or dry, fix whatever is wrong on the next batch.  After a few times, it becomes automatic.  <br /><br />As a side note, preparing your grain jars slightly on the dry side results in a bit faster colonization.  This isn't a problem if you're using them as spawn to bulk substrates, but if you plan to fruit from only the cased grains, performance will suffer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Preparing Rye Grain ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
