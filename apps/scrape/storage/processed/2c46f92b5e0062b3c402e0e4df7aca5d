You need so many dishes to get anywhere, you'll be dropping and breaking the heavy, slippery glass ones, not to mention they are quite expensive.  You can get plastic pre-sterilized dishes for a dime each.  It's hard to justify the effort to clean, wash and re-sterilize the pyrex dishes, then find a way to keep them sterile until time to use, just to save a dime.<br /><br />You can get a box of 500 dishes at <a href=\"http://www.cenmed.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.cenmed.com</a> for $50.  You'll get 25 sleeves of 20 sterile dishes in each sleeve.   Best way to go, imo.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many petri dishes to get?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
