Once a few pins form, the sudden drop in CO2 levels experienced upon removing the plastic will generate a huge pinset.<br /><br />Since you've already birthed the log, keep it at 100% humidity.  Pins should form soon.<br /><br />By the way, straw logs don't require a FC.  You can just use the plastic it was wrapped up in to fold loosely over it to maintain a humidity tent.  This way, they can be used on an open shelf without a greenhouse or FC of any kind.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: straw log care"}}
