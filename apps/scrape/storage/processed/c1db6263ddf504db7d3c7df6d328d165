My question is, since I'm a newbie, after inoculation, do I need to keep the jars in a warm place until they are completely finished? I know to keep them in a dark area, but I was wondering if they should be a little warm.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Room temperature is fine, 75F to 81F is ideal.  There is no reason to keep colonizing jars in darkness.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />When I take the finished cakes from the jars, should I dunk them in spring water like I have heard, or should they do alright without dunking?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Search dunk and roll.  Unless your tap water is contaminated, it works fine.  There is no need or reason to purchase bottled water.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />And, while in the humidity of the Mycodome, what temp. should I keep them at and should I be spraying them with clean spring water to keep them moist every so often?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Try to keep normal room temperature, and near 100% humidity.  Mist as required to keep the verm on the outside of the cake moist.  Three or four light mistings per day are superior to one soaking.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Also about light. I have ecogrow flouros. How much light should I use on them, how close, and is it better to do 18hrs light 6 dark or 12/12? I've read around but I want to make sure from pros like you I do the right thing to my babies.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />12/12 is recommended.  Use fluorescent in the higher end of the spectrum such as 'natural daylight' for best results.  However, good results can come from any fluorescent tube, or even by placing the project near a bright window.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />I chose Cambodian because I heard they grow a lot from my buddy and that they are fairly quick. Please give me some helpful feedback if you can. Thanks guys.<br /></blockquote><br />Strain is irrelevant.  All will work great, since it's the <i>species</i> you're growing.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Simple questions for a beginner","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
