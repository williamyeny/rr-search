I'd put them in the dark when they're about 90% colonized, then when they are at 100%, birth and begin giving them light at that time.  This allows the four major pinning triggers of full colonization, steady rate of evaporation from the substrate, fresh air exchange, <i>and</i> light to all happen at the same time.  Such has been shown to give the best pinsets.  Light does not become a significant pinning trigger until the other factors have also been met.  Many growers dunk at the time of birthing to pump the moisture content up for the first flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: light or no light?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
