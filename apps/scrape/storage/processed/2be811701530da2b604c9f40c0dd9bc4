You definitely want to pour the dishes after the agar has been sterilized, not before.  You can stuff the top of the liquor bottle with polyfill, then cover with foil to prevent contaminants from entering your media while cooling. Personally, I modify a synthetic filter disk to fit inside the original liquor bottle lid, after drilling a 1/4\" hole in the lid, so it can be screwed on tight, then covered with foil. You want to let the agar cool in the bottle until you can handle it without heat protection for your hands. Of course, you still need to wear surgical gloves when you pour.  The reason for letting the agar cool is to avoid the excess condensation that will form in your stack of petri dishes.<br /><br />Mix the MEA powder with cold water.  If you try to mix into warm or hot water, it clumps up just like flour does when making gravy.  Mixing with cold water eliminates that problem.<br /><br />When the agar has solidified, just one or two drops from a spore syringe or a swipe of spores from a print on each dish, or each section if you use divided petri dishes like I do. <br /><br />Don't allow the weight to rattle on your PC while the agar cooks.  If you do, the agar will boil over and make a mess in your PC.  This requires attention to the heat setting on your stove.  As the PC nears pressure, stay ahead of the curve and turn down the setting so you can reach pressure, but not vent excess steam. I use 45 minutes at 15 lbs, not 20 for MEA. After the cycle, make sure the PC cools very slowly to also prevent the agar from boiling over.  I use three or four times as much water in the PC when sterilizing agar as I do with jars for this reason.  The extra thermal mass from using more water holds the heat longer, slowing down the cooling cycle.<br /><br />One last thing.  Be sure to keep your petri dishes in the plastic sleeve they came in right up until you're ready to pour.  I wipe the plastic sleeve down with alcohol before opening.  This is also a good time to wipe your latex gloves with alcohol as well.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation from Syringe: check my procedure."}}
