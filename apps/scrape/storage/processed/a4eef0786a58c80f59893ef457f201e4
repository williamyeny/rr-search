With quart jars you could easily do ten G2G if you did them fast, but that would produce over a truckload of spawn and you probably don't need that much.<br /><br />Another factor to consider is chronological time.&nbsp; If you tried to do three grain to grain transfers a few months apart from each other, senescence would probably set in.&nbsp; One must consider the number of cell divisions as well as the amount of time that has passed.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many generations can u transfer g2g?"}}
