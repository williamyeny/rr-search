You're lucky they're that big.  If you want bigger fruits, use a larger and deeper substrate.<br /><br />All I can see from your grow log is you call them 'casings'.  <i>A casing is a non-nutritious layer placed over the top of the substrate.</i>  Mushrooms may fruit from the casing <i>layer</i>, but the energy comes from the substrate below, which we have no idea what that is other than it came from 19 jars.  If you want larger fruits, you have to spawn to a bulk substrate such as manure or straw, then when that finishes colonization, you apply the casing <i>layer</i>.  It's a misnomer to refer to the whole project as a 'casing'.<br />RR","title":"Re: Great setup - but why first flush always SO TINY! pix"}}
