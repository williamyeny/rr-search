One, it takes water pressure to force the water into the cakes, which the very small amount of water that fits in the jars doesn't provide.  Two, as the cakes draw in water they swell up.  When the cake hits the edge of the glass, it stops swelling, thus stops intaking water.  Three, the swelled up cakes are tighter against the glass, thus harder to birth and can easily get damaged in the process.  <br /><br />You should birth each cake one week after full colonization, then smell to determine if it's good or not, then wash under the faucet with running water, and then soak for 24 hours at the bottom of a large pot.  This will force more water into them.<br />RR","title":"Re: \"dunking\" in jars...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
