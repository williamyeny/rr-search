Just wrap them with parafilm or slip back into the sleeve they came out of and seal it up.  Remember, petri dishes don't seal at all so that gas exchange can take place.  They need to be wrapped or packaged to keep contaminants out.<br /><br />Did you make provisions on the quart jar you prepared the agar in to prevent contaminants entering as it cooled?  Remember, as the PC cools, the contents naturally shrink, so that air from outside is drawn in.  The same thing happens in your jars, so the contaminants have a sneaky way of finding their way into them unless some sort of filtering is provided for.  A filter disk or polyfil/tyvek will usually do the trick.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation from Syringe: check my procedure."}}
