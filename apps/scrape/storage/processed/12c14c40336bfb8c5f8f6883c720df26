However, a quart jar of rye berries will finish colonization within three weeks at 70F, or within ten to 14 days at 84F.  I guess it all depends on how much of a hurry you're in, and we all know this isn't a hobby for the impatient.  In my opinion, the few days to a week you'll gain by using an incubator isn't worth the possibility of overheating and cooking your jars.<br /><br />If you'll start a batch of jars once per week, after a month, you'll have steady flushes, and as long as you start a new batch every week, you'll be picking fruits every week, incubator or not, and you won't be in here posting what to do if your thermostat stuck and your incubator reached 95F.<br /><br />As for bulk subs, I would recommend against any type of incubator as they'll build their own heat during colonization.<br />RR","title":"Re: Incubation really necessary?"}}
