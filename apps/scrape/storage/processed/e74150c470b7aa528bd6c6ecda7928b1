That's an All American, one of the best.<br /><br />Put 1\" of water in the bottom and seal the lid evenly with the wing nuts, turning each one 1/4 turn past snug, so the lid sits evenly.  Do NOT overtighten the nuts.  Put a bit of Vaseline on the beveled sealing edge of the pressure cooker and lid.<br /><br />Turn the stove on HIGH, and allow steam to vent for five minutes with the weight off, or if it's a toggle valve leave the valve open so steam can vent.<br /><br />After the venting period, place the weight on with the '15' position over the nozzle, or if it's a toggle valve, simply close the valve.<br /><br />DON'T LEAVE, but stand there and watch it build pressure.  At 14 PSI, reduce the stove setting to the minimum setting that will allow the PC to maintain 15 PSI.  You'll have to adjust your stove several times.  If the PC leaks, you'll see steam rushing out the spot it leaks from.<br /><br />The next time you use it with loaded jars, you'll find that as the jars cook, you'll need to reduce the heat several times over the first 45 minutes or so of the cooking cycle.  The reason is that as the jars heat up, less heat from the stove is required to maintain pressure.  Once the jars and contents are fully at temperature, you won't need to reduce heat any more, and the pressure will stabilize.  Cook for 1/2 hour beyond this point.  I have one that size and it holds ten 1 quart jars, with 7 standing upright and 3 laying on their sides on top.  I use 90 minutes total at 15 psi.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pressure Canner Questions","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
