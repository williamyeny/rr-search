Wet grains will slow down the mycelium, and then surviving bacteria as a chance to take over.&nbsp; The key is fast colonization.&nbsp; <br /><br />Molds are killed off easily.&nbsp; Bacterial endospores can survive many hours in the PC.&nbsp; Bacteria contamination is caused by surviving endospores, or poor sterile procedure during inoculation.<br /><br />PC for 90 minutes and follow strict sterile procedure.&nbsp; Probably the majority of bacterial 'wet spot' contamination comes from the breath of the cultivator, so flame your needles, etc., and use a glovebox.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain Soak Time, Endospores or hydration?"}}
