Light is horribly over rated as a pinning trigger.  It was most likely the air exchange that was allowed through the landscape fabric.  <br /><br />If you want an awesome pinset, it's important to only allow gas exchange and not air exchange as the mycelium colonizes the substrate.  There's a big difference. During colonization, you actually want CO2 levels to be extremely high, which prevents fruiting. Upon full colonization, you increase FAE (air exchange) and expose to light at the same time.  This results in a sudden and massive pinset.<br />RR","title":"Re: Better Second Flush?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
