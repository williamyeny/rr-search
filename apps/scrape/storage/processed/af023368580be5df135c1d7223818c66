The answer is that when we do grain to grain transfers or other inoculations, we're working with sterile, uncolonized substrate materials and the slightest contaminant spore will take off and grow like crazy.  With fully colonized substrates, they can hold their own.  You can take a fully colonized cake and break it up with your fingers and spawn it to manure.  You can take fully colonized grains, dump them into your hand, and spread them into the bulk substrate without problems.  The difference is colonized vs uncolonized.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"sterile procedure"}}
