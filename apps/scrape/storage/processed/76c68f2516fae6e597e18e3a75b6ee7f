However, it's best to keep it covered with foil over the top while it does.  You want the CO2 levels to build up during colonization, then when you remove the foil at full colonization, the CO2 drops as it gets exposed to light and the other pinning triggers.  Introducing all the pinning triggers at once tends to produce the best pinsets.  Good luck!<br />RR","title":"Re: 21 hours after spawning and coco casing","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
