Those wouldn't fit within the two DVDs, so I elected to leave them out of Let's Grow Mushrooms in order to concentrate on the actual teks for making substrates, casing material, agar work, grain to grain transfers, etc.&nbsp; By only putting the shotgun terrarium tek on the video, it was hoped that any astute grower could apply the shotgun tek to a mini-greenhouse without additional instruction, thus the whole thing could fit on two DVDs.<br /><br />My original intent was to produce a follow-up DVD with the above content on it.&nbsp; However, the cost of professional replication via glass masters, the cover artwork, the disk artwork, and the cost of another UPC code, copyright registration, etc., is simply too high to get ever my money back, when illegal downloaders steal 100 of my videos for every one that gets sold.&nbsp; As I said in the other thread, when that situation changes, I might do it.&nbsp; Until then, those who feed the torrents are serving to keep information and new teks bottled up, rather than spreading knowledge.<br /><br />Thanks for the idea of the paypal donations, but quite frankly I could never accept that.&nbsp; I appreciate the thought, but I'm fiercely independent and believe in the concept of earning a living by the sweat of my brow. I began working on Let's Grow Mushrooms in 2002, and was set back in 2004 for several months when I broke my leg in a backpacking accident.&nbsp; All-in-all, the project took five years of filming, editing, and production before release.&nbsp; If I can't recover the costs honestly, then I'll consider it 'my bad' and move on.<br /><br />If you guys will make high quality, not webcam videos, I could consider hosting them on my site on a discrete page titled 'user videos' and provide the bandwidth needed.&nbsp; I already have two servers, one for the site itself, and another dedicated server for streaming video.&nbsp; However, I would insist that any 'teks' filmed show legal edibles only.<br /><br />As said in the other thread, I'm negotiating with amazon.com for streaming content where the DVD could be downloaded legally, or rented for a 30 day period, but not saved on a computer.&nbsp; If we come to terms, I would be putting disk 1 with the basic growing teks as a separate download from disk 2 with the more advanced teks, so you could get them individually for half the cost.&nbsp; If that works out, I'll be putting up Let's Grow Mushrooms disk 3 with the info on fruiting parameters, contamination, and greenhouse building for online download only.<br /><br />I appreciate the thoughts and the nice comments.<br />RR","title":"Re: Video Tek DVD","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
