(fpm)<br /><br />An 18 X 18 filter has 3 square feet of area.&nbsp; To get 100 fpm, you need a blower that will deliver 300 cfm(cubic feet per minute) at .58\" W.G.&nbsp; Go to grainger.com and find a blower that will give you about half again that amount.&nbsp; I'd look for a blower to deliver around 400 to 500 cfm at .6 to .8 w.g. to make up for friction losses and the drag of the prefilter.&nbsp; You want your finished flowhood to produce about 100 to 125 fpm.<br /><br />The term is 'blower', not pump.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flow Hood Filter Question?
