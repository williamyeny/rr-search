Liquid culture would happen faster. I<br />also feel that most people, in the beginning, use multi spore inoculations.<br /><br />What is your input on these matters?<br /><br />Agar wedges to brown rice flour cakes?<br />How do you inoculate brown rice flour/rice bran cakes with agar wedges?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I can't remember the last time I grew from spores.&nbsp; It's been a long time though.<br /><br />I use agar wedges, and when I use BRF cakes to test isolated strains, I use tyvek or synthetic filter disks, and skip the verm layer.&nbsp; I inoculate in front of a laminar flow hood by lifting the filter and lid up and drop the agar wedge right on top of the brf, and then replace the lid.&nbsp; No shaking.<br /><br />Using a proved strain on agar ensures you're not inoculating with a contaminated syringe.&nbsp; If you're using spore syringes, be sure to spread each syringe out to at least one of each sample in your test.&nbsp; In other words, don't do all the course verm jars with one syringe, fine verm jars with another, etc.<br /><br />You'll probably find somewhat slower colonization with the rice bran vs BRF.&nbsp; The reason is the more nutritious a substrate is, the less the mycelium has to reach out to find food.&nbsp; They'll make up for any slow colonization at fruiting time though. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif\" alt=\":laugh:\" title=\":laugh:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: The Rice Bran As a Cheap Alternative to Brown Rice Flour, vs, Community, Field Research Experiment.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
