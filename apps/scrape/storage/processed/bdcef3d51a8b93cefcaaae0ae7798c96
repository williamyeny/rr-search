Of that, it's easy to draw at least 100ml back out, filling ten syringes from each quart.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe fahtsters tek used pf type jars, but done without a verm barrier.&nbsp; It seems he used tyvek or micropore tape, which allows you to shake easier when you add the water.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: Wickedsick's Mycelium Water TEK","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
