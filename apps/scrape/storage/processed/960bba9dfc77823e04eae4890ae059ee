I generally wait overnight to allow for cooling and draining.&nbsp; If your log is too wet after packing, it means you didn't place a row of holes on the very bottom so it can drain.&nbsp; Water will continue draining for the first three days or so.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Buckeye Oysters said:</b><br />because RR never packs his logs tight.&nbsp; The tighter the more solid and stiff it is and will not bruise when lifted at ends.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Straw logs should be packed VERY tight.&nbsp; The only way one could pack a straw log tighter than I do is to use a hydraulic press.&nbsp; I press straw repeatedly into the log with all my weight, as well as lifting the log and dropping it on its end to further pack. After packing, the end of the plastic is twisted, which packs the log even tighter. This is clearly shown in \"Let's Grow Mushrooms\".<br /><br />I wouldn't use alfalfa in a straw log.&nbsp; It's full of weed and other seeds, which are essentially non-colonized grains.&nbsp; If you want to use hay, then use filter patch bags and sterilize it, not straw logs.<br />RR","title":"Re: Straw dryness for straw log projects with alfalfa.
