I am going to move my terrarium to my closet and basically build it a small dark area with a led lamp indirectly supplying light in the area, but I think the way for me to get consistent 10-12 or less hours of light will be to have the lamp on at night and off during the day. Is this a bad idea? Should I just save myself some time and be patient with the current setup?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Bad idea.<br />Closets are horrible places to grow due to lack of fresh air.&nbsp; Keep your terrarium in bright light during daylight hours.&nbsp; The exact timing isn't as critical as with plants, but see to it they get a few hours of bright light(even a few minutes of direct sunlight is good) and the rest of the time they'll be fine with just your room light.&nbsp; If you need extra, get a clamp-on fixture and screw a daylight/6500K CFL into it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Still Unclear On Lighting","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
