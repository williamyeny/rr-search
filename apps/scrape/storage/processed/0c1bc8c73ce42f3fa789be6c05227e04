For water, you want the glass bulb type, and they make special calibration solutions.  For soil, Agar had a probe he trusted, but I don't know where he got it.  All the soil probes I've found are extremely inaccurate with sterile or pasteurized media.  I recommend squeezing a bit of water out of the compost or casing mix, then using a paper test strip.  Once you figure out how much lime to use, just use that amount every time.  I haven't needed to test ph in at least two years, so no need to buy an expensive tester.<br />RR","title":"Re: How do you Test a PH Probe?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
