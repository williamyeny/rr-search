These questions have been answered repeatedly in the last few weeks, as they were last year at this time, and the year before that, and every spring since the board has been here.  They are available on the search or by simply using the page buttons at the bottom of the page to scroll back.  Nobody wants to type several paragraphs of the same exact answer over and over again daily for those who don't want to help themselves.<br /><br />If you'll use the 'search posts' feature at the top of the page, type in 'gnats' as the search term, and my username, and you'll find 36 separate threads where I've shared my experiences dealing with them.  If you leave the username field blank, you'll get a few hundred threads dealing with gnats.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tiny \"Fruit Flies\" - - Do they bother? - - Can I control with pyrethrum"}}
