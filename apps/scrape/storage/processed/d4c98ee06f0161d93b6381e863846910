You can sterilize or pasteurize the casing and it will work, or leave the casing off completely and cubensis will still fruit.<br /><br />However, when you move to edibles such as agaricus and shaggy manes, they won't fruit at all if you sterilize, and shaggy manes won't even fruit on pasteurized casing material.  It has to be mixed up and used as is with no heat treatment.  With most species though, the beneficial bacteria that survive pasteurization will help protect the casing layer from contaminants by keeping it 'alive'.  A sterilized substrate or casing will allow whatever lands on it to grow.<br />RR","title":"Re: looked around can't find.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
