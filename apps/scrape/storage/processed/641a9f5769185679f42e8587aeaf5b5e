(use a good prefilter)<br /><br />The motor specs you posted above are not sufficient to operate this filter.<br /><br />Build the flow hood, leaving at least 8\" of free space behind the filter.&nbsp; This is the plenum where air from the blower will pressurize, thus placing an equal amount of air over the entire back surface of the filter.&nbsp; This helps to achieve laminar flow out the front.<br /><br />You want about 450 to 500 cfm(cubic feet per minute, a measure of volume) blowing through the filter to get a speed of 100 to 125 fpm(feet per minute, a measure of air speed).&nbsp; I suspect with that filter, you'll achieve the desired flow with a resistance of around .5 or so.&nbsp; Find a 500 cfm blower at .5\" to .7\" W.G.<br /><br />Place a lighter 2\" away from the face of the filter.&nbsp; It should bend over about 45 to 60 degrees, but not flicker or go out. It should also blow over the same amount no matter where around the face the filter you place it.&nbsp; If there is too much flow, simply stack a couple of prefilters together to throttle it down or otherwise block off part of the intake.<br />RR","title":"Re: who wants a flowhood?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
