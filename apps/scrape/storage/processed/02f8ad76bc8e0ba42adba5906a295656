Saturate the casing layer very well.  It will kill the cobweb, then the peroxide breaks down rapidly in the presence of organic material.  I've noticed no harm to future flushes by using this tek.  Just remember to increase the air exchange or the cobweb will come right back.  Cobweb only thrives in still, stale air.
