In other words, leached coffee grinds.  Do not use instant or liquid coffee in substrates.  Mix coffee in any percentage you want.  I've grown on pure coffee. The more items you mix into the substrate, the better.  If you have manure, coir, worm castings, compost, coffee grinds, straw, etc., use a little of all of them.  Add up to ten percent by volume of gypsum and mix all the dry ingredients.  Then, add water to field capacity and pasteurize.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coffee + Coir?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
