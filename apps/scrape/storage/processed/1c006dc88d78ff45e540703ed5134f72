You can see it best in the last picture.  Anytime you have two distinct colors/types of growth, at least one of them is mold. The third jar shows it very clearly.<br /><br />The second jar looks to have green mold in the bottom, but it could be a reflection from the camera flash.<br /><br />They should have been fully colonized within two two three weeks tops, so something is bad wrong. Make up a new batch and try again.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: myc piss or mold?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
