Something is wrong.  If the holes for gas exchange are open, I'd suspect bacterial contaminationl, in which case toss them out.  If the holes are taped or otherwise shut, open them right away and/or turn them upside down as said.   You didn't say what type 'jars', but bear in mind, pf jars with the verm barrier can cause problems turning upside down if it disturbs the vermiculite barrier.
