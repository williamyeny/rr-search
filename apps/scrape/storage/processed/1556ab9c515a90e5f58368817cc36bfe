Your pot will have to be able to dissipate that much heat or burn up.  A 100 ohm rheostat should be able to give full speed control, provided you find one rated 4 watts or above.  Don't use the motor speed controller I linked to above on a DC motor.   You could probably run it on a 6 volt battery charger to get half speed.<br />RR","title":"Re: speed controller for lc magnetic stirrer","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
