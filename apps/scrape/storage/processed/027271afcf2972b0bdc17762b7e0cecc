Once pins are set, humidity can be reduced a bit, but don't get out of the 90's. The 'old' advice of keeping humidity lower for cased substrates is incorrect.  As hyphae said, keep humidity high, and air exchange high. <br /><br />PE's don't pin well unless you do strain isolations and find a really good fruiting isolate.  What you have is about average pinset for multispore inoculation.<br />RR","title":"Re: dang penises of envy"}}
