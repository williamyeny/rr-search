It would be much easier. It appears that gently prodding, followed by progressively not-so-gently prodding doesn't seem to be working. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mad2.gif\" alt=\":mad2:\" title=\":mad2:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Moderators who insult members!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
