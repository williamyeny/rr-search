Then the mycelium gets a head start on competitors when the coated disclets get dropped into the LC.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />What you're missing is the cardboard won't be sterile and LC must be.&nbsp; In addition, it's a myth that cube spores germinate well on cardboard.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; Even if they did germinate on cardboard, the mycelium would only be on the surface, not permeating the whole piece.&nbsp; In addition, mold loves cardboard.&nbsp; Ever leave a box out in a damp shed?&nbsp; If so, it was covered in black mold.<br /><br />I'd suggest following established teks and later on with more experience, experiment all you want.&nbsp; If you went two weeks with no activity on brf cakes, then either the procedure or your spores were bunk.&nbsp; Normally, they're fully colonized in two to three weeks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Calling for comments on this outline plan ..."}}
