More than a few minutes at a time will cause drips to form.  I run mine less than five minutes on, followed by five to ten minutes off.  This maintains a high humidity without excessive dripping.  You need to seal the bottom and put several trays of perlite down there to catch whatever drips do form.  <br /><br />At the very least, get a timer with 15 minute intervals.  They're cheap.  Try running 15 on, 30 off.<br />RR","title":"Re: Water Logged Martha"}}
