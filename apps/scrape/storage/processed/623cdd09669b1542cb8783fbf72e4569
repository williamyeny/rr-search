Birth the cakes.  Wash under the faucet to remove the loose parts of the verm barrier, but don't worry about the parts that are colonized.  Soak under water in a large pot 24 hours.  Use whatever you have to hold them under water so they don't float.  Rinse again after the soak, then roll in dry verm.  Place in terrarium, and an hour later mist well to get the dry verm nice and damp.<br />RR","title":"Re: Almost fully colonized...now what?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
