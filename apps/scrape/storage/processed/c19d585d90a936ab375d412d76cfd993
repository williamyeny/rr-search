Light is required to initiate pinning.  While the light you use to look at it every day might help trigger a pin or two, if you want a real pinset like you see in the pictures here, expose your mycelia to light.  I expose to light from the day the spores are germinated on agar.  As for the casing, it depends on the strain, and if you have a good fruiting substrain or not.
