The ambient humidity obviously is not very high so hopefully this will provide some of the constant evaporating action from the top of the substrate to induce pinning. Any comments? Good idea bad idea?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Any feedback on this method?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Sounds like a recipe for molds.&nbsp; You don't want polyfill in the holes at all once you start fruiting.&nbsp; Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger and you can't get fresh air through polyfill or any other filter for that matter.&nbsp; In addition, you don't want your humidity to drop below 90% ever.&nbsp; Still air and/or stale air is a major risk factor for molds, which favor those conditions.&nbsp; Mushrooms like fresh air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Damn it... still no pins and now this.
