Don't inject a casing layer.  All you need to do is mist.  If the substrate below is too dry, you can inject a bit of water into it.  There is no need for sterile water or peroxide.<br /><br />Why are there three active threads asking this same question?  You guys really need to read several pages of threads before starting one of your own.  It clutters the boards up to have multiple threads all over the place asking the exact same questions that have already been answered.<br />RR","title":"Re: injecting a bulk substrate (castings/verm) to increase humidity","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
