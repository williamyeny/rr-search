They are already 2/3 vermiculite when you make them, and the casing layer adds no food for the mycelium.  Dunk and roll is superior to crumbling and casing because it produces fruits just as large, and produces them a week to ten day sooner because the cakes don't have to recover from the damage caused by breaking them up.<br /><br />2) NEVER attempt to use a cake or other spawn that is not 100% colonized PLUS one week.  The mycelium needs a week to consolidate its hold on the substrate.  You greatly increase the chances of contamination and/or failure by not following the above.<br /><br />3) Using massive amounts of spore solution is counter productive.  You generate so many strains by doing so, that not all of them are able to consolidate into a single organism via anastomosis.  Therefore your cakes end up having more than one strain at fruiting time, and not all strains are fruiting strains.  While the jar may turn 'white' sooner by using massive spore inoculation, performance suffers.  The minimum amount of spores is the correct amount, as you're more assured of good performance at fruiting time.   In addition, since no print is 100% clean, using massive amounts of spores also injects more contaminants into the substrate at the same time.  It's like playing Russian roulette, except with two bullets in the chamber instead of just one.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing question!"}}
