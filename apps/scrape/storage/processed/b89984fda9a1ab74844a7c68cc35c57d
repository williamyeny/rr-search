It doesn't matter if mold spores enter the mini greenhouse/fruiting chamber or not.&nbsp; The mushroom mycelium will eat them for lunch.&nbsp; Many new growers do not realize this, and thus they contaminate their own projects repeatedly, by trying to adapt filtering methods for spawn jars to the growing environment.<br /><br />My mini-greenhouse has slits cut from floor to ceiling in several places.&nbsp; The more air entering and exiting the better.&nbsp; I run two cool mist humidifiers inside the greenhouse, and these produce plenty of moisture and also swirl the air around inside since there's no tubes or hoses to limit flow.&nbsp; Remember: moving, turbulent fresh air is a pinning trigger for mushrooms and a death blow for molds.<br />RR","title":"Re: Martha cool mist back pressure"}}
