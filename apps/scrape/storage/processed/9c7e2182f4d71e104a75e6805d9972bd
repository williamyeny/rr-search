Two years is nothing.  The Redboy strain was brought back from 20 year old spores.  After four or five years, many spores will start to collapse, but some will still germinate.  After that, it becomes luck and/or the skill of the print taker as well as the quality of storage.<br /><br />Two year old spores will work fine if placed on agar and isolated away from the contaminants.  It doesn't matter how many people have touched or breathed on it.  If you're not up to agar work, continue on the path to getting a new, clean print.  I'm sure otto can hook you up.<br />RR","title":"Re: spores in Oz"}}
