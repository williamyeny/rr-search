This is what makes a shotgun terrarium function as opposed to the often-repeated but incorrect assumption that CO2 'drains out' the bottom.(which it does not)<br /><br />The bottom line is the lower density of humid air(which causes it to rise) and the rising warm air overcomes the extra weight of the CO2 laden air, carrying it along(and upwards) for the ride.<br />RR","title":"Re: Curious about factors governing height."}}
