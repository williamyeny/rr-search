I advise against wiping the needles with anything.&nbsp; You can't get cleaner than 'red-hot'.<br /><br />If the whole jars are green, your sterilization process didn't work. If the green is only at the inoculation sites, then your inoculation procedure or syringe itself is the problem. Use a simple kettle to boil as per the video, or use a pressure cooker properly.<br /><br />Consider a glovebox a must.&nbsp; It isn't necessary to use lysol or anything else in a glovebox.&nbsp; Gloveboxes are only a means of stopping air currents in the room, nothing else.<br /><br />I'd discard the used syringe and use your new one.&nbsp; Since you didn't use a glovebox, there's a chance that room air got sucked into the syringe, so why take a chance?<br /><br />The same videos that are on youtube are also on my website, but in much higher resolution, provided you have high speed internet service.&nbsp; There's also text that fills in some of the questions that can't be easily covered in video format.&nbsp; Read the brf tek page and the terrarium tek page.&nbsp; The link is in my signature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Some questions after first attempt and failure"}}
