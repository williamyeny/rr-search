I don't wear wool either. No one, animal or human kind (is there even a difference?) is coming up to me and shaving my back or skinning my hide for warmth.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Interesting philosophy.&nbsp; I take it you don't have a job?&nbsp; Because if you do, your boss is skinning your hide and giving you a penance to keep you alive to come back to work tomorrow.&nbsp; I treat my bees better than that.<br /><br />For the record, the hive is benefited from taking some of the honey and wax out.&nbsp; I don't use 'standard' frames any more, where you extract the honey and put the frame with comb back in for them to refill.&nbsp; Doing so leads to colony collapse disorder and other problems because the comb absorbs toxins which slowly build up and kill the bees.&nbsp; When you let them build their own comb on wires, you remove it when you harvest the honey, preventing that buildup.<br /><br />I'm assuming you don't eat fruits and vegetables either?&nbsp; If you do, please consider the trauma caused to microbes in the soil when their home is destroyed by picking the crops. Think of the poor birds and worms who won't get to munch those strawberries if you eat them instead. If you think shaving wool is bad for the sheep, imagine what ripping a carrot out of the ground does to the poor grub worms who are just as much a part of nature as humans and cows. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Vegan Product for Sealing Plug Spawn?"}}
