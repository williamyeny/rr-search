It's wierd, growing under the agar on the bottom of the plate.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />This is from exposure with the lids off prior to pouring, allowing contaminants to settle on the empty petri dish.<br /><br />That being said, most of what I see above appears to simply be undissolved solids from your nutrients.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bacteria or ","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
