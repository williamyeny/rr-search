That is a very simple matter of physics. 15 psi equates to 250F, and water turns to steam at 212F.  If you release pressure, the moisture in the jars which is also at 250F can no longer remain in the liquid state, and therefore turns to steam and escapes until the temperature of the jar drops below 212F/100C.  This can also damage your filter material, so don't ever do it.  It is wrong, period.<br /><br />Grains clumped up are mainly a sign of improper or no rinsing before cooking, and/or the failure to add gypsum.  If you rinse the grains properly before the cycle, and add a pinch of gypsum either to the soak water or to each jar, the grains will separate from each other like sand in an hourglass.  Good luck to you.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye Question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
