You should mix the water and verm very well, and then add the brown rice flour slowly, then stir until it's a homogenized mix.  <br />Light has absolutely zero effect on colonizing mycelium.  I allow jars to colonize on an open shelf in a well lit room.<br />Washed hands are fine for handling jars that are colonizing.<br />Your spores did not germinate after three hours.  Either that's rice flour that was not mixed in properly, or it's bacteria contamination.  If it has a greasy look, that's what bacteria looks like.  Cobweb mold is not a contaminant of jar cultures.<br />Cubes will fruit fine at 80F<br />As said, the reason for dunking in the refrigerator is only to slow down bacteria growth during the dunk.  If you don't wish to use the refrigerator, rinse the cakes well under the faucet before the dunk, and then change the water at 8 hour intervals, rinsing the cakes each time.  Dunk for 24 hours, then roll in dry vermiculite.  Get the verm to stick to all surfaces of the cakes, and then mist well several times over the first few hours after you place them in the terrarium, in order to moisten the verm.<br />Don't set cakes on perlite. They will waterlog that way.  Set them on a jar lid, or piece of foil to keep them away from the perlite.  My experience is that breaking up pf cakes to case is a waste.  They rarely perform better than fruiting them as cakes and fruiting is delayed for two weeks.<br />Allow them to remain in the jars for one full week past full colonization before birthing-dunk and roll.<br />Be sure to provide plenty of air exchange and keep your humidity at 99% during fruiting.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: A few questions for my first grow."}}
