They like a mix of wood.  I've even seen large fruitings on Douglas fir.  Make sure you have a few nice sized pieces of wood in there, because they tend to produce the best fruits.  Sawdust mixed with a bit of soil will help fill in the gaps around the chips.  Try not to keep them too wet, or mold will be a problem.  I let mine dry out quite a bit before watering.<br />RR","title":"Re: indoor/outdoor cyanescen project"}}
