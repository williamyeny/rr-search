I've seen no evidence that psilocybin breaks down at 100C/212F, and after many batches of tea where the end product was much more effective than eating raw mushrooms, I'm convinced otherwise.  <br /><br />It's a well known fact that the nutritional value of edible mushrooms is only fully realized upon cooking, so why would psilocybe mushrooms be any different?  The real-world experiences of thousands of growers who have boiled their product into tea speaks for itself.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sudden wave of paranoia-put my mind at ease (did I dry them to death?)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
