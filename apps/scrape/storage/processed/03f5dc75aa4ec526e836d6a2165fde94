If the jars were prepared properly, each kernel will separate from every other kernel just by turning the jar upside down.  If the grains are clumped up or otherwise sticky, you didn't follow proper procedure.  There is no need to remove hot jars from the PC.<br /><br />The biggest reason for clumped up grains is the failure to rinse properly BEFORE soaking/simmering/sterilization.<wbr>  Rinse the dry grains so the dry chaff and dust and other debris can rise to the top and be poured off.  Give two or three rinses and your grains will be clean and free of the dust that behaves like glue later.<br /><br />The second biggest reason for clumping is failure to use gypsum.  If the grains are properly rinsed, and gypsum is added, they will NOT stick together later, even if you let them sit in the pc until they reach room temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Long wait for pressure, dry berries; add water?"}}
