One, it kills the germinated bacteria that is making the water stink.  If you just pour it out, you release billions of bacteria in your house, which also makes the sink drain stink since some of it sticks around in the sink P-trap.<br /><br />Two, the boiling, then pouring off the hot liquid helps the grains to steam dry to just the right moisture content.  Draining usually doesn't get the grains dry enough, thus people often end up with either grains that are too wet, or burst kernels after jars are removed from the PC.<br /><br />You should have used gypsum.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye Quandry...
