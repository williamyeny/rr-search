For years, I recommended tossing out contaminated jars because the fossil energy and other costs of sterilization outweigh the cost of buying new jars.&nbsp; Each grower has to weigh the costs of sterilization vs new jars to see which is the better path to follow.&nbsp; <br />The main rule is don't open the jars until they've been neutralized.&nbsp; You can do it by dropping the jar into a large pot of water and boiling for an hour or two.&nbsp; You don't even need the PC for this.<br />RR","title":"Re: using the same contaminated jars"}}
