I never recommend trying to 'save' a contaminated jar.  That leads to more problems later.  The jars aren't dry, or the invitro fruit couldn't have formed.  A slightly dry popcorn jar will actually colonize faster than a wet one.  A common mistake is to think that wetspot contamination is, or is caused by, wet jars.<br /><br />I jumped poor mitch's ass because nobody can keep up with his post whoring bad advice in every thread.  He's on his first grow and has never produced a crop, a grow log, or a single picture of a grow.  His 1000+ posts in less than four months are almost entirely posting totally bad advice by misinterpreting what he reads in other people's posts.  Pull up his posts and read them, starting from the first.  You'll see the steady progression from asking noob questions, to answering with authority like someone with actual experience.  Now open his journal and see all the 'monstermitch's teks'.  They are cut and pasted from mine and other experienced growers posts, then he puts his name on them and calls them his own.  That is plagiarism, plain and simple.<br /><br />In several years on all the boards, this is the first time I've ever called anyone down for bullshitting.  Well, that is except for you hippie3.  I suppose that makes twice now.  I apologize if I've offended anyone.<br /><i>edited because I spelled plagiarism wrong the first time</i>.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: Ahhhh! Invitro pin w/o full popcorn colonization! *PIC*"}}
