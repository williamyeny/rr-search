You'll be left with many strains in the same substrate because not all are compatible enough to combine into a single organism by anastomosis.  Therefore, each 'strain' will have a small piece of the substrate rather than being a single organism in control of the whole substrate, which is better for performance.  That's why we practice strain isolation on agar prior to inoculating our grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: My Spore Syringes are Colonizing way faster than vendors"}}
