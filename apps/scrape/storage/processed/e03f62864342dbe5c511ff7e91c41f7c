It sounds like somebody was really stoned when they wrote that.  What they meant is that you can use all straw, or all manure, or any combination in between.<br /><br />Bagged up composted cow manure from the nursery works great, but needs to be fluffed up with verm, coir, straw, etc., for it to work well. This is because it's so fine, it tends to pack tight.  Horse manure on the other hand, works great by itself due to its texture, even if it's not quite as nutritious for fungi as steer manure.
