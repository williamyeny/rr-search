The mycelium produces CO2 just as you do when you exhale.  The gas exchange is required to get rid of some of that so they don't suffocate. <br /><br />Don't incubate at over 80F or you'll stimulate contaminant molds and bacteria over mushroom mycelium.  A few nickel sized growths is normal for five days. <br /><br />There are no negative effects of looking at your jars in the light.  Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  The total darkness thing is outdated and incorrect. I doubt seriously they'll finish without contamination if all you have is foil over the jars.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Another gas exchange ?"}}
