Over time, the excess water will replace moisture that evaporates from the dish.   The moisture is caused from the inside of the dish being warmer than the outside.  <br /><br />When you pour agar, let it cool until it begins to thicken a bit.  You want it to cool in the bottle you sterilize in, not the petri dishes.  When cool enough to pour without heat protection for your hands, fill your petri dishes, and leave them stacked in a vertical pile.  This will equalize the temperatures between the dishes and reduce condensation to a minimum.  If you don't have a flowhood, you should slide the plastic cover back over the stack to enclose them as they solidify.<br /><br />An excellent bottle for agar is a used whisky or other liquor bottle with a long neck and screw on lid.  You can use polyfill or a synthetic filter disk cut to size in the lid.  Just drill a 1/4\" or larger hole in the lid.  Cover with foil and PC.  The filter will keep the agar from contaminating as the PC cools and until ready to pour.  Don't remove the foil until just before you pour the dishes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Condensation in agar cultures"}}
