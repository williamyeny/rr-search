Elevated temperatures favor molds over mushroom mycelium.<br /><br />Review your sterile procedures.  Nobody has a worse mold-infested building to live in than I do, with black mold everywhere.  I can't wait to sell this place, but in the meantime I can grow mushrooms. . .  Very carefully.<br /><br />Mold spores are introduced after sterilization, so check your inoculation and jar filtering procedures.  Department/hardware store hepa filters are worse than worthless.

You don't want strong drafts in your growing areas.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trich Epidemic"}}
