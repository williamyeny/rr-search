I just looked for that picture, but it seems to have gotten lost or deleted somehow. Next time, use an inoculating loop or piece of small gauge wire.&nbsp; The rounded edge of the wire won't damage the spores the way a spoon, knife or scalpel will.<br /><br />Ziplock bags are sterile when you open them, so no need for alcohol.<br />RR","title":"Re: No Growth In Jars After a Month"}}
