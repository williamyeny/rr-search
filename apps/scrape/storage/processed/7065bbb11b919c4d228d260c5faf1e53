More chicken manure would also help.  You can use it at up to three percent and the pile will really heat up.<br /><br />It's probably getting close to being done.  You don't need or want to let it compost all the way so it looks like soil.  Just keep it wet and turn every couple of days.  In a week or so, spread it out to cool and use.<br /><br />Don't forget to check the ph and add lime as needed after it finishes.  The chicken manure and coffee grinds will swing the ph pretty low.<br />RR","title":"Re: My compost pile on day 33 (PICS) please help Roger Rabit and others compost experts!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
