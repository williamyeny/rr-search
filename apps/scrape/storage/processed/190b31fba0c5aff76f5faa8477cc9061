That's one of the reasons I like the short boil. It heats the grains up so they'll evaporate the moisture off the outside of the kernels when I shake the strainer.  The other reason for the boil is that lots of bacteria has germinated and you don't want to pour that live stuff down your drain where it can breed and continue to fester and stink in the p-trap below the sink.  After a 24 hour soak, a ten minute boil will put enough moisture into the kernels. I use a rapid boil, not a simmer. Remember, too dry is always better than too wet.","title":"Re: 3 failed grain attempts, please help :(","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
