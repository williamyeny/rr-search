An uncontaminated quart jar of popcorn will colonize fully in a week to ten days, so a pint should beat even that. Toss them out and start over with a proper spawn material. Popcorn is rich in bacterial endospores that survive the PC, which leads to wet spot bacteria far too often.  <br />After making hundreds of popcorn jars, I decided a few years ago that the failure rate was simply too high.  There's other problems with popcorn as well, such as the large kernel size which gets damaged when you spawn to manure or straw, leading to a higher rate of contamination later on.<br />Never try to save contaminated jars.  That is unsound mycological advice.  You'll stir up and release even more contaminants into your grow area, threatening your future projects.<br />In my experience, rye, millet, WBS, rye grass seed, and even brf are all far superior to popcorn.<br />RR","title":"Re: Should I trash these popcorn jars?"}}
