You would optimally have a pH around 6 to get nice rapid colonization.  If you go a bit over temp on pasteurization, it won't hurt much.  If the manure ends up getting sterilized, it will be slightly more prone to contamination unless you use a high spawn rate to achieve fast colonization.<br /><br />I doubt the lime hurt, and 6.7 is still great.  When you make the casing layer in a week or two, adjust to pH 8 to 8.5 at the start.<br />RR","title":"Re: I mad a new substrate. pH ?"}}
