For small projects, just use a terrarium with perlite.  It doesn't matter if your substrate is cased or not, mycelium pins and mushrooms grow best at 99% humidity.<br /><br />Never heat a growing chamber.  If you use a mini greenhouse, there is hundreds of posts you can search to find a suitable method of humidification, so I'm not going to type it all over again here.  I just wanted to correct the misinformation you must have heard or read that cased substrates want 80% humidity.  That is incorrect.<br /><br />In addition, if you live in a dry climate, it will help to get a cool mist humidifier and run it in the room your grow is located in.  That should raise ambient humidity enough to make it easier to maintain the high 90's percent you want in your grow area.<br />RR","title":"Re: reptile humidifier.. great idea, but do i need it for casing?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
