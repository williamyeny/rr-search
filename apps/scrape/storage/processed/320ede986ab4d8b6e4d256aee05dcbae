But the shipping from US ---&gt; Canada that 19 bux turns to alot more. We even have to pay duty upon delivery here, if buying from US. So it's like 19bux to 60 then tack on duty and your around 70. I have to buy alot of parts from the US for my chevelle and the shipping+duty is just killer. Always tack on atleast 1/3 the listed prices =(<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Are you sure it's duty you're paying and not GST which covers your health care?&nbsp; To charge duty would be a violation of NAFTA.<br /><br />I grow most of my own rye these days, for grain and straw.&nbsp; I've got a few acres of no-till farmland, growing rye mixed with clover and lupines.&nbsp; The clover and lupines supply the nitrogen for the rye grain.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/11-23/785070429-spring_rye_berries_and_clover.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/11-23/785070429-thumb_spring_rye_berries_and_clover.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Finally found rye berries"}}
