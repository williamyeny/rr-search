If you're spraying for cobweb, be sure to avoid pins, and if you do hit the pins, fan dry them right away.<br /><br />A treatment with 3% peroxide on a cobweb infestation should be repeated twice after the initial application at 12 hour intervals to prevent the cobweb from coming back.<br /><br />Increase fresh air exchange.&nbsp; Cobweb rarely forms when there is sufficient fresh air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Peroxide on trays, getting rid of cobweb, sound?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
