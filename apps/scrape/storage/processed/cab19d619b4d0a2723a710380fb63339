They're just easier to work with and you have more wiggle room.  Syringes made as I said above can be stored in the refrigerator for months, possibly years.  I have some from two years ago that are still viable and the mycelium is still vigorous.<br /><br />I just hate to see the new folks read the constant posts by other new growers about lc, lc, lc, as if it were some kind of good thing, when it's actually a quite slow and irresponsible method.  If the lc is contaminated, you don't know for however long it takes to grow out, then wait to see what happens when you use it to inoculate your jars of grain or brf.<br /><br />It's much faster if you lack agar skills to simply inoculate grains in a glovebox, then do as I suggested above.  A quart jar of grains should be fully colonized from a spore syringe in two to three weeks, and you'll have a thousand times more mycelium than you will in that same time period in the anaerobic conditions under water, which are more favorable to bacteria.  <br /><br />When you shake your grain jar up, you can sniff through the filter for the 'fresh mushroom' smell if you have any doubts about bacteria contamination.  If it's contaminated with the mean green, you'll have no doubt by just looking.  You can't do that if you squirt your spores into sugar water.  What you see is what you get, and trichoderma doesn't puke out green spores underwater.  It grows its white mycelium that turns green when you use it to inject jars after all that work and waiting.<br /><br />I'm just trying to help.  This current lc fad has generated a ton of posts from all the failures that could have been easily prevented by sticking to sound mycological techniques.  The lc success stories could have come much faster from following the above.   Good luck to all.<br />RR","title":"Re: LC growth?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
