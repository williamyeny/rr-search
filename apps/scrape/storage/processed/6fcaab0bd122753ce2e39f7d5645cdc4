So in other words a 5000k 15w will put out more red than a 6500k, but both will put out about the same blue.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That is incorrect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Search 'color temperature' on google.&nbsp; It's the best way to determine what light to get.&nbsp; Anything from 5,000K to 7,000K is going to give good performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: CFLs"}}
