Remember, quarts get more inoculant.<br /><br />Another common mistake is shaking the jar right after inoculation.  Such should never be done.  Allow the spore solution to remain right where you squirt it for a few days until you see solid growth, then give the first and only shake.  This should finish up the colonization process in three days. Remember, until the mycelium becomes dikaryotic, it is very slow growing.  Don't force the monokaryons to hunt all over the jar for a mate, slowing down your whole operation.<br />RR","title":"Re: Comparing Spawn colonization time to rye/wbs/other jar colonization times","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
