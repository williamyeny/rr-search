I also recommend a 12/12 lighting cycle.<br /><br />You also want zero standing water in your perlite.  The function of perlite is to evaporate water to provide humidity. With standing water your perlite can't do its job.  Drain out all standing water and watch your humidity jump to 99%.<br /><br />It is normal when you have a very large pinset for most to abort.  That is the nature of things.<br /><br />There is no need to use a HEPA filter in the growing environment.  A grow area need not be sterile.  Massive air exchange, and high humidity is what you want.  Any way you figure out to achieve those goals will work.  I hope this helps.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help Confirm a RH/Air-Exchange Imbalance?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
