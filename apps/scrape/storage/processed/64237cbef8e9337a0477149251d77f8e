Part of the time you're counting as 'fruiting' is the time spent colonizing that last 20%, and then the mycelium has to 'consolidate' its hold on the substrate, so more time is required.<br /><br />Plain verm is the worst possible casing layer.  It's only marginally better than fruiting uncased.  You'll get much better performance from peat-verm, buffered to raise the pH, and with up to ten percent by volume of horticultural grade gypsum.<br />RR","title":"Re: A fruitless endeavor..."}}
