The gauge will still climb and pressure will still show, but as we know, when air heats, it expands.  We don't want air pressure, but rather steam pressure.  By allowing the steam to escape for a few minutes, the surfaces of the PC, and the jars inside will heat up much faster, and when you close the toggle or put the weight on, the pressure you see on the gauge is steam pressure, rather than air pressure the way a compressed air tank would show.<br /><br />Eventually, the sides of the PC heat up, and temperature is reached regardless of whether you vent or not.  However, a few years ago, I brought an infrared imaging device home from work and filmed the PC as it heated.  When I didn't vent first, when 15 psi was reached, the lid of the PC was only at 190F, which is not even to the boiling point yet.  It took a full 20 minutes at 15 psi before the lid of the PC read 237F, which is as high as it ever read. (I'm assuming it was 250F on the interior of the lid)<br /><br />When the PC was allowed to vent for five to ten minutes before sealing it up, the surface of the lid read 237F as soon as 15 psi was reached.  That experiment made a believer out of me.  Some refer to it as 'overcomming thermal inertia', but I'm not so sure that's the correct scientific term or not, but it works for me.  If you want 15 psi to correlate with 250F, you should vent first.<br />RR","title":"Re: All American Pressure Cooker question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
