I get accused of being on a power trip at least twice a week for moving pf tek questions to this forum from <b>advanced mycology</b>. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/><br /><br />It would take someone at least a year to go through the boards and delete all the bad information posted here.&nbsp; Most of the 'teks' were written by first time growers who wanted to see their name in print.&nbsp; Often, what they did worked in spite of their efforts, rather than because of them, yet they posted it as a tek and there it still is, even though they've long since lost interest and gone back to sniffing glue.<br /><br />I did delete the 'oven tek' the other day because it had screwed up hundreds, perhaps thousands of new growers projects.&nbsp; I have accurate info in my videos, so link to them often rather than type the same exact answer over and over and over again. <br />RR","title":"Re: Most irritating questions you shouldn't ask...
