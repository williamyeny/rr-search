These questions get asked every spring/summer.  If it gets too bad, you can get a self contained refrigeration unit.  They sell them in hardware and home megacenters.  They use a 4\" dryer hose to vent the condenser fan heat to the outside.<br /><br />For terrarium type FC's just move it closer to your AC unit, or put blue ice packs in it a few times a day, rotating them from your freezer.  Lights shouldn't raise the heat.  Use fluorescent lighting a few feet away from the FC and there won't be any heat.<br />RR","title":"Re: how do ya'll avoid fruiting too hot?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
