You'll notice nobody with a 'trusted cultivator' tag told you that your 93% is fine for cakes. Performance of cakes is severely impeded if your humidity is less than saturation.&nbsp; Cakes want 99% to 100% humidity with lots of air exchange.&nbsp; Terrariums with bubblers may have been 'state of the art' ten years ago, but left much to be desired, and we've learned a lot since then.&nbsp; Get rid of the standing water and air pumps, and use three to five inches of well drained perlite instead.&nbsp; Either drill holes in your terrarium, or fan it several times per day, and mist as required.<br /><br />You want to keep your lights on a 12/12 schedule for best results.&nbsp; Make sure you're using fluorescent lights and not regular light bulbs.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help!
