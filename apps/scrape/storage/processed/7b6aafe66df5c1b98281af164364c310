Don't allow them to knit back together.  If you shoot 1000 colony forming units into a jar of grains, they'll inoculate 1000 different spots if you shake well.  If you allow the shredded mycelium to grow back together before injecting, you drastically reduce the number of individual colonies in the syringe.  I suggest making however many syringes you can get out of a jar of grains, then immediately refrigerate until you are ready to use.<br /><br />By the way, after using this tek to make mycelium syringes, you can still use the grains to spawn to bulk.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: old school LC"}}
