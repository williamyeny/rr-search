Be sure the foil is tight around the lid to prevent water entering.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Karma17 said:</b>The jars were cooked in a pressure cooker for 60 minutes on High heat.<br /></blockquote><br />We don't measure pressure in terms of high and low.  You needed 15 PSI for that hour.  When the pressure reaches 15 PSI, you need to turn down the stove to the minimum setting that will allow the pressure to remain at 15 psi.  Don't start the time until pressure is reached, then simply shut off the stove when time expires.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Karma17 said:</b>Then I put the tip of the needle in the flame<br /></blockquote><br />You should heat the entire needle until red hot.  There's no reason to let it sit and cool for more than a few seconds.  Insert the needle while still hot into the jars and allow the first drop or two of solution to cool the needle so the rest can flow cleanly.<br /><br />Another big cause of contamination in pf type jars is if the vermiculite barrier on top gets wet at all.  This can happen if the substrate mix is too wet.  If your filter gets wet, contaminants can colonize from the holes in the lid all the way through the verm to get to your substrate.<br /><br />This time, order your spores from one of our sponsors, and follow the teks and information you can get from using the search engine on this site.
