If you do so with grains, you can destroy the filter and/or dry out the grains as the steam(and the moisture within the grain) leaves the jar.  If you do it with liquid culture it will boil over and/or destroy the filter and crack the jar.  This hobby calls for a bit of patience.  You're not going to speed up a 30 day grow by saving fifteen minutes popping the weight on your pressure cooker.
