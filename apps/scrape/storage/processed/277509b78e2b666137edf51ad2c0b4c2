Growth is flat from 75F to 82F, and then begins falling off.  Below 75F and above 83F, growth is slower.<br /><br />My pf jars fully colonize in 2 1/2 to 3 weeks at 75F.  You're telling us they'll colonize in 5 to 7 days if I put them in an 'incubator'?  That's awfully hard to accept, and certainly doesn't match the experiences of myself and hundreds of members here.<br />RR","title":"Re: Incubator?"}}
