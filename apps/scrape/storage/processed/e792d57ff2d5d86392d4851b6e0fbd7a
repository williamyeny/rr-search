The reason was because the police would bring mushroom growers in to try them and lock them up. The growers had spores all over their clothes from growing them, and so the very act of prosecuting shroom growers had acted to spread spores where they would not otherwise have grown!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I think this story has grown and/or twisted over the years of retelling.<br /><br />Cubes aren't going to grow at a police station unless someone brought in colonized cakes or grains and inoculated manure beds.&nbsp; Cubes in nature from spores grow on cow manure, and they don't grow in Paul's and my climate.&nbsp; It seems I remember the story, but it's about stunzi or cyanescens, and his theory is the spores were from busting pickers, not growers.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dusting dollar bills with spores to spread the magic around","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
