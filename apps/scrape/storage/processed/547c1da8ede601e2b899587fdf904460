Don't put cotton in the middle of a tyvek sandwich or it will get damp and ruin your day.  Use kite tyvek or tyvek from a set of coveralls.  Don't use three layers unless you have a lot of holes in the lid.  You'll cut off the gas exchange.  I drill four 1/8\" holes, and use two layers of tyvek, both on the outside of the lid so they stay dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: 2 Layers of Tyvek too much?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
