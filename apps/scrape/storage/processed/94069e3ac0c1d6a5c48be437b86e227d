Since perlite is porous it has a much higher surface area.  A similar sized tray of damp perlite would have a thousand or more times the square inches of surface area exposed to air, thus would evaporate much more water into the air.<br /><br />As said above however, a mono-tub gets humidity from the substrate and generally requires no additional humidification.<br />RR","title":"Re: So why is this a bad idea?...
