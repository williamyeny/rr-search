Pine and/or cedar should be avoided.   The other woods you listed should all work, as well as Douglas Fir, which is what it mostly grows on along the Oregon coast.  If you dig up an azure bed on the coast, it's mostly growing on pieces of douglas fir driftwood that have washed ashore.  An excellent substrate for wood lovers is a hardwood sawdust, with a faster decomposing wood chip such as fir.  Make sure the sawdust is course, not the fine stuff you get from finish sawing, such as you'd get from a furniture or trim carpentry shop.  Sawmill sawdust is larger, usually the size of cereal grains such as rye or millet, so the mycelium has a much easier time colonizing it.<br />RR","title":"Re: What are the suitable wood types for azures?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
