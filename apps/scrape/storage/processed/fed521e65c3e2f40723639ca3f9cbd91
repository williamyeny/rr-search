It matters little whether it's glucose or fructose.  It's <i>karo</i> and it carmelizes.  Perhaps there's levels of carmelization, and the higher temps will <i>fully</i> carmelize the substance for candy making or some such, who knows.  All I do know is if it has turned very yellow, it doesn't work well at all.<br /><br />That said, I prefer brewers malt and yeast over karo by a mile.  20 grams of malt and 2 grams of yeast per liter of distilled water.  Never had THAT carmelize...lol.<br />RR","title":"Re: Carmelized jars pissing me off"}}
