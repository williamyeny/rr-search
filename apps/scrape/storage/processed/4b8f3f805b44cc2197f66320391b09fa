Its about average. Im only about 100 miles to the coast. I have now stuck the humidifier on bottom shelf without venting intake. Now recirculating/re hydrating the already moist air (sacrificing some FAE). However most threads say 15 min every two hours is PLENTY. This still does not seem to be the case. After 30 min the greenhouse did not have any more humidity than usual. Read days of posts on this, and have used greenhouses plenty and this has never been an issue for me. I have always just ran a 1 in hose into a vicks and into the greenhouse no problem<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I've posted this before, but the bottom line is when Vicks sent production of the 400 and 420 to Mexico, they so completely destroyed their product that they're now useless.&nbsp; I used to keep a Vicks Kaz 420 running next to my wood stove and it would keep our entire cabin comfortable, even when it was -30F and 5% humidity outside.&nbsp; The last two I bought wouldn't even raise the humidity by 2% when ran 24/7.<br /><br />I now have to keep a pot of water boiling on the stove when it gets really dry.<br /><br />You'll need to mist or use the ultrasonic in your greenhouse to maintain humidity, and if you can return the coolmist to the store for a refund, that's what I'd suggest.&nbsp; Until Vicks has to eat a few thousand of those, they'll keep stealing our money with worthless crap that doesn't work.<br />RR","title":"Re: No clue why it wont humidify!"}}
