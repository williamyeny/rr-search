Always allow it to cool naturally.  You also should never run out of water during a 90 minute cycle. 1/2\" of water in the bottom will easily last that long.  It's important to turn down the stove once pressure is reached in order to find the minimum setting that will maintain the desired pressure.  If you leave the stove on high, the water will boil out very fast.<br /><br />There is also a very good chance your pc is ruined.  They're not designed to be on a hot burner while dry.  If it's warped in any way, don't use it again.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dry PC ??","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
