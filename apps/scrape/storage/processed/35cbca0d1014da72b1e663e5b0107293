The top(lid) of the PC is cooler because it's exposed to the outside air.  This causes the steam that contacts it to turn back to water and 'rain' down on your jars.  If you didn't have your jars covered, that 'rain water' would seep in and ruin your water/substrate mixture.<br /><br />If your filters get wet with grain juice, you are guaranteed to have contamination.  It's very easy for molds or bacteria to colonize right through a wet filter.  The only way a filter works, whether tyvek, polyfill, vermiculite, cotton, or synthetic filter disk is if the filter stays totally dry.  That's another reason to use foil when sterilizing, but also a good reason to remove the foil when the jars come out of the PC or steam bath, to make sure the filter material can dry out.<br />RR","title":"Re: shaking spawn","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
