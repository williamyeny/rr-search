It's a two DVD set, that covers everything.  I show how to mix agar, to do strain isolations, cloning, even hybridization.  I show how to prepare rye berries and get the exact right moisture content every time.  I show how to prepare manure substrates, straw substrates, and sawdust/wood chip substrates.  Additional segments are on contaminants, sterile procedures, grow area building, humidity controls, microscopy, etc.  <br /><br />A whole section covers the pf tek, starring our fellow shroomerite Roadkill.  You can watch him mix up a batch of cakes.  He inoculates them in a glovebox with oyster mushroom LC.<br /><br />Trust me when I say it won't be like any video you've ever seen.  I hope to have post production stuff done by Christmas, but it won't be out yet.  perhaps late Jan or Feb.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mushroom Cultivation Videos?"}}
