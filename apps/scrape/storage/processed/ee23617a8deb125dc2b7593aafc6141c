There's no reason to pick them off first.  It's a myth that pins will rot if spawned.  Pins are simply mycelium in a different presentation.  The two pictures below were taken five days apart from each other.<br /><br />If there's a lot of pins, I'd suggest fruiting is as a cake and not disturbing it. A lot of pins indicates the mycelium has changed gears and gone into full blown fruiting mode.  You can still birth the cakes and dunk overnight, pins and all.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597204-Cloning_pins_1.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597204-thumb_Cloning_pins_1.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597212-Cloning_pins_2.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597212-thumb_Cloning_pins_2.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Crumbling after Pinning?"}}
