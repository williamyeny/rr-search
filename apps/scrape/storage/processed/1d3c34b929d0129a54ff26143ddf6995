If a third sector begins to grow from the zone of isolation, it's a cross between the two.  You can verify by placing all three growths on a petri dish and see if a three-way line of isolation opens up.  If so, you've successfully created a hybrid.  Get ready to burn up a few hundred petri dishes before you get your first success, but it's very possible.  The red spore producing cube that is about to go into circulation is a cross between the original Redboy and the PR strain, and the PE6 that is going around is a cross between PE and the Texas strain.<br />RR","title":"Re: Breeding Mushrooms?"}}
