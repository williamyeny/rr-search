The wet cake will make the dry verm stick to it.  Once the cakes are in the terrarium, mist several times over the next few hours to hydrate the verm until it's very damp.  If you spray too much too fast, the verm will wash off, so do it slowly over time.<br />You don't use a layer of verm over coir. You spawn your cakes to it and then place in a tray and cover with foil until colonized.  Poke three or four nail sized holes in the foil for gas exchange.  When the coir is fuly colonized, you can fruit it as is, or you can make a casing layer out of pasterurized peat-verm at 50/50, buffered with hydrated lime or calcium carbonate to a pH of 8.  Add gypsum at the rate of ten percent the amount of peat.<br />RR","title":"Re: 2 questions"}}
