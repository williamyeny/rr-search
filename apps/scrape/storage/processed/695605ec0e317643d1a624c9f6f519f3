I was an apprenticeship instructor with the IBEW for over 20 years.&nbsp; My degree is in electrical engineering and my specialty during my working career was industrial automation and robotics.<br /><br />That being said, growing mushrooms on a small scale doesn't lend itself to automation.&nbsp; Capacitance sensors don't do well in very high humidity applications, and timers to control humidifiers must be constantly tweaked as the ambient conditions change.<br /><br />This is exactly the reason I designed the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>.&nbsp; It's based on the 'automated' refrigeration units that keep the support structures frozen in place on the Alaska Pipeline.&nbsp; If they thawed out EVER, they'd shift, which would rupture the pipe, resulting in an oil spill.&nbsp; Even though it was designed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s it still stands as an engineering marvel, and to this day I'm proud to have been a part of that project.<br /><br />Save your robotics skills for robotics.&nbsp; For mushroom growing, the shotgun terrarium is as automated as it gets, since nature makes it work.&nbsp; It takes eyeballs to know when and how much to mist, so don't try to automate that procedure.&nbsp; Besides, you need to be inspecting your grow area a few times daily for molds.&nbsp; If you get complacent with automation, you might go a few days without inspecting and then your whole area could be compromised with trich.<br />RR","title":"Re: Building the ideal NON-Perlite terarium.
