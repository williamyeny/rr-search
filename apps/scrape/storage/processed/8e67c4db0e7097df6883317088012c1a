You won't get over about 75% with one of those. Take it out of the martha and run it in the room it's located.  Get an impeller type cool mist to place inside. A tub of perlite filled with water is fairly useless as well.  Drain out all the water, and then the perlite can help.  Fill any unused shelf space with trays of rinsed, then well drained perlite.
