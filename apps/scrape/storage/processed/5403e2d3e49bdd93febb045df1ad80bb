It appears that rudeness is spawning more rudeness, and it needs to stop on both sides please. <br /><br />We get at least one of these threads per month, so everybody has been here, done that, before.&nbsp; Notice the leading edges of the white growth in your jars?&nbsp; You'll see a distinct line between 'colonized' and 'uncolonized' areas.&nbsp; <br /><br />With mushroom mycelium, there won't be a distinct line.&nbsp; It will 'fade' into the uncolonized parts as it grows.&nbsp; When you see that solid line, it's bacteria.&nbsp; Another indication is the greasy appearance, sometimes described as 'melted ice cream'.&nbsp; Hopefully, you now are aware you'll need to steam sterilize on your future projects.<br /><br />Also hopefully, this thread can again display civility.&nbsp; We were all new once and needed folks to cut us some slack.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wood shavings instead of vermiculite/Oven instead of pressure cooker"}}
