You want to get your pasteurization bath to about 170F or so, and then dump the pre-moistened straw into it. The wet straw will bring the temp down to 140F to 150F immediately.  It's fast and easy to get it to temperature.  Simply fill every kitchen kettle you have full of water and bring it to a boil, and then dump it into your tote along with a cup of lime for each ten to fifteen gallons of hot water.  Add as much tap water as necessary to bring the temp down if needed.  <br /><br />While you're heating the water on the stove, you'll have your straw soaking in another tote of hot tap water.  I mix dish soap into the soak water as a wetting agent, and shoot for a 2 hour presoak.<br /><br />You want to pasteurize for an hour to an hour and a half, but not longer than that.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing Temps","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
