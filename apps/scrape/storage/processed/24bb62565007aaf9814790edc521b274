The 'incubation' room is the first 20 feet and will be heavily insulated.&nbsp; I anticipate the substrate heat will be enough to keep things at 70F year 'round.<br /><br />I'll attack all that later.&nbsp; For the next week, I'm welding the iron supports to hold up the ceiling from several hundred tons of soil, plus 5 or more feet of snow during winter.&nbsp; After that, it all has to be painted, concrete poured in the grow room, and lots of other stuff.<br /><br />In addition, the mrs and I make it a point to round up the dogs and go hiking or backpacking at least two days a week, plus we have a fruit orchard, an organic garden, and several bee hives to take care of as well.&nbsp; Besides all that, it's pretty busy around here these days, and I actually thought I was 'retired'. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Mine Shaft?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
