Some growers use an incubator, I do not.  As long as you keep them at 75F or better, they should colonize within three weeks.<br /><br />The easiest terrarium is simply a rubbermaid tote with two inches of damp, but not wet perlite in the bottom of it.  The perlite will evaporate enough to keep it at 99% humidity.  Simply lift the lid and use it to fan the inside four or five times per day.<br /><br />I'm sure during the three weeks or so that your jars are colonizing you'll have lots of reading time.   Prior to that however, read up all you can on sterile procedure and proper inoculation teks for your jars.  Don't cut any corners or change the instructions.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help with terrarium please","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
