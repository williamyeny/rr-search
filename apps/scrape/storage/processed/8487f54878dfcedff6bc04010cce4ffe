Just get parafilm, glad wrap or micropore tape to seal the edges.  They're made that way to breath.  You want your cultures to grow very fast on agar so you can make transfers quickly to isolate strains while they're rapidly growing.  That's why you want lots of gas exchange with a petri dish. A small petri dish of mycelium wants more air exchange than a full quart of grains.  Remember, you don't use agar to expand the mycelium.  It's used for germination and strain isolation, and isolation away from contaminants if any are found.   Just wrap your micropore tape all the way around the dish to seal the gap.<br />RR","title":"Re: unsure of my agar, feedback please. w/ pic","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
