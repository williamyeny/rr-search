There are some horrible answers above in this thread that are just flat out wrong.<br /><br />Colonizing mycelium in jars REQUIRES gas exchange.  Two layers of foil are no different than one layer of foil.  However, the foil is for the purpose of protecting the openings in the LID during sterilization from the water that drips down off the top of the kettle or pressure cooker.   With pf type cakes, there should be 4 holes in the lid large enough for a needle to get through.  These are your inoculation holes, and serve later as your GAS exchange holes.  People who try to colonize jars without gas exchange end up with bad cases of wet spot bacteria and other contaminants, or at best they end up with stalled jars.<br /><br />You want to put 1/2\"(1cm) of dry vermiculite in the top of your jars, and then put the lid with four small holes drilled around the edges.  You then screw the ring on, and THEN cover with foil.  The use of micro pore tape over the inoculation holes is optional.  After sterilization, REMOVE the foil and inoculate through the holes, which from that time on are your gas exchange holes.  Don't block them off.<br />RR","title":"Re: But how will there be gas exchange?"}}
