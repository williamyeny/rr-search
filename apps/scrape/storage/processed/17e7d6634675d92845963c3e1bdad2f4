It seems that people are still confusing a 'wet area' that can't colonize with bacillus.  Anyway, it's important when you place the log on your shelf that you poke a few holes in the very bottom.  This will allow any water that drains from gravity to escape.  Don't initiate pinning with a straw log.  Simply expose to light from day one, and when you see the first few pins forming under the plastic, birth at that time.  It usually takes 12 to 15 days from spawning to first pins.<br />RR","title":"Re: StrawLog","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
