For my farm, I use an agar wedge to inoculate a quart jar, which then inoculates two filter patch bags with six quarts of rye in each bag.&nbsp; These inoculate ten more bags, and each of those inoculate ten more.&nbsp; I do this one more time and then spawn to bulk.&nbsp; If I go beyond that, fruiting performance is greatly reduced.&nbsp; However, the above turns one small agar wedge of mycelium into 12,000 quarts of colonized rye to spawn to bulk.<br /><br />I seriously doubt anyone is going to produce that much spawn for cubensis in a lifetime, let alone in a few weeks, so senescence is probably not going to be much of a problem.&nbsp; You're more likely to end up with bacteria contamination at some point in the process, but if you keep dividing jars indefinitely, you're going to have problems.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can Grain-to-Grain Transfers Be Done Indefinetly?"}}
