It sounds like your humidity is too low, therefore the area around the edges was the only place it was near 100 percent to form hyphal knots.<br /><br />You can fix it on next flush with a sheet of wax paper if nothing else.  Let this one grow.  Often fruits that form on the sides grow into monsters, so total yield is usually not that much less than a prettier flush.<br /><br />Heavy misting can also cause the problem by aborting hyphal knots before you even see them.  The sides are protected, thus pins form there.<br />RR","title":"Re: casings pinned on edges"}}
