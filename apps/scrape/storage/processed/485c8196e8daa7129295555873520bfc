Pasteurized material should not be stored for long periods, for best results.<br /><br />Also, bear in mind, it doesn't matter how long the pasteurization water has been at 170F, if your material is in a bag, what matters is how long the center of the casing material or compost/manure has been at 170F.  If you're using bags to pasteurize in, try the filter patch bags.  They can be sealed with a twist tie or wire, and used again and again.<br />RR","title":"Re: pasteurizing your casing layer q's","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
