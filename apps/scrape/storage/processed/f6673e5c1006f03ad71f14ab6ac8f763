You don't want to count the time until the steam is escaping from under the tight fitting lid.&nbsp; If you're counting from when the water first boils, that's the problem.&nbsp; It takes half an hour or so after the water boils before the surface of the jars is up to 100C/212F, and it won't be until after then that steam escapes from under the lid of the steamer.&nbsp; Count 90 minutes from that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you're still getting contamination after the above, then your verm filter is shifting.&nbsp; Get proper jars and fill them all the way to the top so the dry verm filter can't shift.<br />RR","title":"Re: Majour contamination issues with steam sterilisation (moved)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
