The most important pinning trigger is full colonization of the substrate.  Second would be an increase in air exchange that brings about a reduction in CO2 levels.  <br /><br />After those two have been met, light and a steady evaporation of moisture from the substrate come into play.  A good pinning strategy brings all these into account simultaneously.  It's a good idea to provide a few days of darkness just before exposing to fruiting conditions, but darkness is not required during colonization.<br />RR","title":"Re: very confused","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
