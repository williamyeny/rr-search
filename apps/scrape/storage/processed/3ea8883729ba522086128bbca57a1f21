Our hands are always moving slightly.  If you're holding the jar in one hand, and holding the camera in your other, your natural body twitches will blur the pictures. Set the jar down, and use a tripod or stack of books to hold the camera.<br /><br />For glass jars, I use a tripod and place two lights, as you can see from the shadows, at just under 45 degree angles to the jar being photographed.  This angle causes the reflection from the lamps to point away from the camera. A third light shines down from above to light up the lid. You can use regular lamps, but make sure all are the same type.  Don't mix fluorescent with incandescent light or it throws off the camera white balance and your pictures will be yellow or blue. It should go without saying to shut off the built in flash.<br /><br />For non-glass pictures, I set up lights all around the object pointing from different angles to reduce shadows, such as in the cut off stem and gill shot below.  To get extra magnification, you can shoot through a magnifying glass.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-10/329565823-colonizing_brf_jars_004a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-10/329565823-thumb_colonizing_brf_jars_004a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/190239480-P_nameko_gills_14a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-008/190239480-thumb_P_nameko_gills_14a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Taking CLEAR pictures of jars"}}
