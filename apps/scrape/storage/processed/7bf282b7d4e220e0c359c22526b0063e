There may be plenty of moisture in the tub but not enough heat to make it airborne and therefore I've overwatered. Wouldn't you say?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />This makes absolutely no sense.&nbsp; If there are tiny water droplets on the cakes at all times, your humidity is already at or near 100%.&nbsp; If not, the water droplets would evaporate.&nbsp; If you have a made in china 'hygrometer', take a hammer and smash it to bits so you won't be tempted to look at your wasted money.<br /><br />Your statement about having enough moisture but not enough heat to make it airborne makes no sense either.&nbsp; Heat will lower humidity, not raise it.&nbsp; This is why when it's cold and raining outdoors, it's 100% humidity.&nbsp; A 20F/15C rise in temperature will cut relative humidity in half.<br /><br />Bruising can be caused by too dry or too wet a substrate.&nbsp; Simply pick up your cakes so you can judge from the weight which it is based on how much they weighed before fruiting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sudden blue bruising after misting","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
