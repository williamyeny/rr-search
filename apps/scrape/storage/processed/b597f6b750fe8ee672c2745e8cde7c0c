They also won't pin from a dry casing layer, so you're going to have to mist.  I've always misted well, and then an hour or two later, lay a sheet of wax paper over the top.  Lift it up a few times per day and replace with a clean sheet every second day.  Leave it in place when pinning starts and they'll push it up and out of their way as they grow.<br /><br />The most important thing is to mist that dry casing layer and mist it well.  I'd also get rid of the fans, or only allow them to run for 30 seconds at a time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pan cyan trays wont effin fruit!!!"}}
