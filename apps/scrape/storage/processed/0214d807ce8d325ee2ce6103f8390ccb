Doing so will result in a fuller, more even flush.  Many growers place the tray into fruiting conditions right after casing, but your flush will be fuller if you wait a bit.<br /><br />If you want it fast, coir/coffee fruits very well uncased.  You can simply apply fruiting conditions as soon as the substrate has been colonized for a day or two.<br />RR","title":"Re: initiating pinning on a casing?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
