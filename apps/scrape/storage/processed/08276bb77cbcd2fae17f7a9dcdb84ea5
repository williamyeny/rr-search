I'm now convinced the closer to 100% humidity we can get, provided we have proper air exchange, the better.  This applies to cakes, substrate blocks and cased substrates.  Perlite in a terrarium with a cased substrate tray allows us to leave the lid or door propped open to allow for constant air exchange, which promotes pinning and suppresses contaminant molds.  Without the perlite, we need to keep the terrarium closed up tighter, which promotes contaminant molds.  I think the 90% humidity suggestion when casing comes from stamets' books, but I respectfully disagree.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pins? or something else?"}}
