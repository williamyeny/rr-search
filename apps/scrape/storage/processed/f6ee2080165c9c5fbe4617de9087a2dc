Commercial mushroom farms toss out any fruits that have bacterial blotch growing on the fruits themselves.  However, having bacteria present in the substrate is not a cause for concern, and in fact many agaricus species won't fruit at all from sterilized substrates.  Casing layers are not pasteurized in commercial mushroom production in order for the casing to have a high microbe count.<br /><br />Think about it.  Cubes grow wild on cow manure in pastures.  People eat them all the time, even though you wouldn't pick up a cow pie and eat it.<br /><br />Toxins in a substrate are metabolized by the mycelium, not 'transmitted' by capillary action to the fruits such as in plants.<br /><br />Getting nausea and the shits from eating raw mushrooms is not a sign that they were contaminated.  It's very hard for our systems to digest raw mushrooms, thus it's normal for the body to want to puke them out.  Raw mushrooms are not digested, thus you excrete them in much the same form as you swallow them.  Therefore, getting the shits a day after tripping is also common.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can Bacterial Bloom Hurt Potency???","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
