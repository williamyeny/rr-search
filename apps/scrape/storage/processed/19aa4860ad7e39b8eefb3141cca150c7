By layering, the mycelium on the grains recovers and knits together, and then rapidly takes off and colonizes the rest of the substrate.<br /><br />In addition, since mixing 'can' damage the kernels, and a broken kernel is a prime site for contaminant spores to germinate, layering has the added benefit of less trauma to the spawn medium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Layering Vs.
