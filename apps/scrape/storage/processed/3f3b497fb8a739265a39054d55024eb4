In addition, if you make a three inch deep substrate layer, pans won't fruit well, if at all.  Also, a quart jar of spawn in a 12 X 12 tray is only good for about a 1 1/2\" substrate layer, which is ideal for copelandia.  I'd suggest mixing the quart jar with enough horse manure to get a 1 1/2\" deep substrate layer, then when it's fully colonized, case with 1/4\" of peat-verm, buffered with lime, and with gypsum added at 10%.<br />RR","title":"Re: Proper Procedures On Spawning Pan Cyan (myc)?"}}
