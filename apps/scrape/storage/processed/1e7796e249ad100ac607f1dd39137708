I'd suggest tossing out that sweet looking incubation chamber and let them colonize on a bookshelf at 74F to 78F.  Don't shake ANY jars at inoculation, and don't shake pf jars ever.  I also don't buy into the turning them upside down thing either unless you made them too wet and they're water logged on the bottom.  The CO2 exchanges just fine out the top during colonization via the air currents that are created by the heating that is caused by thermogenesis.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about Incubation","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
