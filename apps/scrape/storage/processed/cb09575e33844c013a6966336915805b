Use a tire, 2X4, duct tape, phone book, etc., to bang the jar against to break up the grains.  If it's too full, you're just screwed.  You can't open it without contamination, so either let them go, or dump it all out and start over.  Never fill grain jars more than 2/3 full.<br />RR","title":"Re: jars too full to shake"}}
