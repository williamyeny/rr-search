Sterilization is never complete, and a few endospores almost always survive.  They're not a problem if the mushroom mycelium colonizes the substrate first.  That's why I recommend colonizing in an open room at normal room temperature.  Doing so keeps your filter material dry, while providing a nice warm environment for your mycelium.  <br /><br />Adding moisture and/or heat as in a TIT type 'incubator' will increase your rate of failure.  That's a fact.  It's not a <i>guarantee</i> of failure for sure, but will lead to increased bacteria and thermophillic mold contamination, regardless of your sterilization procedure.<br />RR","title":"Re: Food for thought....
