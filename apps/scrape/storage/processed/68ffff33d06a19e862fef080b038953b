Nothing else comes close.  Certain brands of wild bird seed are second, but still can't compare to rye berries. They're available everywhere I've ever lived.  You won't find them at a grocery store.  Go to a health food supplier or grainery.  I get 25 pound bags of organic rye berries in Seattle for $8.75.  I'm sure they're cheaper in other areas.<br />RR","title":"Re: are wheat berries as good as rye?"}}
