If the substrate can support the flush, it can support potency as well.   Potency is genetic, thus with multispore inoculation, you'll get a different substrain every time, and that's why potency varies project to project.  It's the substrain, not the substrate.<br />Cased rye can do great.  I prefer to spawn to manure, but you can get to your flush sooner by simply casing your rye.  Perhaps you forgot to patch?  That would lead to only a few mushrooms, but they'd be monsters.  I prefer lots of small fruits myself.<br />RR","title":"Re: Giant fruits off of rye"}}
