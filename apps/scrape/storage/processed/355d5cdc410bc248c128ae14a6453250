Anyone who says to leave the lids loose, simply does not understand physics. The point was made in the video to use BREATHABLE tape, thus it can be left on. What would be the point in putting tape on the lids and inoculating through the tape as shown in the 2nd part of the 4 part brf tek, if it needed to be taken off?<br /><br />As for the straw tek, that's only a sample clip that's shown on the site.&nbsp; If it was necessary to rinse the soap off the straw, it would have been shown. You don't rinse the soap off.&nbsp; You move the straw from the soapy soak to the pasteurization water.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I or anyone else tried to say EVERYTHING that could possibly be said, the brf tek would be a 1000 page book, or a 20 DVD set, not a thirty minute video, and everyone would fall asleep trying to watch or read it.&nbsp; It's expected the viewer will be able to figure some things out for himself.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Devil is in The Details","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
