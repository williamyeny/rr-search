Get rid of contaminated projects as soon as they're discovered.  It's true that mold spores are in the air, but if you have an outbreak, they are <i>increased</i> by a factor of many thousands.<br /><br />Many new growers can get away with sloppy technique or trying to save contaminated projects a time or two, but then the trillions of mold spores that were released in their grow area come back to bite them in the butt big time.  If one only wishes a crop of 'shrooms' and then is going to quit growing, go ahead and leave contaminated projects in place, or make an attempt to cut them out.  However, if this is your new hobby and you plan to be around awhile, immediately remove contaminated projects outdoors, or to the nearest dumpster.<br />RR","title":"Re: mold outbreak, spores everywhere, problem?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
