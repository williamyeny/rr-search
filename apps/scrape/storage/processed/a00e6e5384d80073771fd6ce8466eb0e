If you're careful it will stay in one piece.  You can then pick the fruits from the bottom and replace in the tray.  As an alternative to placing back in the tray, you can dunk the block and place it on a wire rack.  It will then fruit from all six sides, although with slightly smaller fruits.  You get more bang for your buck that way.<br />RR","title":"Re: shrooms growing inside of casing!"}}
