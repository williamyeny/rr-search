I have to disagree however that tyvek is as good as synthetic filter disks.  The filter disks are PFTE and ten times the thickness of tyvek.  The filter disks I use are rated to stop 99.99% of contaminants down to .1 micron size.  That makes them considerably better than a laminar flow hood.  They also are infinitely reusable.  I have some that are several years old, covered with rust and other stains, but still work wonderfully after thousands of uses.  Tyvek will work for you 'most' of the time, but if you're seriously anal about success, get the filter disks.<br />RR","title":"Re: MycoSupply Filter Discs.....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
