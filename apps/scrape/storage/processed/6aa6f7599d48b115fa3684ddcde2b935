You can tie a knot in each of the legs and arms, and then fold over the hood at the neck opening to seal the tyvek around the bags.  One pair of coveralls can easily hold 10 to 15 full spawn bags.<br /><br />You might also look into placing a tyvek sleeve in each bag prior to folding them over and placing in the PC.  The tyvek will filter any air that enters your sterilized bag.  I've described the tek here a few times with pictures, and a video tek of it is on my DVD.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: grain to grain issue...(qt to bag)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
