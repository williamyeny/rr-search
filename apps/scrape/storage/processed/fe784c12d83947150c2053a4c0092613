They were quite light in my hand. I handled them as little as possible to avoid bruising.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />As said before, too wet or too dry both give small fruits.&nbsp; The easiest way to tell which is wrong is to lift the cakes as you've now found out.<br /><br />Don't worry about the loose fitting lid.&nbsp; More air is better, especially when it's escaping from the top as it should.&nbsp; You just mist to make up for it.&nbsp; Remember, the humidity inside the tub is irrelevant.&nbsp; The humidity that matters is right against the fruiting surface of the substrate.&nbsp; If you mist regularly, that stays near 100%.&nbsp; The idea is to get the surface damp, and then to have it dry out somewhat before next misting.<br /><br />Lift the cakes mid-flush and if they're light, you can always set them in a saucer of water overnight.&nbsp; Don't allow fruits to grow after the veil starts tearing unless it's for prints.&nbsp; Food and <i>other qualities</i> we desire begin to degrade rapidly.<br />RR","title":"Re: Opinion?
