It's too 'heavy' to use by itself.  When you open the bag, if you smell ammonia, lay it out on a tarp in the sun/air for a few days before using.<br /><br />Mix the ingredients in any proportion you dream up.  Since any one of them can be used as a substrate by itself, <u>there's no rules</u> on how to mix them all together.  Just add verm or coir if the mix seems too heavy.  You want a light, fluffy mix that has lots of air pockets inside so the mycelium can colonize it easily and fast.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coir+Straw+Coffee"}}
