The tests were inconclusive, but in producing my mushroom instructional DVD, I've started up many of the old experiments in order to demonstrate them on the DVD.  Here's a sneak peak.  These pins were snipped off a healthy casing layer that was supporting a massive pinset.  In a glovebox, flame sterilized tweezers were used to hold the pins, while a flame sterilized scalpel was used to cut them off just above the casing layer.  Anybody want to give odds on if cloning this way will work?  I keep hearing that pins will rot.  Whatcha folks think?<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597204-Cloning_pins_1.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597204-thumb_Cloning_pins_1.jpg\"></a>","title":"Cloning Pins Directly to Agar"}}
