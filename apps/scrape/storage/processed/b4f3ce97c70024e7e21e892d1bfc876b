I've read ever since 1985 that 86F is best, usually because of somebody simply repeating what they've read somewhere, then somebody repeats that, and so on and so on.  Now, over 20 years later, they're still repeating it, and it's still wrong.  In my grow room, the day and night temperatures fluctuate as much as 20F.  <br />When I say normal room temperature, that means 72F to 78F.  There is zero increase in rate of growth of cubensis above 80F, and mushroom mycelium often stalls out and bacteria is encouraged in warm anaerobic environments, such as is found in the bottom of  non-vented tubs commonly used as 'incubators'.<br />RR","title":"Re: I need help with an incubator ASAP, please."}}
