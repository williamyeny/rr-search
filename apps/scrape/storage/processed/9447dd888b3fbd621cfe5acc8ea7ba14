Sometimes you'll have to go as much as a tablespoon per cup of peat.  If you don't have a ph tester, start out with a teaspoon per cup, but if you have problems with green molds, up it to two tablespoons on your next project.<br /><br />Another trick if you're having problems with green molds is to use a salt shaker to sprinkle a very small amount of extra hydrated lime right on the surface after you apply the casing layer.  This gives a high ph right on the surface where trich and other mold spores land so they can't germinate and grow.  Don't do this after mycelium pokes through, only do it the first day you apply the casing layer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Calcium Carbonate & Calcium Sulfate","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
