I had this problem when I bought a bunch of plastic lids several years ago.  The filter disk had to go inside the lid, and I saw an immediate increase in bacterial contamination due to wet filter material.<br /><br />If you'll use the two piece lids with the filter on the outside there isn't a problem, because the filter is exposed to air and will dry soon after removing from the PC.  Drill the holes in the lid smaller than the grain kernels so none touch the filter when you shake.<br />RR","title":"Re: preventing filter contams","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
