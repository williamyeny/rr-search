As we know, when mushrooms grow, they don't grow by cell division.  The cells expand as they engorge with water. A small pin has all the cells it will have as a large mushroom. That's why a small fruit has nearly as much actives as a much larger fruit. The larger fruit is engorged with water, thus it's less potent by weight.  That's a fact.<br />Five grams of small mushrooms are far more potent than a single five gram fruit.  That's also a fact.  The picture of fahtsters above is in the pinning stage.  Only a few of the caps have started to tear the veils.  The picture from 24 hours later is on my video, and they're quite a bit larger.<br />All bs aside, you don't compare the size of fruits from a four to six inch deep substrate to fruits from a half pint cake.  This argument will be going on long after we're all dead and buried.  I just won't have people trashing teks because they're unable to pull off grows with them.  Ask any long-time grower who has used all methods, and most will tell you for large amounts of fruits, go with bulk substrates such as manure or coir.  However, most of us aren't into selling mushrooms, and a few cakes are more than enough for personal use.<br />There is no difference in potency between mushrooms from cakes and from bulk substrates, unless one lets the fruits from the bulk substrate get very large, at which time they're considerably weaker.  Think of it like a balloon.  If you blow it up bigger, you don't increase the amount of rubber in it.<br />I apologize for saying bullshit.<br />RR","title":"Re: last casing attempt before switching to cakes"}}
