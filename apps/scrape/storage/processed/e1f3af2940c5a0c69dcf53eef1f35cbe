Agar is right, popcorn is the worst possible choice of spawn out of all that are available.  It is not faster to colonize.  The large kernel size means there is far less surface area for the mycelium to colonize, so it appears to colonize faster because a quart jar of popcorn will finish in less time than a quart of rye or wbs.  However, since there is FAR less surface area to colonize in a quart of popcorn, what appears to be faster colonization is actually much slower because only about 10% of the mycelium that a similar sized jar of rye would be produced, is produced with popcorn.<br /><br />In addition, popcorn is far more prone to contaminants once spawned to bulk.  I arrived at this conclusion after hundreds, if not thousands of popcorn projects a few years ago.  The failure rate was higher than with any other spawn, so I went back to the old standard-organic rye berries, which are also about 1/3 the price of popcorn, which gives far more bang for the buck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Too much water in popcorn jars!?
