If they're rolled up, you don't have a plenum of air inside for the mycelium to breathe while colonizing.  You want to inflate the bags in front of a flowhood, and then while full of air, seal them.  This provides a plenum of air in the top of the bag.<br /><br />A secondary method to use if you've already sealed the bag without air in the top is to hang it from a closet shelf so the force of the grains or substrate pulls the bag open, drawing air into the top through the filter.  This method is inferior to inflating with a laminar flow hood, but better than nothing.<br />RR","title":"Re: Should spawn bags be rolled or unrolled while incubating?"}}
