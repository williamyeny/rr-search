Make the bed no more than about six inches deep.  Dig a hole and put the manure in that, so the ground can help keep it from drying out.  Wet the manure down well, but no pasteurization is required for outdoor grows.<br /><br />Obtain some spores and inoculate some pf cakes, made from brown rice flour and vermiculite.  You can find the pf tek on here in the FAQ link at the top of the page.  When 8 or 10 jars are fully colonized, you can spawn them into your manure outdoors, and the mycelium will jump off from the brown rice flour cakes into your manure.  Lay a sheet of cardboard, or a few inches of straw over the top to shade and hold in moisture while the mycelium colonizes your manure.  It will fruit later in the summer after heavy rains.<br />RR","title":"Re: questions..","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
