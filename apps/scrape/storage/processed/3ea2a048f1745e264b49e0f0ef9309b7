I was thinking it might not be a bad idea to add additional nutrients for the mycelium either in the water or in the substrate. Please do not try and tell me that fungi does not use nutrients. I'm looking for opinions on this topic, I'm not looking for someone to shut me down.</blockquote><br />If you don't want somebody to shut you down, just do your own experiments and then you'll shut yourself down.<br />Mycelium will get no benefit from adding hydroponic chemicals intended for growing plants.&nbsp; That would be like you eating the engine of your car because you read that humans need iron in their blood.<br />Mushrooms get the food they need by consuming the substrate as solid food.&nbsp; The metabolite produced by the mushroom mycelium as it digests solid food is a great fertilizer for plants though.<br />Additionally, you want the nutrient load at fruiting time to be very low.&nbsp; This is the reason we get much better results by allowing the mycelium to consolidate a substrate prior to fruiting. The consolidation phase allows the mycelium to consume and digest most of the food within the substrate, leading to better performance with less 'nutes' rather than more.<br />RR","title":"Re: Advice on adding nutrients..."}}
