Put the grains in a large pot and fill it with hot tap water.  Stir it around, then dump out the water.  Repeat one or two more times until the water you pour off is clear.  The dust and dirt that is in the bags of grain will cause them to clump up later.  You should also use a good sized pinch between your thumb and forefinger of gypsum in each jar.<br /><br />I prefer to get the grains fully hydrated before I load the jars. Put your washed grains in the pot and cover with at least three times as much hot tap water.  I add a tablespoon of gypsum at this time for each two to three gallons of soak water.  Soak for 24 hours, then bring to a boil for five minutes or so.  Drain out the water through a collander, then toss the grains around a few times to help the excess moisture that doesn't drain have a chance to steam off.  I like the grains to feel fairly dry when I load the jars.  Fill them 3/4 full and PC for 90 minutes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pressure cooking grain conundrum"}}
