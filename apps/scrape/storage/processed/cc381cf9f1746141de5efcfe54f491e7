Use manure instead.  <br />I strongly disagree with pre-pasteurizing because half the window of opportunity to get it colonized passes while in shipment.  In fact, more than half the window of opportunity passes during the hot summer months when the wet, bagged manure is exposed to 100F+ temperatures during shipping.<br />I'd suggest knocking on any door to a house with horses out back, with a bag and shovel in your hands.  They won't turn you down, believe me. They're glad someone is going to haul it off. Pick up the sun dried and rain leeched nuggets from the middle of the pasture, not the wet, fresh stuff they've shoveled out of the barn.<br />RR","title":"Re: HPoo help"}}
