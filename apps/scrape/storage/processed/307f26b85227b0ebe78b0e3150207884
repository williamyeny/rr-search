Oysters are EXTREMELY CO2 intolerant during fruiting. They'll grow really long stems with no caps, and the caps are the edible part.  What are your outdoor temps this time of year, day and night?  One solution is to put them outside every night when the humidity is naturally high, and bring them in mid-morning when they've had some light, but no direct sun.  You can increase the humidity by watering the lawn or something in the area you place them at night.  Then, put them in a FC with lots of perlite and the lid loose to get through the day.  Even better is to find a shady, cool, moist place to keep them outside during the whole fruiting cycle.  The oyster above was grown in my mini-greenhouse with a small refrigeration unit running and massive amounts of fresh air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: Healthy mycelium or cobweb?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
