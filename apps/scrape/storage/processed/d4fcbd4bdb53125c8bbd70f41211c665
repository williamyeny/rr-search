Our fingernails and exposed skin are teeming with bacteria.  Our clothing is covered with the mold spores we've picked up from walking around, and the same holds true for our hair.<br /><br />The PC is rarely the problem if used properly.  Contaminants don't care if they're killed by 15psi from a cheapie or an All American.<br /><br />For best results, build a glovebox to work in until you get into the hobby enough to justify a laminar flow hood.  Bathrooms are FULL of black mold and fecal material/bacteria.<br /><br />Use gloves and wash them with alcohol after you put them on.  Flame sterilze your needles and use them while still hot.  The first drop or two of solution will cool the needle, allowing the rest to flow uncontaminated. Flame the needle between jars to prevent cross-contamination, but you don't need to flame between holes in the same jar. If you're working in a glovebox, a hair net and surgical mask are not necessary, but if working in front of a flowhood, be sure to use both.  Spray the air with Oust or a very fine mist of 10% bleach(which will ruin your clothes and carpet), and clean your work surfaces and tools with alcohol.  If something MUST be exposed to the air, make sure it's for the minimum amount of time possible.  Plan ahead so you have everything you need when the work starts. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is the number one cause for contamination?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
