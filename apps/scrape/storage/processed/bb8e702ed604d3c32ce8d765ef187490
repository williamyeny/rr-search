In isolating outdoor strains, I often make transfers two to three days apart.<br /><br />As a final cleanup, I'll pour hot antibiotic agar over the growth in a petri dish, completely covering it.  The hot agar 'pasteurizes' the bacteria, shocking it, but the mycelium recovers and grows up through the second layer, appearing on top in a couple of days.   Shave a bit of this new mycelium off the top and place in a new dish.  If necessary, repeat.<br />RR","title":"Re: Clean culture from possibly dirty syringe ? (azure grow)"}}
