The problem with humidstats is they get clogged up with spores after just a few releases.  If you always harvest as or just before the veil tears, it won't be a problem.  If you like to let spores dump all over the place, your humidstat won't last but a few weeks.  That's why most of us have switched back to timers.  With a bit of dialing in, then tweaking as the seasons change, you can regulate humidty pretty well with a good cycle timer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Looking for full-range humidistat....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
