Then just dump it in a few sandwich-sized tupperwares(or one larger but keep it pretty shallow) make sure it has an even a surface as possible and then case it w/ dry verm about 3/8\" thick. Cover for about a week and let the myc consolidate and then remove the cover and fruit. Simple is almost always better, be diligent about sterilization and you should be alright.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />No way.&nbsp; You should only shake once at about 20% colonization, and then you don't shake again until you're ready to get the grains out of the jar.&nbsp; Shaking every few days ruins the mycelium, and gives bacteria and other contaminants an excellent opportunity to take over the substrate.&nbsp; You also don't case with dry verm.<br /><br />If those are the only two ingredients you have, I'd suggest mixing the moist verm and popcorn together, as if the verm were a bulk substrate.&nbsp; Allow it to all knit together and then expose to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; Popcorn is the worst grain, so consider yourself lucky if you get to a decent flush.&nbsp; I've seen a few, but they're the exceptions, rather than the rule.<br />RR","title":"Re: verm only casing"}}
