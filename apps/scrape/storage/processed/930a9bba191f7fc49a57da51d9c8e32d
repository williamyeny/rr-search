Sometimes, a gas stove will curl the flame around the bottom and heat the sides up enough to melt the bags.  An electric stove won't have this problem.  Be sure to use the shelf on the bottom of the PC to keep the bags off the very hot bottom.<br /><br />Never seal bags prior to PC'ing.  Personally, I'd recommend jars.<br /><br />If your pc got warped or otherwise damaged, toss it out.  I wouldn't risk having it come apart under pressure.<br />RR","title":"Re: mycobag wrapped in pillowcase y/n?"}}
