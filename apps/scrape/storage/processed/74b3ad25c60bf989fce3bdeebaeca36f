I thought red light was preferable? <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Red light, as is produced by incandescents is the absolute worst possible choice.  The light farva86 posted is about the best bang for the buck. <br /><br />I just read that pdf on the light wire.  I'm wondering what you're using for a power supply?  You need to be in the 400 to 4,000 hz range to get the right color temperature, and standard house current is 50 to 60 hz.  It seems to be a very expensive method for a small amount of light.  In addition, you need a high frequency power supply which is an added expense.<br />RR","title":"Re: LED array for FC?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
