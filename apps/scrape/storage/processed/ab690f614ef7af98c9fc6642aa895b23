You can get one of these loops at any local boiler/pipefitting shop.  They didn't have the 1/8' npt size of the gauge, so I used 1/4\" npt and reducing bells.  This keeps the pressure gauge at nearly room temperature.  The one I am using is a cheapie air tank gauge, not a steam one because it's no longer exposed to heat.  It only cost six bucks.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-17/598408768-pressure_guage_002a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-17/598408768-thumb_pressure_guage_002a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: gauge on PC is sticking, what to do1?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
