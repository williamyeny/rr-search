This way, when the substrate is colonized, you can apply the casing layer.  If you mix the two in the spawn bag, you have to break it up again to put into the monotub, delaying the process.<br /><br />You shouldn't need to 'regulate' the heat as long as you allow it to colonize at normal room temperature(mid 70's).  Heat buildup in bulk projects is usually only a problem when someone mistakenly tries to 'incubate' a project with extra heat.<br />RR","title":"Re: Best way to case....
