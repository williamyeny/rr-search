It's been proved by all the experienced growers that 12/12 all the way from initiation to harvest is the best schedule.  It's just fine for the FC to drop to 60F at night, as long as it comes up during the day.   Use fluorescent light, not incandescent which is low spectrum light.  Fluorescent, especially natural daylight fluorescent is the way to go.  Get rid of the bubblers and just drill holes in the terrarium for air exchange and fan whenever you think of it.  three to five inches of damp perlite will deliver upper ninety percent humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: I need help with my Fresh Air Exchange"}}
