I kept getting bacterial contamination in my jars and couldn't figure out why.  I finally realized the filter was getting wet with grain juice when I shake the jars, then the bacteria would colonize right through the filter. I tried them with tyvek and synthetic filter disks and had the same problem.  I went back to the metal lids so I could put the filter material on the outside of the lid rather than the inside. I hope you have better luck than I did, but I don't recommend them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Got Some Plastic Lids..."}}
