You want full spectrum light for best results.  Indirect light from a window is fine.  Hyphal knot formation is stimulated more by light at the higher end of the scale than at the lower end of the scale.  A color temperature of around 6500K is just about perfect.  This is the color produced by 'natural daylight fluorescent' tubes.<br /><br />For the geeks, I'll explain color temperature briefly.  We all know when we heat a piece of metal, it first begins to glow red.  We see this when we heat a syringe needle over a flame.  If we continue to heat it, the metal will eventually glow white hot.  As we heat it more and more the white color begins to take on a blue hue, provided the metal doesn't melt down into a puddle first.  This is why tungsten in a vacuum is often used for light bulb filaments.  <br /><br />The Kelvin color temperature system is essentially the color a piece of dark metal will glow when heated to a specific temperature.  The kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, roughly -237C.  This is Zero K.  The scale follows the Celsius temperature scale and remains constant.  Therefore, water freezes at 237K and boils at 337K.  If you heat a piece of metal to a temperature of 4,763C, the resulting glow will have a color temperature of 5,000K.   The color scale is used as 'corrected' color temperature when fluorescent or other gas type lighting fixtures are used.  A 'natural daylight' fluorescent tube with a color temperature of 6500K would glow with the same color as a dark object heated to a temperature of 6,263C.<br /><br />Color temperature is not an indication of the intensity of light, only its color.  Mycelium forms fruits best with light at the 'blue' end of the spectrum, thus a higher color temperature is required for best performance.  Look for lighting with a high color temperature such as fluorescent.  Cool white fluorescent has a color temperature of 5,000K and natural daylight has a color temperature of 6,500K.   Avoid UV light which is too high, and has been known to damage mycelium, as well as cause mutations, and cancer in humans.<br /><br />Incandescent light bulbs by contrast, have a color temperature of around 3000K, which puts them in the 'red' end of the spectrum, and they are the worst choice for fruiting mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: Do mushies need UV light or just any light?"}}
