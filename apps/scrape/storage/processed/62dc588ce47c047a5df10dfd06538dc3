This evaporation is the number one pinning trigger.&nbsp; The perlite supplies humidity and the holes on all six sides supply fresh air.&nbsp; If you run a fan or pipe in a humidifier, you run the risk of upsetting the natural balance, and either flooding or drying out your terrarium, both of which will reduce performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: self automated fruiting chamber","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
