It then fruited in the most desirable spot.  If the top of your tray is fully colonized, that's probably what happened.  Not to worry.  The fruits off the sides should be very good, and sometimes they turn out to be monsters.<br /><br />As for the aluminum, I've been saying that for a long time.  Look at a tray after even a single flush.  It will have holes rotted all the way through.  It just makes me wonder where all that aluminum went?  I only use black plastic trays.  You can get glad plastic baking trays at the grocery store, and just keep using them project after project.   If you want larger bulk trays, kitty litter boxes work very well.<br />RR","title":"Re: shrooms growing on side of casing... too much light?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
