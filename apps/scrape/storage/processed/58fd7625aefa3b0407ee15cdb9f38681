You can try using it to inoculate horse manure in a shady spot outdoors.  Cover with 1/2\" of topsoil after burying the manure/spawn and cover with a sheet of cardboard to help hold in moisture.  Water only when absolutely necessary, but don't flood it as that will slow down or stop growth.  Here's a pic of an outdoor project done that way on horse manure.  Redboy strain.
