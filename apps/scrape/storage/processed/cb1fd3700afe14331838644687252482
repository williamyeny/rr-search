After a 24 hour soak, I once accidentally left the water in a rapid boil for nearly an hour.  There were no burst kernels and they weren't any fatter than they'd have been after a ten minute boil.  I used them and they were fine.  The secret against cracked kernels is to soak the grains first, and then to heat the water and grains together slowly.<br />RR","title":"Re: Anyone have any luck with a good bit of burst bird seeed (WBS)?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
