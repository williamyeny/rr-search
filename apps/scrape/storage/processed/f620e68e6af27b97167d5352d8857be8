Remember, you don't dump your spawn out on the floor of the glovebox.  All you're looking for is a very still air environment so the air currents don't blow dust and other nasties inside your jars or petri dishes.  It also helps to have the floor of the glovebox damp, as any particles that land there will stay put.<br />RR","title":"Re: Which disinfectant? 10% bleach OR Rubbing Alcohol OR Hydrogen Peroxide?"}}
