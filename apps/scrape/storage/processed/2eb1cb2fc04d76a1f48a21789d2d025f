One, a 25W incandescent bulb only puts out the amount of light that a 2.5W fluorescent bulb would put out.  Over 90% of the electricity used by a light bulb goes toward making heat, and only 10% of the electricity goes toward making light.  With fluorescent, that ratio is reversed.  In addition, incandescent bulbs put out light at the red end of the spectrum, and fluorescent lamps put out light near the blue end of the spectrum, which is much better for fungi.<br /><br />Size of fruits is related to the moisture content of the substrate, and the available food in the substrate.  The tiny fruits you describe would probably require you to eat ten or more apeice to feel anything.  I doubt you have low potency, just small fruits.  Try pouring the water to your remaining trays to hydrate them and get some growth.<br /><br />Saying you're growing 'casings' does nothing to help.  A casing is only a non-nutritious top layer that is applied over a substrate to help supply water to the mycelium.  It is not a name for your project.  I can see how as a new grower you would be confused, because so many people misuse the terminology around here, and don't seem interested in learning the proper nomenclature.   <br /><br />Good luck and welcome to the group.  Let us know how it goes when you add some moisture.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's wrong with my mushrooms"}}
