Then What I do is fill half pint jars with coir and use a tyvek filter on them, I boil the jars with one jar having a thermometer stck throuch the tyvek, I let it pasteurize at 150-170 (sometime I go over) for about 30-60 min. The next day when its cool I quickly open the jars and put them in filter patch bags, using a spawn ratio of 1:1 up to 1:2. Then I seal the bags quickly with duck tape. .<i></i><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Why not just pasteurize in the bag and then when it's cool spawn to it?&nbsp; That eliminates a vector of contamination.&nbsp; However, that's not the problem, contaminated spawn is.&nbsp; Pasteurized coir won't contaminate with green molds before first flush unless your original pf cakes were contaminated.<br />RR","title":"Re: why wont my coir colonize???"}}
