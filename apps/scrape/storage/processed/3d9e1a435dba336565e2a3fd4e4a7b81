Speaking for cubes only, if I just give them 1-2 min. of daylight fluorescent tubes right over the surface moving back & forth for a little while during the couple of times I fan them, then I've gotten literally pins in every possible space on the surface (too much so sometimes I feel.) Even other times w/o every possible space having one, I'll still get a plethora of pins. I guess i don't see an advantage to any more light.</blockquote><br />It's after pinning starts that light really becomes important.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown with proper lighting will be double or more in weight of those grown without.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lighting"}}
