It's just the opinion of the majority of experienced growers that rye or wbs is better.  Perhaps the biggest flaw of popcorn is the large kernel size, which means there are fewer kernels in each jar, therefore fewer points of inoculation.  Not only fewer points of inoculation, but less total mycelium as well, since the mycelium grows on the surface of the grains.  Smaller grains equate to more total surface area to colonize by getting rid of the large air spaces between kernels, thus you have more total mycelium per jar to use for spawning. <br /><br />However, it's a brf/rye thread.  I apologize for knocking it off course to popcorn.<br /><br />I think just about everyone will agree that if you use Stamet's formula for effeciency, where you simply compare dry weight of the substrate to dry weight of the product, brf cakes will outperform just about any other growing method.   However, if you factor time into the equation, grains to bulk substrate will deliver considerably more mushrooms in a given time frame in the same grow chamber.  Since bulk substrates are so cheap and easy to obtain, I feel time to harvest is a more important factor of effeciency for the home grower than simply substrate weight, which might be the more important factor for a large commercial operation.<br /><br />As for potency, we hear as many complaints about bulk grows as pf cakes.  I personally think it's a strain issue and not a substrate issue.  Bunk strains are rare, so if you get one, just do another grow and chances are they'll be great.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye vs PF?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
