Terrariums are not suitable for cased bulk substrates if you keep them closed up.  You need air exchange.  The metabolytes can be simply drained out, or left alone.  They won't hurt anything.  Drilling a hole was a bad idea because now you have fresh air entering under your substrate, which is a pinning trigger.  When you pick the flush, be sure to dump the substrate out of the bowl and get the ones on the bottom that are sure to form.<br />RR","title":"Re: Orange water around my casing"}}
