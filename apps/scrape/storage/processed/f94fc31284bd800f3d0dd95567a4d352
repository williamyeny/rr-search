When you grab a handful and squeeze like hell, only a few drops should come out, and then it should stop dripping, even if you're still squeezing.<br /><br />When you cover a tray of bulk substrate to colonize, use foil and DON'T cut long slits.  Either do nothing at all or poke three or four nail sized (1/8\") holes for gas exchange.  There will actually be enough gas exchange around the edges where the foil is crimped to the tub because that's not a perfect seal.  Gas exchange is what you're looking for.  If you make the holes too big or cut slits, you get air exchange, which is a pinning trigger.<br /><br />Coir is not more nutritious than grains.  It's a bulk substrate like straw, cotton seed hulls, manure, etc.  It needs to be used in bulk, meaning lots of substrate.<br /><br />Correct your moisture content on the next grow, and cover tightly with foil while the coir colonizes, which at a 1 to 3 ratio shouldn't take more than a week to ten days at normal room temperature.  Don't look at it too often.  Doing so provides air exchange, which as said above is a pinning trigger.<br />RR","title":"Re: first time posting! -premature pinning on bulk, and coolmist not cutting it in greenhouse- RR ma"}}
