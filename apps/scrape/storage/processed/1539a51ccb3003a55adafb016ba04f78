It doesn't hurt a thing.  I've long felt it was from very rapid growth, but other times you can flood the substrate and get fast growth without the caps splitting.<br /><br />Just remember it's a different phenomena than cracked caps which give the caps a dinosaur/reptile type look.  Cracked caps are from low humidity and also really don't hurt anything.  In fact, many Shiitake growers deliberately lower humidity a day or two before harvest to crack the caps.  They feel it leads to a better product and in Japan, cracked cap Shiitake brings a higher price.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cracking caps, dry looking casing...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
