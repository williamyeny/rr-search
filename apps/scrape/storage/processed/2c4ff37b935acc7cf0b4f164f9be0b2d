Some strains, such as my Redboy bruise green rather than blue.  Many growers have tossed out perfectly good grows because they mistaked the green bruising for a contaminant. Note the birds nest grow below.  The green is bruising, not contamination.<br />One thing is for sure:  Dunking and rolling did not cause that.  It takes several days for a contaminant such as trichoderma to go from spores to mycelium to green, so overnight couldn't possibly be related to anything that happened after birthing.<br />If that is trichoderma which I doubt, it was introduced at inoculation or from improper filtering/wet filter during colonization.  Rub it gently with a q-tip and see if the green comes off.  If not, it's bruising.  If it comes off, it's a contaminant.<br />Another test is to look at the cake with a magnifying glass.  Green mold spores will be sitting on the surface as a distinct layer.  Green from bruising(or blue) will be the actual color of the mycelium, not a separate surface layer.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-01/641516538-Bird_Nest_009e.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-01/641516538-thumb_Bird_Nest_009e.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-01/641516556-Bird_Nest_010a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-01/641516556-thumb_Bird_Nest_010a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: what am i doing wrong??!!"}}
