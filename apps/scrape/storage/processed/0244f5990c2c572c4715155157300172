It's always a crap shoot with multispore inoculation.  You can let those go for awhile longer.  If they start to make a mess with spores, pick them.  You can carefully slice off the ones to be picked with a sharp knife in order to leave smaller ones nearby to grow some more.  Clean off the stumps that are left when you get ready to dunk for the next flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: Small fruits tearing veils?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
