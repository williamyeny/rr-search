It may not look as pretty, but fewer mushrooms on a tray usually get bigger.  Huge flushes have smaller individual fruits.  It's all good.<br /><br />I think side pinning is more related to the humidity down the sides which is perfect for forming fruits.  You can simulate that environment on top of the casing layer by laying a sheet of wax paper over the tray.  Wrinkle it up first, then flatten it back out and lay over the top.  The wrinkles will keep the paper from sticking to the fruits as they grow up and push it out of the way, and also it lets more air in prior to pinning.   Replace the sheet of wax paper every two days.<br />RR","title":"Re: if it weren't for side pinning!!!"}}
