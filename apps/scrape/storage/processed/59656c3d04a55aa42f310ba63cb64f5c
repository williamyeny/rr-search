If you can maintain upper nineties, that's fine, but you don't want complete saturation because evaporation from the casing layer or substrate is a major pinning trigger.  Very high humidity and lots of air exchange will give you the best pinsets.<br />Once growing, mushrooms do fine in the mid-ninety percent range.<br />I also take exception to the 84F to 86F recommendation for colonization of the substrate.  I've found growth falls off at those temperatures, while molds and bacteria(if present) are encouraged.<br />RR","title":"Re: Psilocybe Cubensis Growth Parameters (as per Stamets/Chilton)"}}
