You won't case it for ten days to two weeks after the coir substrate has had a chance to get fully colonized.  At that point, make your casing mix up and apply it.<br /><br />Just so you can learn proper nomenclature, the 'casing' is only the non-nutritious top layer.  It is not a name for the project or a synonym for the tray that holds it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing this weekend"}}
