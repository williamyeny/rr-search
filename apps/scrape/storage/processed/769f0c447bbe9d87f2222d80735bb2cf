Don't toss it until you check in at the contamination forum and browse some pictures.  If it's mold, it will be a separate zone of mycelial growth, distinct from the mushroom mycelium. The mold spores are what are green/black/yellow/etc, and they'll be a separate layer on top of the mycelium, as if you sprinkled colored sand on the substrate. If it's bruising or metabolites, it will simply be a change in color, but no change in the structure of the mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: ? about dark cornered cakes","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
