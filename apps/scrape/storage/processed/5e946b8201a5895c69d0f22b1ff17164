For massive spore dilution, simply squirt a few drops from a syringe into a large glass of sterile water, and then draw the diluted solution into a fresh, clean syringe. However, such can easily lead to non-fruiting strains.<br /><br />Another method is to make a spore print, and then lay a cap from another strain over the first print and let it print on top of it.&nbsp; Then, make a syringe as normal.<br /><br />To breed dikaryons, place two isolated strains on agar an inch or so apart and let them grow together.&nbsp; If a third sector opens up at the point where they meet, it is a cross of the two strains via anastomosis.<br />RR","title":"Re: A little fun with anastomosis","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
