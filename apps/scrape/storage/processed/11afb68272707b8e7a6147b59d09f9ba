However, most of it has a lot of small wood chips, and trichoderma really loves those.  Just use whatever you have available.  The purpose of a casing soil is to provide moisture and also to provide lots of little air pockets with high humidity to stimulate primordia formation.  Try to run the potting soil through a mesh to get as much of the wood out as you can.  A small amount of perlite added to the casing material helps as well by providing air spaces in the mix that will disappear when you remove all the wood.  Perlite won't hold moisture the way verm does, so don't leave the verm out, but it does provide those air spaces you need.<br />RR","title":"Re: Verm+Peat moss - verm + coco coir + peat based potting soil for ecuadors colonized in rye??"}}
