Take the cake out of the dunk water and rinse under the faucet.  While it's dripping wet, roll it in dry verm and toss the verm on it like flour on a piece of chicken you're going to fry.  The verm will stick in a layer all over the cake.  Get as much as you can on it.  Set in the FC, and then mist several times over the next few hours to slowly bring the verm up to its moisture capacity.  This serves as a moisture reservoir and 'casing' layer.  <br />Most jars are concave on the bottom so there's a small well in the bottom of the cake.  Put it into the fc where what was once at the bottom of the jar is now the top of the cake.  This little divot can be filled up with verm, then you can pour water onto it every day to keep the cake fully hydrated.  That's the key to good performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: To dunk, or not to dunk"}}
