Cold tap water is fine.  Anyway, as long as you drained it well, it will hold your humidity just fine.  As soon as there's no water on the pins, they're good to go.   I would have taken the time to drill a few holes in the FC, but you can easily leave the lid a bit crooked for constant air exchange between fannings.  If you have three to five inches of well drained perlite in the bottom, your humidity will be in the upper nineties.  <br /><br />It also helps to rake your fingers through the perlite to create furrows and fluff it up.  This increases the surface area that is exposed to the air, thus it evaporates more moisture.  Some growers tend to pack down the perlite to make it nice and flat, and that is counterproductive.<br />RR","title":"Re: how often?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
