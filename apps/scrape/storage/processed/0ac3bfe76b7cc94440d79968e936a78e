For example, if you have to leave for work every day for 10 hours or more, a casing layer will protect your substrate while you can't be there to mist.  If you can hang around and babysit your crop, it makes little to no difference.<br /><br />Note this applies to cubes only.  Other species fruit poorly or not at all without a casing layer, and many edibles won't even fruit on a pasteurized casing, it must be untreated.<br />RR","title":"Re: is casing really necessary?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
