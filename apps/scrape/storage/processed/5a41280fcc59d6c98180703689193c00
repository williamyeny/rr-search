You need to be misting every day.  Mushrooms are 90% water, so if you don't provide moisture, you'll have very small fruits.  You can take a glass of water and actually pour it around the edges where the substrate has shrank.  Wait a couple of hours and pour off any water that hasn't been absorbed.  Repeat daily until the substrate is re-hydrated.<br /><br />Mist a few times daily as well.  The only thing about misting that will cause aborts is 1) using a cheapo wal mart mister that spits out large droplets that bruise the primordia, or 2) misting heavily and then leaving the wet pins sealed up without air exchange.   Anytime you mist, use a very fine mist and aim it up into the air so that it falls gently onto the casing layer.  Afterwards, make sure there is plenty of air exchange until the moisture either soaks into the pins, or evaporates off.<br />RR","title":"Re: Contamination? Yellowish spots on casing"}}
