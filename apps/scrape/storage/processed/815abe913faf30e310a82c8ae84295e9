At the very least, I'd suggest removing the stuffing from those holes. There's no reason to filter air going into a fruiting chamber anyway. Copelandias want a higher fruiting temperature, so try to keep it around 80F during fruiting.  They also like a high humidity and lots of air exchange.<br /><br />Pans do best on manure based substrates.  Horse manure in my experience is best.  I've grown them on bagged cow manure, but you need to spread it out on cardboard in the sun for a few days to let the ammonia from the feed lot urine burn off, then mix in a bit of verm to loosen it up.  No verm is necessary with horse manure because the texture is just right.<br /><br />A common mistake with pan cyans is making the substrate too thick. If you make it more than 2\" thick, there's a good chance you'll get no fruits at all.  A 1 1/2\" substrate of horse manure seems to be perfect.  They're very well suited to tray culture that you can cover up with foil during colonization to keep the CO2 levels high and keep the light off them, which you can't do well in a large tub.<br /><br />They like a peat verm casing with a handful of sand thrown in, or cactus mix.  Another common mistake with copes is making the casing layer too thick.  Consider a 1/4\" casing layer just about right.  It's ok if the mycelium completely colonizes the casing layer.<br /><br />The other thing is patience.  While cubes will usually pin within a week of exposing to fruiting conditions, allow ten days to two weeks for pans to show pins.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: I Really Want to Grow Pans...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
