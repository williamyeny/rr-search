And you don't have to eat something grown in SHIT.  And there's no chance of eating SHIT with your medicinal mushrooms.<br /><br />-FF <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Manure substrates in no way compare to rye which is a spawn material.  <br /><br />People need to realize this guy is a troll who knows absolutely nothing about growing mushrooms, which he makes painfully obvious with his silly daily rants against proper techniques, and those of us who would help the communtity with our knowledge.  Don't let his bad attitude and ignorance get in the way of your wish to learn mycology.  Every mycologist from Paul Stamets to Alexander Smith know the benefits of manure as a bulk substrate, and virtually every agaricus farm in the world uses horse manure as the primary ingredient. <br />RR","title":"Re: how bout this?"}}
