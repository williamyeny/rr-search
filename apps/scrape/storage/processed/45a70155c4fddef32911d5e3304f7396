Typically, a blower that size will only develop around .5\" W.G. or so against a thick filter, so if that's the case it will flow 450 fpm before derating. You want around 100+ fpm, but allow for surface resistance, turbulence in the plenum, and resistance caused by the prefilter.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flow Hood---Will This Filter Work for this Blower?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
