Spread it no more than 1 1/2\" deep.  Pans don't like to fruit from deep substrates.  When fully colonized, case with 1/4\" of peat/verm casing mix, buffered to Ph8 to start.<br /><br />The other difference with copes over cubes is they like to fruit a bit warmer, so keep your FC at around 80F for best results.<br />RR","title":"Re: 1 qt (pan cyan) colonized > 5 lbs hpoo?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
