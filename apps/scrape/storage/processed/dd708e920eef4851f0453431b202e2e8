Is it a yellow liquid?  If so, leave it alone, there's nothing wrong.  If you get green molds, take it outside and put it in the shade until you pick the fruits, then bury it.<br /><br />What I meant above about pinning early in the presence of contaminants is when you see pinning in a jar prior to full colonization.  It's because the mycelium ran up against the contaminant and said, \"oh heck, this stuff might kick my butt.  I better reproduce by dropping some spores so I'll survive\".  That's why they pin.  It's not because you had the light on when you checked the jars.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: Attention New Growers - Pinset Initiation Factor"}}
