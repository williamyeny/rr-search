The 3% peroxide we get at grocery and drug stores will melt cobweb on contact, killing it.  Use it full strength in your mister and wet the entire casing layer.  Avoid spraying any fruits that have formed, but spray all the cobweb until it disappears and also spray any uncolonized casing material because you can assume the cobweb fragments have landed there and will soon grow.  Often, it takes a second application of peroxide a day or two later if the cobweb comes back, but the second round usually KO's it for good.<br />RR","title":"Re: damnit not again?"}}
