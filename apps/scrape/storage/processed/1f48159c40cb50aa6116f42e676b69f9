I am just saying i might not be an expert, but I have th facts down. I did a SGFC, humidity wont stay high, im not sure what your climate is like but if it is not 15% humidity and 6000 feet up then my situation has circumstances, that must have attributed to the humidity levels not maintaining. I know misting and fanning does put moisture onn the myc and fanning allows FAE for the water to evaporate from the casing causing pinning, but I also know higher humidity= larger yeilds. TEKs i believe vary climate to climate.<br />Thanks for your insight bhodi...blessings</blockquote><br />Dude, you just described my climate zone exactly except my humidity is closer to 5% all winter and I heat with a wood stove.&nbsp; Shotgun terrariums work perfectly here.<br />You didn't lose two tubs to cobweb because the humidity was too low. . .I'm sure what you thought was a humidity problem was a<i> made in china hygrometer</i> problem.<br />Aquarium pumps won't supply enough fresh air.&nbsp; Lack of fresh air is the cause of cobweb mold.<br />RR","title":"Re: FC TEK..opinions????"}}
