People used to think the mycelium would 'use up nutes' if left after full colonization.&nbsp; We now know that letting the mycelium digest more of the substrate before fruiting leads to a faster and better first flush.<br /><br />This is how I run my mushroom farm.&nbsp; I leave substrates to consolidate after full colonization for at least a month before introducing to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; The result is a massive first flush, at the end of which I dispose of the substrate to the outdoor garden, and replace it with another.&nbsp; This produces the most product per square foot of fruiting room space per month.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ãœber-fast pinning of long consolidated Wild Texan strain!"}}
