They're business people and hard workers, but far from prudes.  Just put down that you have experience and cautiously decline to talk about species during the interview and they'll get the point, but at the same time know you're being discrete.  None of them will hire someone who brags about psilocybes because that could bring heat on them.<br /><br />That said, most of the jobs at mushroom farms are just labor.  There's lots of compost to turn, trucks and tractors/forklifts to drive and floors to sweep and high pressure wash.  Unless you get a job in the 'lab' it isn't going to be much to do with mushrooms unless you're a picker, and in that case you have to learn to work very fast, which is darned hard work, and stops being fun after the first fifteen minutes.<br />RR","title":"Re: A Job at a Mushroom Farm!"}}
