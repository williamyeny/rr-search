The casing can't be colonizing if it isn't there yet.  You're wanting to say that the <i>substrate</i> is still colonizing.  No, you should not use the substrate to expand the mycelum further.  The best time to do this is earlier in the cycle by grain to grain transfer, or liquid culture to many grain or brf jars.  Manure makes a great substrate but a poor spawn.  Just let it colonize, then put your casing layer on and let it fruit.<br />RR","title":"Re: mycelium expantion"}}
