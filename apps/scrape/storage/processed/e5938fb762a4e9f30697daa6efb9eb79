Just drill holes from the top of the substrate up, as well as the lid, but none in the bottom or floor.  During colonization, stick the tub inside another one that only has a few holes drilled for gas exchange, to keep the CO2 levels high and prevent moisture loss.  At full colonization, simply lift the inner tub out and fruit it.  Works great.  If you don't have a second tub to use, you can stick it into a plastic trash bag during colonization, but make sure there's a few holes in the plastic for gas exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about RogerRabbit's Auto FAE Tub...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
