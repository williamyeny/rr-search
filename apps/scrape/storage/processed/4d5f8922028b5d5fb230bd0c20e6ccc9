I don't believe I've ever said that. <br /><br />Mushrooms grown in total darkness will grow straight up, opposite gravity. Mushrooms grow towards light because they're using it as an energy source.&nbsp; They use the energy from light to convert sugars in the substrate to ATP within the cells, is what you were looking for.<br /><br />If the mycelium has all the nutrition it needs, but lacks light, the caps will be small.&nbsp; Add light and you get the most bang.&nbsp; This is really being driven home to me in my Shiitake mushroom farm.&nbsp; I have LED light rope over each shelf, but at the top of the grow room is several LED spotlights shooting down.&nbsp; The upper shelves which receive the brightest light have mushrooms on average double in size from those on the darker bottom shelves.<br />RR","title":"Re: JARS ALREADY PINNING!!!
