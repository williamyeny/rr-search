Don't pay retail coffee prices for substrate.  If however, one is a coffee addict like me, it makes sense to use the leftover grinds rather than throwing them away.  <br /><br />The figure I gave for hydrated lime is to use with just about everything except peat, in which you would double that amount.  1/2 teaspoon per cup will swing the ph 1 point or so.<br /><br />You should pasteurize the coir.  Some, including me have used it unpasteurized with success, but additives such as compost and/or manure definitely need to be pasteurized, so just do it.<br /><br />Don't use urea.  If you feel you need a nitrogen boost, use chicken manure, but at no more than 5% of the total bulk substrate.  Make sure the chicken manure has cured in the sun for at least a week or two and has zero smell.  Otherwise, spread it out on cardboard in the sun until it's dry and odor free.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need for additives when using coir as spawn???And some more questions regarding coir"}}
