It works about 50% of the time.  However, a few failures mean the cost of the grains and your lost time outweigh any savings from not buying a pressure cooker.  My advice is to stick to the pf tek until you can afford a PC.  Pf cakes can be spawned to bulk, and work very well.  You can generate more spawn in less time with rye or wbs, but I'd suggest waiting until you have a pressure cooker.<br />RR","title":"Re: PC problems","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
