(21X44)/144=6.4<br /><br />You want 100 to 125 linear feet per minute flowing out from the filter, therefore in a perfect world with no resistance, you'd want a fan that could deliver 640 cfm(cubic feet per minute) at minimum and 800 cfm at the top end.  I always just wing it and add around ten percent or so to make up for ineffeciency and friction, etc.<br /><br />Look at Grainger.com and find a squirrel cage blower that will deliver that kind of flow @ 1\" static pressure.  A lot of motors rating only goes up to .8 wc, but consider that the same as 1\" for our purposes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fan for my filter.... (please help) im dumb :)"}}
