You can also use a syringe and either inject directly into the substrate or simply spray the area between the fruits.  If the substrate has really dried out, pour a glass of water around the edges of the tray and let the water run down.  The mycelium will absorb it.  Fruit size is related to water content so do what you need to do to get your moisture content up without saturating or waterlogging the substrate.<br /><br />The clusters with black heads are aborts.  Just pick them off when you pick the flush.  Once dry, they're good to eat too.<br />RR","title":"Re: 1st time w/ South Americans -- a few questions (pics)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
