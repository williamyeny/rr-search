I for years have germinated and grown mushroom on a shelf in my bedroom at normal room temperature, winter and summer. I do not even own an incubator.<br /><br />Two, light has neither good nor ill effects on growing mushroom mycelium. It will not hurt, nor help, but there is no need to keep your jars in the dark.  Stamets makes this clear in GGMC.  He used to recommend incubation in total darkness(TMC), but he no longer recommends this.  I concur. If you visit fungi perfecti you will see he has 10,000 square feet of incubation space that is exposed to overhead fluorescent lights during the full work day. My jars sit on a shelf in an open room as said above and they're exposed to light from the day spores are started.<br /><br />Three, using too many spores is very counterproductive, not to mention wasteful.  Too many substrains will germinate and they'll be competing for food, and against each other.  Your harvest will be much less than your harvest would be if you used 1/4 of one print to inoculate all 12 jars. When it comes to spores, more is not better.  I hope this helps.<br />RR","title":"Re: Best place to sit my newly inocced jars","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
