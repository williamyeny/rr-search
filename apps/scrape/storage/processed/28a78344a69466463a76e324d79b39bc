You need to spread the manure out on a tarp in the sun for a day or two until the ammonia evaporates off.  At that time, hydrate and pasteurizize.  I wouldn't suggest your previous method unless you only put a quart or so of manure into each bag.  Jars work well with that method.  With smaller containers, they heat up sooner than a large oven type bag.<br />RR","title":"Re: ammonia smell","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
