The holes in your jars will allow pressure to equalize.  The pressure will be the same inside your jar as outside.  Higher pressure is great.   Use it if you got it.  Leave the vent or regulator on your autoclave/pc open for a few minutes to exhaust the air in the chamber.  Close the vent and allow pressure to build.  Give an hour at 20 to 30 psi.   I also use an hour and a half at 15psi.  This will not overcook your grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: sterilization/ autoclave"}}
