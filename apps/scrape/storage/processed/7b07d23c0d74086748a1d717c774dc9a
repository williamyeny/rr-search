I see there's already a green jumper there to bond the motor to the blower. This is your ground and will ensure the breaker trips in your panel if something shorts out.<br /><br />Connect the white wire from your cord to the white wire coming from the motor.&nbsp; Connect the black wire from your cord to either the black, blue or red wire, depending if you want high, medium, or low speed respectively. Insulate the two speed wires you don't use so they don't short out.&nbsp; I wouldn't use that switch.&nbsp; Once you determine which speed it needs to run, you'll never change it, so just wire it and leave the switch out.<br /><br />You're going to want about 500 CFM @ 1\" static pressure to go with that 24 X 24 filter.<br />RR","title":"Re: Help wiring squirrel cage blower for flowhood"}}
