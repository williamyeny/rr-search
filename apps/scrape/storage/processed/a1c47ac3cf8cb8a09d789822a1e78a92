Until then, everybody seemed to repeat the lie that coir has no 'nutes'. In fact, saying that coir is better suited as a substrate than a casing material led to me getting banned from one of the <i><u>other</u></i> mushroom boards for being on a 'jihad' against coir and popcorn spawn. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/> <br />RR","title":"Re: verm/coir casing on coir substrate?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
