However the ones that fruited would not only have been competing with spores of substrains of its strain but also spores of a whole strain all together. That means they are probably pretty strong. If you isolated and cloned one of them it would probably fair quite well.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Both of these comments are 100% incorrect.<br /><br />In addition, 'strains' of a commons species will easily 'mate' and do not meet the criteria for being called a hybrid.<br /><br />It makes no difference to to the species whether the spores came from mushroom caps from different regions.<br /><br />To say otherwise is as incorrect as saying that a white woman from Europe who mates with a black man from Africa will have the genes 'compete' with each other and the child will be either white or black, but not a combination of the two.&nbsp; It just simply doesn't work that way.<br />RR","title":"Re: ever heard of the hybrid theory?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
