The small amount of static pressure caused by the small hose, and blocking the intended output will force the mist up into the motor bushings, ruining them. After a month or two, they get really noisy, then fail shortly afterwards. I did similar modifications to this for many years, even using a two inch pvc pipe from the humidifier and never once had a coolmist last over 90 days, and of course you can't return them to the store for credit if they've been modified.<br /><br />I have since switched to having the unmodified humidifiers sit on a shelf inside the greenhouse and I'm now over a year without a failure.  If you wish the humidifier to provide air exchange, you can cut a hole in the greenhouse large enough for half of the coolmist to sit inside the greenhouse, with the intake half of the coomist sitting outside the greenhouse.  This way, you don't increase the static pressure, and of course if it does fail during the two year warranty, you can return it to the store for credit.<br /><br />It would be interesting to hear from people that have used such a setup and had the humidifiers last the warranty period.  They just have not done so in my grow areas.<br />RR","title":"Re: My contribution to the community."}}
