Growth slows down dramatically at 83F and above.  Growth is flat between 75F and 82F, and then slows down above that.  I recommend 75F because bacteria and thermophilic molds are slightly suppressed at that temperature, but the cubensis mycelium is in its maximum rate-of-growth temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: tek question regarding temp during mycelium growth","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
