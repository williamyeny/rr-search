If the mycelium is yellow, it indicates mold.<br /><br />It's no secret that I recommend against using spore syringes to make LC.  It doubles the risk of contamination because you're using a syringe to make inoculations twice instead of once, and you also don't know what you have until the LC grows out, and then you use it to inoculate grains.<br /><br />You'd be miles ahead to first learn agar work and use that to isolate healthy mycelium away from contamination, or second choice to simply use your spore syringe to inoculate the grains directly.<br />RR","title":"Re: Yellow Mycellium??"}}
