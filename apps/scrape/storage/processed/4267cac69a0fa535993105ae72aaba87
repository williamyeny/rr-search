They read 'hi' or '88888' over about 90%.  Test yours soon so you can return for credit if it's one of the bad ones.  I think hippiechick has a Taylor unit that works.  You might search using her name and Taylor to see if you can find a model number.  I prefer the mechanical hygrometers because you can calibrate them for 99%, making them extremely accurate at high humidities.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: Thermo-Hygrometer","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
