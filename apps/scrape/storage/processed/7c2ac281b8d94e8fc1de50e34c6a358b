It's nearly 80% alcohol, and 20% inert ingredients. The other active ingredient is only 1/10th of 1%.  It will kill spores if it contacts them.  It's a surface disinfectant, but 70% alcohol is much cheaper, and just as effective for surfaces such as tabletops.  I use lysol to spray the surface of my flowhood a minute before starting it up.  This helps to kill of the buggars that have landed there since the last use so they don't get blown into my work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lysol Spray","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
