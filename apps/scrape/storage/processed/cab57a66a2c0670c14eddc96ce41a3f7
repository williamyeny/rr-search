A kilowatt-hour is one killowat(1000 watts) used for one hour.<br /><br />This means a 1500 watt heater running full time would use 15 cents per hour.<br /><br />My space heater has settings for 400 watt, 750 watt, and 1500 watt.  I use the 400 watt setting, so at the figure above of ten cents per kwh, that heater uses 4 cents per hour.  As Wronguy stated, you only pay when it's actually running.<br /><br />I'd recommend a space heater over a tit or incubator.  Just get your room up to 75 or so in the winter and everything will grow fine.  Jars may need a day or two longer than at 80, but who cares?<br />RR","title":"Re: Electric Bills","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
