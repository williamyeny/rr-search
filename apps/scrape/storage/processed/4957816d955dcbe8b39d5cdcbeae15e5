It will break many of them in half, exposing uncolonized grains into a non-sterile envrionment.   Bang the jars against a fully inflated tire.  I use a mountain bike tire and air it up nice and hard each time I break up jars.  You can also bang them against a phone book, or even a 2 X 4, as long as it isn't oak or some other hardwood.
