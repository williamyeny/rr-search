What right do people who have only made a few grows have to make such a claim?  Do you see any old timers spouting such nonesense?<br /><br />Some strains turn out to be bunk.  That is a fact.  By 'strain', I mean the isolate that you end up with from multispore inoculation, not some particular vendor named strain.  If a newbie grows on brf and gets a bunk strain, he tells everyone that brf is crap. If he grows again on horse manure and gets a good isolate, he tells everyone that horse manure rules.   Get a grip people.<br /><br />Size and substrate material will affect the total yield of your crop. Some very experienced growers around here use nothing but brf cakes for one reason.  They work.  Personally, I prefer horse manure, but it's not for the potency, but the yield and ease.  If you use a substrate that provides basic food, your mycelium will do the rest.  If I see another brf sucks thread, I think I'll puke.<br />RR<b></b>","title":"Re: BRF isn't very good for potency.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
