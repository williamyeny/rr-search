What you look for is the results of the bacteria.  As I said in the other thread, you have more than one type of mycelium, which is another problem.  The leading edge of the growth is a solid line instead of 'fading' as strands reach out ahead of the main part of the growth.<br /><br />Did you shake the jars completely up as suggested?  Bang the jar aginst a tire until each and every kernel is separated from each other.  If it takes more than half a dozen whacks against the tire to break totally up, it's another indication of bacteria.  They make the grains stick together like a big chunk of rubber.<br /><br />Look at the jar on the right below.  The jar on the left is copelandia, so disregard.  Notice how the strands of mycelium on the jar on the right 'blend' into the grains at the leading edge of the growth?  Yours has a line just like if you cut it with a knife.  That means your mycelium is running up against a natural barrier, such as contamination.   Also note the appearance of the grains in my pic compared to yours.  The grains below appear dry, while yours seem to have a layer of grease or oil on them.  That's another indication of bacterial contamination.<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-17/627178716-Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-17/627178716-thumb_Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg\"></a><br />RR","title":"Re: Bacteria???","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
