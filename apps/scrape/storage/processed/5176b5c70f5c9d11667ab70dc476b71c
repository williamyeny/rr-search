Typical LEDs (the little guys from radioshack) have a voltage drop of .7v across the leads. Anyway without a current limiting resistor, regardless of the voltage, the LEDs will draw as much current as the source can supply (V=IR, R approaches 0). I guarantee this will blow your bulbs.</blockquote><br />Or, series enough that the voltage drop equals the supply voltage.&nbsp; Assuming a .7 drop per LED, 17 in series would drop 12 volts. Zener diodes come to mind for those of us geek enough to know how to use them as regulators. However, I would imagine those without electrical skills are going to buy pre-made strings that come with a power supply ready to plug in.<br />RR","title":"Re: Good Deals on LED"}}
