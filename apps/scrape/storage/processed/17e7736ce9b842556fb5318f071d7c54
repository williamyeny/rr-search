When I say it's best not to let the humidity drop below 35%, that's referring to ambient humidity. For those of us who live in extremely dry winter climates, it's important to run a humidifier indoors during winter.<br /><br />Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, and the shotgun terrarium is designed to operate on ambient currents within a room, not on a fan induced windstorm.&nbsp; Plugging holes stops this natural process and lowers humidity.&nbsp; Run a humidifier in the winter indoors, and mist as required to replace lost moisture.<br />RR","title":"Re: I live where ambient humidity is frequently <35%.
