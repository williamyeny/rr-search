Full colonization of the available substrate does that job.<br /><br />Cubes will pin in total darkness.&nbsp; If you want them to develop fat heavy caps and secure stems, they need bright light.&nbsp; If you want a stellar pinset instead of a 'few stringy' fruits, you need bright light.&nbsp; The mycelium benefits from bright light in a normal day/night routine from at least the last week of colonization all the way through harvesting mature fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: Details about Fruiting in the Dark. ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
