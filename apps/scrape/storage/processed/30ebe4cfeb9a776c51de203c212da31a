Every place carries Ball jars, but the half pint wide mouths are Kerr brand, which is stupid because Ball actually owns Kerr now. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />I can't remember the last time I went into a neighborhood grocery store and didn't find 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars on the shelf. Gosh, the nearest town to me only has 600 people and the only grocery store in town has 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars, as does the local hardware store(not Ace). <br /><br />You guys need to boycott walmart and other big-box stores and shop at stores which aren't actively trying to destroy our way of life.<br />RR","title":"Re: what kinda jars should i use?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
