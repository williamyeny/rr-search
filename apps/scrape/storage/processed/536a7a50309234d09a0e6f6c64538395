Any standing water makes that part of the perlite useless, and you have water all the way to the top, so it may as well not even be there.  Drill holes in the bottom of your terrarium to let the water out and watch your humidity go to 99%.<br /><br />Then, get that polyfill or whatever it is out of the holes so air can exchange or you'll end up with contaminants.  You want well drained perlite for humidity, and open holes or a loose lid for air exchange and you'll be fine.<br />RR","title":"Re: cant keep up humidity! commencing drastic measures!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
