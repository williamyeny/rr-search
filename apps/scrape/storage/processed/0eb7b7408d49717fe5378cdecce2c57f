Heaters are not designed for 90% ambient humidity. Never use a thermostat rated lower than the device it controls.&nbsp; Doing so is a fire hazard.&nbsp; If the heater doesn't have a built in thermostat, you can get 'line voltage thermostats' at your local hardware store.<br /><br />The cool mists in your room can run 24/7 if necessary.&nbsp; I run two in my house all winter, since it's below zero and I have a wood stove cranked up pretty darn hot most of the time, which really dries out the air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Easy hi-tec automated greenhouse!
