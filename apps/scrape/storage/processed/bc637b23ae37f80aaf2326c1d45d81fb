That does not mean 30 minutes from the time your PC reaches pressure, but 30 minutes from the time the interior of the jar or bag of grains reaches full temperature.<br /><br />The way to achieve this is to always use the minimum stove setting that will hold 15 psi.  If your PC rattles at 15, then use 14 so it doesn't rattle at all.  Now, you'll notice after pressure is reached, for about 1/2 an hour or so, you'll have to constantly turn down the stove in order to prevent the weight rattling.  Once you reach the point where you don't need to reduce the stove burner anymore, your substrate is fully heated all the way through.  At this point, allow 1/2 hour to ensure the bacterial endospores in the very center of the substrate bag are killed off.<br /><br />If you're above 5,000 feet elevation, double the above time to one hour. <br />RR","title":"Re: PC Times Table"}}
