In a separate pan I boil the syringe for at least half an hour.

Swabbing the needle with alcohol does nothing for the contaminants that have become lodged in the interior of the needle.  In addition, look at a needle under a microscope.  There's many little holes and imperfections on the surface that alcohol is very likely to miss and thus the contaminant molds or bacteria survive.  Always flame before first use, and flame again between each jar to prevent cross-contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: Making an LC out of a syringe of sterile water and a fully colonized jar"}}
