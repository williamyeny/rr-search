Not O2, just air. If your friend is reporting no gas exchange, he's either lying or the jars are not sealed as he thinks they are.&nbsp; Back in the day, we would use the lids upside down with no holes and no filter at all, and enough gas exchange would <i>usually</i> occur around the imperfect seal on the lid, provided we didn't screw the ring down tight.&nbsp; Mycelium requires air for its metabolic processes, and generates CO2 as a byproduct.&nbsp; Too little air, or too much CO2 and the mycelium shits the bed.<br /><br />On the jars that stalled, we could loosen the lid ring and the mycelium would take back off again.&nbsp; Of course, we also had about a 20% contamination rate, simply because we hadn't developed PTFE or tyvek filters yet.<br /><br />One of the major causes of stalling grain jars with our new members here is lack of gas exchange.&nbsp; It's been proved so many thousands of times it's beyond debate.&nbsp; I've even lost a few master culture slants due to making too many wraps of parafilm around the loose lid.<br />RR","title":"Re: oxygen during colonization question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
