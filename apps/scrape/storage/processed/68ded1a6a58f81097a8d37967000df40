Lift it to fan and/or mist.&nbsp; Increased CO2 levels are detrimental to pinning, not an asset.<br /><br />Freshly made straw logs will drip for a couple of days due to the excess water being squeezed out of the straw.&nbsp; Remember to pack straw logs tightly.&nbsp; Put a tray under them for a few days.&nbsp; The full tek is on my DVD, but you can get the idea from <a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/f4d6984c-0a2f-42b0-852e-e49a9ed5daff.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">this short clip</a>.<br /><br />You can fruit straw logs in a mini-greenhouse or even in the open air if your house isn't too dry.&nbsp; They also do well in the spring and fall months outdoors in a shady spot, especially if it's the rainy season.&nbsp; Ditto for laundry baskets.<br />RR","title":"Re: confused about co2 and straw"}}
