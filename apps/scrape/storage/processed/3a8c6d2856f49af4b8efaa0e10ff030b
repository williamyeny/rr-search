They don't melt if you purchased real autoclavable bags.  <br /><br />If you run a gas stove, keep the flame low.  The only reason I could see for bags melting is if a flame was wrapping around the edges and coming up the sides.   I use an electric stove so heat only comes from the bottom below the waterline, thus bags don't melt, touching the sides or not.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pressure cooking filter patch bags, can you use AA 25x's liner without melting the bags?
