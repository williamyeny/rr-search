This will allow air to get in under the wax paper easily, and the fruits will push it out of the way as they grow.<br /><br />It sounds like your substrate is dry.  I'd try actually pouring some water over the casing layer in between the pins.  You can also pour some around the edges of the tray so it runs to the bottom.  After a couple of hours, tilt the tray to pour off any water that wasn't absorbed.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pan cyan trays wont effin fruit!!!"}}
