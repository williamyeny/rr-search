There are no green contaminants of mushroom culture that will make you ill to eat unless you're allergic to penicillin, in which case don't eat any substrate that has blue circles on it.  The mushrooms will be fine.  If your fruits are contaminated with bacteria, they can give you food poisoning, so boiling would be in order.
