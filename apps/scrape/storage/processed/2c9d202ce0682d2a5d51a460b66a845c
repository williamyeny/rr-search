The dark period need not be totally dark or uninterrupted.&nbsp; If you need to turn on your room light to see at night, it won't hurt the mushrooms, but they do need a normal day/night schedule for best performance. <br /><br />Put the terrarium on a table and elevate it off the table with blocks to allow air to circulate around all six sides.<br />RR","title":"Re: shotgun terrarium","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
