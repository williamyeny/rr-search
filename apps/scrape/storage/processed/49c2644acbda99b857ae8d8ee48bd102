Pouring hot water on a substrate is not pasteurization.&nbsp; Pasteurization involves fully hydrating the substrate to field capacity, and then loading into bags or jars.&nbsp; Insert a meat thermometer in the center of the mass, and slowly heat the substrate to 140F and hold it there for 60 to 90 minutes.&nbsp; For best results, make sure the substrate never exceeds 160F at any time in the process.<br /><br />2. If you supplement with coffee grinds, you must use <b>spent</b> coffee grinds, not fresh. In other words, brew a pot of coffee with it first.&nbsp; If you use fresh, you're brewing liquid coffee into your substrate, and liquid coffee will be green within days.<br />RR","title":"Re: spawning to bulk problem","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
