It doesn't matter what material is holding the substrate or grains, it matters how much grains are contained within.  The more grains, the longer it takes for the heat to reach the center of the bag.  If your bags are the size of quart jars, PC for 90 minutes.  If they're bigger, go for two hours.  I cook 6 lb substrate bags for 2 hours, so no reason to go longer than that.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn Bags","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
