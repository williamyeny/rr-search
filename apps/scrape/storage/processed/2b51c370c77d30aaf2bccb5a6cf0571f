(assuming for the sake of demonstration we consider your parents first generation.)<br /><br />Senescence has nothing to do with generations.&nbsp; It has to do with the number of cell divisions since the strain originated by the pairing of two compatible hyphae.<br /><br />If you take third generation mycelium and print a fruit, when you germinate those spores, it's the fourth generation. Each time you do that there will be less genetic difference or variation between the various strains that arise.&nbsp; You'll still want to isolate strains for potency if that's what your goal is.<br />RR","title":"Re: mushroom potency","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
