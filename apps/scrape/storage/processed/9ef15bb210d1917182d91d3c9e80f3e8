If you maintain your house at normal indoor temperatures, your projects will do just fine.  There is certainly no need to incubate jars over 80F, and to do so raises contaminant risks considerably.  The inside of your jars will be 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the surrounding air.  If you heat a chamber up to 86, your jars will be near 90, and much more likely to contaminate.<br /><br />I colonize on a bookshelf in a spare bedroom, and no attempt is taken to prevent the jars from receiving normal room lighting. I then fruit in a small greenhouse type enclosure with no heat applied during the growing process.  If it's deep winter and your room is a bit cold, run a small space heater to heat the entire room to 75 or so.  That temperature will work just fine for colonization, as well as fruiting.  There's no need to make growing any harder than it already is. Keep it simple.<br />RR","title":"Re: Temperatures"}}
