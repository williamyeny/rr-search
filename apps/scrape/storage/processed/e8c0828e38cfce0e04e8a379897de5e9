I just wrap the wire around the end of the bag like a twist tie on a loaf of bread, after first inflating the bag in front of the flowhood so there is a plenum of sterile air within.<br /><br />This allows me to open the bag in front of the flow hood at fruiting time to exchange the air, then seal it back up.<br /><br />As said above, fold the bag over several times before PC'ing, then set a plate or something on top of the bags to press the folded seal flat.  I use no clothespins, only the flat seal which seems to work well as long as something is holding it closed.  Be sure to PC long enough as spawn bags hold more than jars.  When I PC four spawn bags with six pounds of spawn or wood chips/sawdust each, I go for 3 1/2 hours at fifteen psi.  Use some rings from your jars to stuff between the bags to separate them so steam can penetrate throughout the PC and on all sides of each bag.<br />RR","title":"Re: help! - spawn bags in pressure cooker"}}
