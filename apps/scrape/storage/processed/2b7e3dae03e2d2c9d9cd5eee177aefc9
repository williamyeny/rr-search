They pin around the edges because your casing layer was too dry and that was where the highest humidity was.  Don't worry about the ones that grow under the substrate.  They're not going to rot during the time it takes the flush on top to grow.  When you remove the current flush, tip the tray over and remove the substrate to pick the ones underneath, then dunk and repeat.<br />RR","title":"Re: What to do about sidepining.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
