Sorry guys, but that doesn't make one bit of sense. It's against all logic. First of all, they probably wouldn't even pin in the darkness, much less grow. Belive me, I really would like to belive that, but it doesn't make sense to me at all.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The mushrooms were NOT grown in the dark.&nbsp; We've known for years that the psilocin degrades during drying, and we also know that our indoor mushrooms which are RARELY dried in sunlight are more potent.&nbsp; This study is addressing natural SUNLIGHT, not our normal indoor lighting.&nbsp; If you dry a mushroom in the sun and measure psilocin after drying and it weighs .0002 gram, then a 100X increase means there would have been .02 grams of psilocin in the fruit, had it been harvested and dried in the dark.<br /><br />The abstract didn't say the fruits were 100X more potent, just that there was 100X the amount of psilocin when kept out of sunlight during harvest and drying.&nbsp; We've known this for decades, just not by how much.&nbsp; What they tried to do was quantify what people around here have reported since day one.&nbsp; Apparently the study didn't measure any effect on psilocybin.<br />RR","title":"Re: Must Read!!
