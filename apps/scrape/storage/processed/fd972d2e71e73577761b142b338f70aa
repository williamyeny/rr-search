Don't case over 1/2\" thick unless your substrate is 4\" thick or more. Casing material should be pasteurized, not sterilized. I can think of no reason why you'd apply a casing layer and then stick it in the refrigerator.   Cold stops mycelium growth, and when fruiting a cased substrate you want to encourage mycelium growth.<br /><br />The rapidly growing grey mycelium is cobweb mold.  Hit it with peroxide straight from the bottle to disolve it on contact.<br /><br />It's probably too late to save this one, but next time, crumble your cakes into a tray, apply 1/2\" or less of pasteurized peat/verm casing, then cover with foil for a few days until mycelium pokes through the surface, then expose to fruiting conditions.<br />RR","title":"Re: I made my casing too thick, and now I have no shrooms :-("}}
