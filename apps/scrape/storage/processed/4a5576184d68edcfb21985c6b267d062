In the time you can fill an 18 wheeler with grain spawn via grain to grain transfers, you'll have enough LC for maybe fifty jars at most. I wasn't calling <i>people</i> who use liquid culture lame, I was referring to the method of squirting spores into sugar water, which should have been obvious.&nbsp; This isn't something new.&nbsp; I've been saying it since I registered here, and was saying the same thing on other boards and the newsgroup ADM long before that.<br />RR","title":"Re: having a hard time grasping why"}}
