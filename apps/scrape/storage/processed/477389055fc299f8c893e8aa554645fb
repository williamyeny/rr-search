My first grow got contaminated during the first flush and I was scared shitless to eat the fruits cause of all the people spreading fear about contam. I ate some and was just fine infact better than fine it was awsome. When this happens to me I use an eye dropper full of peroxide and put a few drops on the infection a day so long as the contam is small and it should keep everything running till its done.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Very bad advice.&nbsp; It's not due to any danger to us that we put contaminated substrates outdoors, because trich isn't dangerous to healthy humans.&nbsp; We move contaminated products outdoors to finish so the trillions of spores don't infect our grow areas.&nbsp; The fruits are fine to eat.<br />RR","title":"Re: what to do with 1% contaminated 99% colonized bulks?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
