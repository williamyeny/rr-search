It slows down and weakens your mushroom mycelium, allowing the faster growing molds to recover before the mushroom mycelium can, and then they take over.<br /><br />Get rid of the aquarium and use rubbermaid type tubs that you can drill holes into all six sides for constant air exchange and circulation.<br /><br />Git rid of the so-called hepa filter blowing contaminants all around the room.  I used to have one of those in every room of my house, and when I removed them, my rate of contamination went way down.  They stir up more contaminants than they filter, then swirl them around in the air, making things worse.<br /><br />In addition, when projects contaminate prior to first flush, especially shortly after birthing, it shows the contaminant was likely in the spawn prior to birthing.  However, your indiscriminate use of peroxide could very likely have weakened the mushroom mycelium enough to allow the contaminants to get a foothold, especially in the stale air of a closed up aquarium.<br /><br />Try to determine if the failed cakes were all from the same syringe or not, to rule out that possibility.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why Does it fail After entering FC?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
