Water will always drip out of a straw log for a day or two, so be sure to keep a tray on the shelf below it so you don't make a mess.  If it was wet down there, that's the reason it's behind.  I don't use bleach 'pasteurization' because bleach kills too many of the beneficial bacteria that we're trying to preserve. We use heat and lime to kill molds and mold spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: straw log help!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
