Highly recommended.<br /><br />It plugs into a standard 120 volt outlet.  I believe the motor can be configured for 240 volt operation if needed.<br /><br />Yes, set it on a table, not the floor.  I use a 30\" X 48\" table which gives plenty of working space.<br /><br />It comes with everything you need, except I recommend caulking around the seal where you install the blower to the hood.  It's fully assembled except for mounting the motor and connecting the power cord.<br /><br />You can see from the picture, it's easy to duct tape a furnace filter over the intake of the blower to serve as a prefilter.  This will greatly increase the HEPA filter life.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-23/838197699-flow_hood_003a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-23/838197699-thumb_flow_hood_003a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Purchasing a Laminar Flow Hood"}}
