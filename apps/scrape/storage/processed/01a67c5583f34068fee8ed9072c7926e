There is always going to be a certain percentage of contaminant spores on any print.  Therefore, if you use more spores, you get more contaminants.<br /><br />In addition, when you use a massive spore inoculation, you force the mycelium to spend a lot of time and energy combining all the genetics into a common network.<br /><br />Many growers think that more spores results in faster colonization.  What it results in is the substrate turning 'white' faster, but there is no evidence at all the project will actually <i>fruit</i> sooner.  I'm a firm believer in using the minimum amount of spores necessary to achieve a crop.  Clear(to the naked eye) syringes perform better than dark syringes.<br /><br />Nobody can see individual spores with their eyeballs.  What you see is clusters of a few thousand that are stuck together.  The spores in the center of these clusters are locked out of the moisture in the jars, so they rarely even get a chance to germinate.<br />RR","title":"Re: How dark are your prints/syringes?"}}
