I mixed 1 cup of brown rice flower, 3 cups of verm and 1 cup of water. I dispensed this into 6 1/2pint jars. Next I put the lids on the jars but kind of loose. Put the jars in a pot (not sitting on the bottom), and boiled for an hour. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />That dumb guide has you doing almost every thing wrong.&nbsp; You've already been told the correct recipe.&nbsp; You don't 'boil' for an hour.&nbsp; You 'vent steam' for 90 minutes.&nbsp; The steam doesn't start to escape from the lid until at least ten minutes after the water starts boiling.&nbsp; When pure steam escapes, start the timer for 90 minutes. Screw the lids down tight. Keep the jars totally elevated out of the water.&nbsp; The steam is what you want in contact with the jars.<br />RR","title":"Re: So, here's what I did, will it work?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
