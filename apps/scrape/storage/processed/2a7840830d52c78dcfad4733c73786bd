I can harvest half that amount in only six weeks.  It helps to hydrate the rye grain with weak coffee for some reason. Sclerotia really forms fast in the presence of coffee.<br /><br />Many growers use grass seed for sclerotia, but I actually get more product from rye berries.<br /><br />Remember, the 2/3 potency is in reference to mexicana fruits, not cubes.  In my experience, gram per gram, fresh sclerotia is double the potency of fresh cubensis, and actually has a fresh, nutty taste that doesn't make you gag.<br /><br />It's also a very pleasant trip with none of the 'freak out' or 'impending doom' feelings so common with cube trips.  They're very spiritual.<br /><br />Below is sclerotia forming on three petri dishes after only two and a half weeks, and the same three dishes two weeks later.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-16/220775821-sclerotia_on_petri_dish_01a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/04-16/220775821-thumb_sclerotia_on_petri_dish_01a.jpg\"></a><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-46/207873314-Mex_a_sclerotia_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-46/207873314-thumb_Mex_a_sclerotia_a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Sclerotia...
