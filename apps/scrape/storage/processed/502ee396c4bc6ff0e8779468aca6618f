Your used coffee grinds make an excellent addition to your substrate/compost mix, but I wouldn't want them exposed to the air and all the falling contaminant spores that constantly land on the surface of our casing layer.  Even if you sterilize the coffee first, it is still an excellent source of food for all fungi, and that includes trichoderma and pennicillium molds, whose spores are floating in the air everywhere in the indoor environment.  Those who succeed with the coffee dunk report very much improved results.  You'll just have to decide if the increased risk of contaminants is worth it.<br />I also see no evidence that caffeine is the precursor chemical.  Coffee has hundreds of chemicals in its makeup, and is high in anti-oxidants.  I suspect it's these that give coffee hydrated grains or compost the boost.  Experiments with plain caffeine have not yielded increased results to the best of my knowlege.<br />RR","title":"Re: hippies caffeine dunk"}}
