For those who don't know, I'm an electrical engineer and computer controls geek.  It's how I make my living.  It would be easy to hook automation sensors and solenoids to every function, especially considering I have a computer with two I/O cards sitting next to my greenhouse.<br />However, My FAE is accomplished by holes cut in the side of the greenhouse, and slits that run from the floor to the ceiling.  My humidifiers are on timers, which require minor adjustments as the seasons and weather changes, but as said, those adjustments are minimal.  Humidistats are nice if you never let spores puke all over the grow area, but if you do, they clog up and ruin the humidistats, thus I switched back to timers a few years ago.<br />In short, the old acronym of KISS applies to mushroom growing as much as anything else.<br />RR","title":"Re: Computer based Green House Monitor??"}}
