I incubate jars on an open shelf at normal indoor room temperature while making absolutely no attempt to shield the jars from ambient room light.  Quart/liter jars of properly prepared and moistened rye berries colonize fully in ten to fourteen days.  I feel it's hardly worth the risk of overheating which stimulates thermotolerant bacteria, to subject jars to a higher temperature than that.<br /><br />If the room you colonize the jars in is very cold, simply put a space heater in there and heat the whole area.  This prevents your colonizing jars from sitting in a box of stagnant air, which is one of the biggest causes of wetspot bacteria next to overtemperature and improper moisture content.<br />RR","title":"Re: problems with bacterial contams in g2g"}}
