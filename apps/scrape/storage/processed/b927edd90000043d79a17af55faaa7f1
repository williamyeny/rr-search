That's why the water in the kettle can be heated to boiling without overheating the substrate or casing material within the jar.  The thermometer is stuck into the center of the jar, but if you think there's more than a ten degree temperature differential within a quart jar of wet material, you're mistaken.  By following my procedure, you'll get perfect pasteurization every time.  Other methods work as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: RR Pasteruization Manure? Not True"}}
