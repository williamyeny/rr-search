Large dishes, as well as glass dishes suck for mycology.  We don't use agar to expand the mycelium so large dishes are worthless.  We use agar to clean up our cultures from contaminants in the two dimensional space of a flat plane.  Therefore, smaller dishes are most effecient because you shouldn't leave a culture growing more than ten days or so on a dish before doing something with it.<br /><br />I use the three and four section dishes because more experiments can be placed on the same dish.  I recommend wrapping with parafilm for gas exchange.  Nothing else I've used to wrap petri dishes delivers the same performance.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-20/787402939-Strain_isolation-third_transfer.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-20/787402939-thumb_Strain_isolation-third_transfer.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-33/605067105-dish_family.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-33/605067105-thumb_dish_family.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Agar Work","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
