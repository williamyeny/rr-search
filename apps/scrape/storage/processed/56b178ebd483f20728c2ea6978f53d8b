That doesn't happen in four days.  Full colonization of the casing layer is not overlay.<br /><br />However, asking for help for your 'casing' does no good whatsoever.  You didn't say what material your casing layer is composed of, nor what substrate is being used.   Much more effective would be to say, \"I need help with my peat-verm casing layer over a horse manure/compost substrate\"<br />RR","title":"Re: Heavily overlayed casings, where should I go from here?"}}
