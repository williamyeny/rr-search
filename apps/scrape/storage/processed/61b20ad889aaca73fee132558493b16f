Think it was like called the Homestead Mushroom kit or something.&nbsp; Anyway, it came with Agar, a petri dish, a test tube filled with birdseed, a sporeprint and a small spore scraper. The instructions were pretty complex back then, though reading through the forums now and watching RR's video makes it look like child's play.&nbsp; Anyway, you had to make the agar, culture the spores on the agar, pressure cook your little (and I mean little) test tube of bird seed, then transfer some mycelium from the agar to the test tube.&nbsp; Then you waited for that to colonize and then you would fruit this little test tube and maybe get 5 or 10 mushrooms if you were lucky. Needless to say, that turned me off growing mushrooms for quite a while.</blockquote><br />Those were the old homestead kits.&nbsp; They were the first real kits which actually worked if someone followed the directions.&nbsp; They were in head shops everywhere in the 80s.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pre PF Tek"}}
