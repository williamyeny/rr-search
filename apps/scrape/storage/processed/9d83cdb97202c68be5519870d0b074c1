Those who've noticed I've been a bit bitchy the last few days now know the reason.  About a week ago, I was laid out with a bad respiratory flu and high fever.  I had a flush of Hypsizygus ulmarium due to be picked(and filmed for the video) but was too sick with fever so left them in the mini greenhouse.  48 hours later, I couldn't breathe, and had what I can only describe as dry pneumonia.  My lungs were completely full of spores and they were literally suffocating me.  My lungs became infected, and I've been laid up for an extra week now trying to recover.  It was the spore load that did it.  I still can't even go into my bedroom/growroom to this day to clean it out and had to move out to the living room to sleep to get away from the spores.  God only knows how many projects I've lost during this week away.<br /><br />Bear in mind, this species drops ten times as many spores as cubes, and the greenhouse was full, but I'll never let that happen again!<br /><br />As said, the amount of spores in a dehydrator won't likely hurt, but be careful of massive spore discharges in your growing area, especially if you're sick already.<br />RR","title":"Re: food dehydrator and spores in the air??"}}
