As Agar said it's all marketing hype and quite frankly, annoying.  It's also irrelevant, since all cubes are the same species.  The reason we made the STRAIN THREAD that's a sticky at the top of the page is to keep these discussions that only distract new growers from cluttering up the forum.  Good luck and welcome to the shroomery.<br />RR","title":"Re: Unkown P.C. Strain - \"Mutant Blue\""}}
