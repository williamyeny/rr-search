There are thousands of mold species floating around in the air and nobody can make a positive ID from a picture.  However, if you properly sterilized the substrate, and have the top of the jar filtered with either dry vermiculite or tyvek, the molds were introduced by improper sterile technique later.<br /><br />I'd suggest burying the contents of those jars outside, or re-sterilizing before you open the jar to clean out the contents.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need Help From A Cobweb Mold Invasion!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
