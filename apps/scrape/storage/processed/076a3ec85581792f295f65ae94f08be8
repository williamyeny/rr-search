Most mushroom mycelium once 'mated' holds two nuclei in each cell.  Note the two cells at the upper right end of the strand.  They both have three nuclei. Disregard the random 'dots'.  This is at very high magnification and those are imperfections in the glass lenses. I've been noticing this a lot with this strain.  It's an albino Aus from Queensland i've been working with, having restored it from dry tissue.  I wonder if the third nucleus has anything to do with the albinoism?  It doesn't manifest in every cell, just in some. <br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-24/059111225-Trikaryotic_mycelium-Aus_Qsl_Albino.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-24/059111225-thumb_Trikaryotic_mycelium-Aus_Qsl_Albino.jpg\"></a>","title":"Trikaryotic mycelium?"}}
