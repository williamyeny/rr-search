If you sit your coolmist on the floor, you pump those contaminants into the greenhouse along with the humidity/moisture to make them grow.<br /><br />Secondly, I'd recommend putting the humidifier inside the greenhouse for best results and longest life.  You'll need a timer, so bite the bullet and get one.  I run my coolmist 1 minute on, then five to seven minutes off to get humidity into the mid 90's.<br /><br />Be sure to leave a flap or two open for air exchange.<br /><br />If you need higher humidity, you can set trays of damp perlite onto all the empty shelf and floor space that you don't have projects sitting on.  As you fill up the greenhouse with projects, the humidity will naturally rise.  You'll just have to get a good hygrometer and tweak your system until it's right.<br />RR","title":"Re: Are casings in a martha enough to raise the rH to 90 if it's at 82?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
