You want near 100% humidity, 70F to 75F temperature, and lots of air exchange.  You can soak your substrate overnight and then return to fruiting conditions, even with pins on it.<br /><br />By lifting your substrate, you should be able to get a feel for moisture content by judging the weight.  This is a learned process, so when you make fresh substrates, see how much they weigh, and then later on you can adjust moisture content based on the feel when you lift one.<br />RR","title":"Re: What could the problem be?"}}
