It does no good at all.  It is normal to dunk in very cold water.  The reason for this is to slow down bacteria growth while the cake/casing is dunking, and therefore dormant and unable to fend off the contamination itself.  Use a tight sealing jar, and it doesn't matter how nasty your refrigerator is.  Just clean the jar before opening.  Some use 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of dunking water, but I just use plain tap water without problems.","title":"Re: Dunk teck, cold shock simultaniously?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
