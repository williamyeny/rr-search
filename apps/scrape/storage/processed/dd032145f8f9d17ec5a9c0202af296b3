I believe with the fans coming on 7 times a day, for whatever length of time I need to set it for, will most likely put FAE as a \"past\" problem. There are enough holes in the plexi lids that with a small computer fan pulling from the outside it should be corrected. Don't you think?<br />&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br /><br />If you're fruiting cakes, use a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium built per the tek</a>.&nbsp; All those fans and stuff will screw up performance.<br />RR<br />","title":"Re: To go nuts and throw it all out, or not?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
