Most 12\" thick filters have lower resistance and are for clean room use.&nbsp; Flow hood filters have higher resistance so they can build static pressure behind them to ensure laminar flow.&nbsp; They're also usually in the 5\" to 7\" thickness range.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this a viable flowhood?"}}
