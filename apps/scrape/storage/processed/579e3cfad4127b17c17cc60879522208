Cloning these does not insure you'll get large fruits next time.<br /><br />That said, large fruits are not desirable.  Smaller fruits have more active product per gram than larger ones, so try to produce larger flushes of smaller fruits.  When cloning, select a young, rapidly growing fruit for best results.  You want a fruit that is rapidly dividing cells, so it will take off quickly on agar.  I prefer to clone from clusters, because they'll tend to produce clusters on future flushes, giving the volume desired, but with smaller and more desirable fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: why clone the biggest fruit?"}}
