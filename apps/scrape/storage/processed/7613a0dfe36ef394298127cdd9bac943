That still doesn't answer the original post though. How many cakes per case 9x11? and how thick should my casing layer be? (bottom and top?) I read somewhere that the bottom should be 1/2\" and the top layer should be upwards of 1\". Is that correct?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Nobody knows what you're asking.<br /><br />You need to read up on terminology.&nbsp; The word 'case' is a verb which means \"to apply a casing layer' over a bulk substrate.&nbsp; It isn't a word for the container you place your bulk substrate and spawn into.<br /><br />In addition, cubensis benefits little from a casing layer, and brf cakes are already 2/3 vermiculite as it is.&nbsp; Fruit cakes as cakes, or if you want to grow bulk, break them up and mix with pasteurized horse manure at a rate of 1 part cake to 3 parts manure.&nbsp; Fruit it uncased.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many cakes per case?"}}
