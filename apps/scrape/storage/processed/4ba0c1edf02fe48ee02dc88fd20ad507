Of course, I have holes in the bottom of the terrarium for the water to escape.  If there has been a contaminant outbreak, I'll pour some water mixed with bleach on first, then let that sit for half an hour before turning on the shower.<br /><br />Before any of the 'conserve water' people jump my ass, bear in mind I live where the more water we use, the less the rivers and reservoirs flood.  If you live in a desert with limited water supplies, simply bleach soak and rinse the perlite if contaminants were present.  Otherwise, simply rehydrate the perlite, drain well and use.  Perlite is a mineral that will last for many years.<br />RR","title":"Re: Re-use of perlite?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
