If you move the jar around, the kernels will roll around until they've been colonized.  In my opinion, that is the perfect moisture level.  If your grains are a bit on the dry side, they'll colonize much faster, and mushroom mycelium will be favored over bacteria.  I'd try using the jars just as they are.
