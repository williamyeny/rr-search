It seems that the cow shits on the grass over spores that were previously deposited there by the wind.  The spores germinate and begin to colonize below the cow patty in the manure enriched soil below.  Remember, it's old and decayed manure pies that you find the fruits on.  Rain has already leached the nutrients from the cow pie into the soil below.  Later when the mycelium reaches the surface, the cow patty acts as the casing layer the mushrooms fruit from.<br /><br />My indoor experiments with straight cow manure produced dismal results unless it was mixed with something else such as worm castings or coir.<br /><br />Horse manure on the other hand will support very nice indoor fruitings even when left uncased.  I believe it's the better choice for indoor growing.<br />RR","title":"Re: is cow as good a horse?"}}
