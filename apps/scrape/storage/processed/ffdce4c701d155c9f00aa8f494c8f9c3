I don't want to take anyone's money until I can offer same day shipping.  The manufacturer just called and said the videos were shipped today, Monday, by 2'nd day air, so I should have them Wednesday.  As soon as I open the box, plop one into the DVD player and see it work, I'll unlock my storefront and take orders.  I have everything set up, just waiting for the disks to arrive.<br /><br />I inoculate in front of a flow hood, by actuall lifting the lid up and dropping in an agar wedge or by g2g.  If your injecting without a flowhood, look in to agar's injection port lids. <a href=\"http://www.natures-resources.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.natures-resources.com<wbr>/</a><br />RR","title":"Re: My rye tek"}}
