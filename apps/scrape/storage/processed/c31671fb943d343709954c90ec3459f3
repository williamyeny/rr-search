It will turn the caps inside out. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />I want to scream every time I hear that.  It's wrong.  Lysol doesn't cause mutations.  I can only catch it so many times, and this Lysol/mutant myth is spreading like a damn virus.  Your new homework assignment is to spray Lysol near(not on) one of your fruiting cakes and report the results.  Lysol is mostly alcohol and isn't good for mushrooms, but using it in the room isn't going to cause mutations.  I spray the face of my flowhood with Lysol prior to transfers, so it's always blowing on something.<br /><br />My guess is the cap was damaged in the primordia stage.  It doesn't look rotten, so I doubt that's it.  If a cap gets damaged by a piece of verm or being touched, it won't heal, but will carry the wound to maturity.<br /><br />The cake also looks dry.  I'd suggest a mid flush mini-dunk in a saucer of water.<br />RR","title":"Re: What would cause this?"}}
