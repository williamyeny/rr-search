In addition, the static electricity can easily wipe out your electronics if you touch them and draw a spark.&nbsp; <br />I've now tested the shotgun terrarium down to 30% humidity, and it still maintained 95% humidity. I won't attempt to test it lower than that because I refuse to live in a house that is drier than that. However, the biggest mistake new growers make is thinking humidity is more important than constant fresh air exchange.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger, and you can always mist to make up for the loss, which is what you're supposed to do.<br />RR","title":"Re: How would you customize this terrarium?"}}
