Never mention cultivation in a thread with a vendor.&nbsp; Spores are sold for microscopy use only.<br /><br />2. You didn't properly pasteurize your substrate and/or casing layer, and that's why you have so many species of competitor fungi.<br /><br />3. Never ask for prints in cultivation.&nbsp; Read the sticky threads at the top of the page.<br /><br />4. Never bump your own thread without waiting the mandatory 24 hours.&nbsp; It's not fair to other patient posters to get their thread bumped down the list.","title":"Re: Cowpoo-native mushis in Goliath grow, no Goliath.
