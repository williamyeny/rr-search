Assuming that jar 1 just contains sterile grain and mushroom mycelium and isn't 25% colonized due to stalling because of a contamination, what is wrong with doing that?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It doesn't work this way.&nbsp; Our grain 'sterilization' is never complete.&nbsp; We have a short window to get the grains colonized.&nbsp; If you G2G partially colonized grains, the uncolonized ones which transfer will be beyond their window before they get colonized with the second batch.<br /><br />You can turn one grain jar into an 18 wheeler load of grain spawn in a few weeks using only fully colonized spawn.&nbsp; I can't imagine needing to produce grain spawn faster than that.<br />RR","title":"Re: G2G Partially Colonized Jars","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
