Well At least there is eddies!&nbsp; I was so&nbsp; Hyped, mycellium running on all plates, and now there trashed. Just my luck, well I guess things could be worse! Oh well, I got to let it go, as long as I am renting it seems, ain't that a bitch!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />If you're tossing out petri dishes because a landlord is coming over, perhaps a visit to a therapist is in order.&nbsp; Paranoia will destroy ya.<br />RR","title":"Re: Active grow, four days in and had to shut it down"}}
