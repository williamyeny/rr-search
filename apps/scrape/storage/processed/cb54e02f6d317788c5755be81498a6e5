Some grow faster at a slightly lower temp.  I.E. Mexicana and (maybe) b+ strain colonize at 82 degrees, and Hawaiian and Amazon colonize quickest at 86 degrees.   <br /><br />there is a chart somewhere on this website. I will try to find the link for ya. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Please don't make shit up.  Cubensis is a <i>species</i> and the various named 'strains' all have the same growing parameters.  Mexicana is a separate, sclerotia producing species.<br /><br />Your jars look fine.  Try to keep them at or below 80F for the best cross between colonization speed and avoidance of contamination.  Let them sit for one full week after full colonization prior to the dunk and roll.  Next time, I think you'll find the 1/2 pint jars perform better.<br />RR","title":"Re: two days later","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
