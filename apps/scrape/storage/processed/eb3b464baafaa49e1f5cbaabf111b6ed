Peroxide breaks down within minutes in the presence of organic material such as a substrate, so is ineffective for an overnight soak.  Rinse the substrates under running water both before and after the soak.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question on dunking without cold shock/refridgeration..","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
