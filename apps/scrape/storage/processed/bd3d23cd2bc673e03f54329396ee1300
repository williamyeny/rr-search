If you 'incubate' at a temperature in the 80's, your project will fruit slightly better at a temperature in the 70's.  However, if you incubate in the 70's, your project will <u>still</u> fruit better in the 70's.  Go figure.  In the summer months in my location my fruiting chamber will regularly go into the 90F temperature ranges during the daytime when the lights are on.  However, I incubate on a shelf at normal room temperature, so they get an INCREASE in temperature at fruiting.  Performance is hardly degraded at all.   Remember, it's common to pick cubes in Florida and Texas during 90F degree weather.  Obviously they don't wait until cooler weather to fruit.<br /><br />Cold shocking is for cold weather, fall fruiting mushrooms.  Mushrooms that fruit during the spring and summer such as cubes and many oyster species do not benefit from a cold shock, and in most cases it delays fruiting.  My best Shiitake strain on the other hand requires two weeks or longer at refrigerator temperatures to fruit well.  My P nameko strain is the same way.  If I fail to cold shock for an extended time, they won't fruit at all, or will fruit poorly.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is cold shocking?"}}
