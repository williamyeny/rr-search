The one nuk1m linked to above is the wrong type though.  You want the coolmist with a spinning impeller, not a filter pad.<br /><br />Put one coolmist near the top and the second one on a center shelf.  Either get a humidistat or set them up to run for three to five minutes every half hour or so.<br /><br />Don't drill holes in the coolmist.  Most come with a two year warranty, but you can't return them if they've been modified.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions on Coolmist construction"}}
