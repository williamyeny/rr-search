I get better luck from casings by exposing them to light from day one.  If you wait until the mycelium is all over the top of the casing, then what is the use of the casing??  I rarely see mycelium on top of the casings.  The pins form below, and pop right on up.  The casing layer provides a moist, humid micro environment, that will induce pinning.  If it's completely colonized by the myc, it can't do its job. ","title":"Re: Hmm..Pinning starting in casing stage?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
