I've used it many times.  It's a bit trickier to get the moisture right than rye berries, but once you do it works like a charm.  It's easy to do 20 to 1 with grain to grain transfers using rye grass seed, and when spawned into bulk substrates, it goes a long way because of all the points of inoculation due to the smaller size.  Adding gypsum when making the jars up is mandatory to prevent clumping.<br /><br />Rye berries should be in any health food store worth a shit.  I've never failed to find it in health food stores.  If you get it in 25 pound bags, you shouldn't pay over 35 cents per pound.  If they don't keep it in stock, simply ask them to order it for you.  The wholesale suppliers to health food stores always have it.<br />RR","title":"Re: rye grain, rye grass seeds, rye berries","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
