The first time you drop the lid, your gauge is going to break off. I keep two blowout plugs, two gauges, two toggle valves for my sterilizers and a brand new nozzle and weight assembly for my AA 921 in stock at all times.&nbsp; I also keep a spare heating element and thermostat for my AA 75X sterilizers.&nbsp; This way, if something breaks, I'm back in operation in minutes, rather than days or weeks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Presto vs AA","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
