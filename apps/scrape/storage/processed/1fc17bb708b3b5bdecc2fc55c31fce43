Not only can they burn, they'll likely flip over your jars.   Use a vegetable steamer, a row of extra jar lid rings, rocks, nuts and bolts, just whatever you have.  The jars should be totally raised up out of the water and covered with foil for best results.  With 1/2 pint jars, I don't allow any part of the water to touch the jars.  With quarts, I allow the water to touch the bottoms, but they're still raised at least 1/2\"/1cm off the bottom.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pressure cooker Q"}}
