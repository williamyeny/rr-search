It would take sixty-four 1/4\" holes to equal the same area as four 1\" holes.  There is also no reason to filter air entering a fruiting chamber.  Massive air exchange is the key to preventing contaminants in a fruiting environment, not filtering.  You filter the lids on spawn jars because they must be kept sterile, but fruiting chambers need not be.<br />RR","title":"Re: Monotub Question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
