You seem to have your terms messed up.<br /><br /><b>Spawn:</b> <i>Noun form: </i> Grains, brf, etc., fully colonized with mushroom mycelium.<br /><br /><b>Spawn:</b>  <i>Verb form:</i>  To mix the above defined colonized grains into a substrate.<br /><br /><b>Substrate:</b>  Manure, compost, coir, coffee grinds, etc.  Substrate is the food the mushroom mycelium eats.  In the case of brf cakes, the brf is both the spawn and the substrate.<br /><br /><b>Casing:</b>  The non-nutritious, moisture-holding layer we place on top of a substrate as a water reservoir to supply the substrate with the extra moisture it needs to support the developing flush of mushrooms.<br /><br /><b>Patching:</b>  Applying a small amount of casing material over the mycelium that is poking through the casing layer.  This allows that mycelium to continue growing, while waiting for more mycelium to reach the surface of the non-patched areas.  This results in a more even pinset.<br /><br />With the above definitions in mind, perhaps you could re-phrase your question?<br />RR","title":"Re: case patching substrate.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
