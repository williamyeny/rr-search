As has been said many times, a 'strain' is two compatible hyphae coming together to exchange genetic information, so it makes little difference how many prints go into making the multispore 'tea'.  The mycelium doesn't give a darn what silly name somebody put on the print or syringe, it's only concerned with A and B mating types, and since all the cube 'strains' are the same species, hyphae from one spore will exchange information readily with hyphae from another compatible spore.<br /><br />Nobody can answer what the offspring will look like because nobody can say that mushrooms from GT will always be 'such and such' but PR's will always be 'this or that'.   I've studied all types of spores under the microscope and I'm here to tell you, these so-called strains floating around with all the fancy names can't be identified either microscopically, or macroscopically from each other.  That's why we stickied the strain thread up on top. It was to keep worthless discussion about 'strain' confined up there so it didn't litter the board with wasted bandwidth.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about spore mixing...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
