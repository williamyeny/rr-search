Fruit size is mostly related to moisture content of the substrate, provided it doesn't waterlog.  constant misting of the casing layer is not advised.  It needs to be misted well, and then allowed to partially dry out before misting again.  There needs to be evaporation of moisture from the casing layer for the mycelium to perform well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Larger Fruits"}}
