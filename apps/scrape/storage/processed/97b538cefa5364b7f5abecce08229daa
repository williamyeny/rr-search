You can install a fitting between the greenhouse and your fans intake to mix in some fresh air, and let the rest recirculate.<br /><br />Agar is correct about not needing that kind of filtration in a fruiting environment.  I have a similar setup, feeding fresh air in the bottom of the greenhouse by my humidifiers, and taking the return air vent out the top of the greenhouse.  The only filter I use is a screen to protect my blower motor bearings from when I fail to harvest in time and clog the system up with spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: Different kind of FAE question"}}
