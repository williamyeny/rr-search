It makes a great spawn.  Most will even fruit on it.  You can inoculate the brf with your culture or spores, and when fully colonized, transfer to supplemented hardwood sawdust/chips for fruiting or spawning to outdoor beds.<br /><br />A slight modification is to replace the vermiculite with an equal amount of hardwood sawdust, but otherwise keep the same brf recipe.  Colonization will be a bit slower than with verm, but you can then use it either as spawn to bulk, or as a fruiting substrate as a way of testing strain isolates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Woodloving: PF cakes vs Shavings"}}
