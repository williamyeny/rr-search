Just make sure the total magnesium content is less than 5%  My friend got this bag at Lowes.  It's less than 1% mg.   If you adjust your casing to a ph of 8-9, the contams won't like it, and the mushies will love it.  If anyone thinks that's a high ph, he sets his straw to a ph of 11, and the mycelium rips through it in 2 weeks or less.  Contams are a thing of the past.<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/032303-8/89949-lime1.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/032303-8/89949-thumb_lime1.jpg\"></a>  ","title":"Re: Who know's what kind of lime is the best????","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
