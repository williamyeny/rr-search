Some strains are non-compatible, but most are. You don't need monokaryons to cross strains.&nbsp; Dikaryons will also cross with other dikaryons and monokaryons, provided they're the same specie.<br /><br />Just toss your spent cakes into the same pile.&nbsp; Some will mix and some won't, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; At least some will fruit if it's still warm enough.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mixed cakes outdoors?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
