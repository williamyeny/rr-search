Straw/manure needs to be used in BULK amounts, measured in gallons or cubic feet, not 1/2 pints.  You don't use straw to spawn to more straw, because it will in all likelyhood turn green before the second batch colonizes.  Follow the teks and learn the ropes, then with the knowledge you'll have, invent your own methods.  That's for the most part what we all do.<br /><br />A tip for the pf tek is to add a tablespoon of gypsum to each basic recipe of 2 cups verm, one cup each of brf and water.  I have about fifty pf jars going now with rice bran instead of rice flour, so I'll report back when they fruit.  So far, they're way ahead and I have several verm/rice bran jars that are fully colonized after only 8 days with inoculation from liquid oyster mycelium, which grows a tad slower than cubes.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: substitutes","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
