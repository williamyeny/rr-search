I used a martha setup for awhile, and am now messing with it again. But all this piping faning is so unecesary. Put the cool mist in the bottom of the martha, get a hygrometer, open the zippers up until you're holding a rh of 97+ all the time, and maybe once a day open the zippers all the way up and flap out the air. I've always had great pinsets this way. The cool mist provides plenty of humidity and fae.
