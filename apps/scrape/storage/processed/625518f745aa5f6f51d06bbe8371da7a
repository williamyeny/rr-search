I will report back and let you know how it goes.<br /><br />It seemed to go well thus far. I actually feel the perlite was able to absorb water more efficiently this way. When I was pouring water on top of the perlite it was growing from absorbing so much water so fast, it was pretty trippy lol I was thinking, \"OH SHIT! It's gonna overflow!\"<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's a waste of time and takes far longer than running water under a faucet through a colander.&nbsp; Perlite doesn't absorb water, nor does it grow or swell up when wet.&nbsp; It's a crystalline substance.&nbsp; Just get it wet and use it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Would it be ok to soak perlite in a bucket of water?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
