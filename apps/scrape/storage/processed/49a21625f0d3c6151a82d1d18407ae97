Many cube growers give up on them, thinking something is wrong.<br /><br />They also prefer a thin substrate such as 1 1/2\" of horse manure.  Peat/verm makes a nice casing layer, but keep it to 1/4\" in thickness.  Wax paper makes a huge difference by helping to keep humidity high right at the surface where pins will form.  Be sure to lift it up every time you fan, and replace it with a clean sheet every two days.   They are also a warmth loving species, so try to keep your FC in an 80F room.<br /><br />They're not hard or difficult in any way.  They just take their time about fruiting, so hang in there.<br />RR","title":"Re: Any tips on substrates for \"Panaeolus Cyanescen\"???","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
