Here are some pics from today Oh. and fyi, I have the windows already covered with cardboard.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Remove the polyfill completely.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger.&nbsp; Mist as required to make up for lost moisture.&nbsp; This will provide best results.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; 73F to 80F is great. They'll fruit fine up to about 90F even. Don't run the AC.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Get the cardboard off the window!&nbsp; Mushrooms require light to develop properly.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; There is no benefit to misting the walls of the terrarium.&nbsp; Mist the substrate.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Get rid of the fan.<br />RR","title":"Re: A little pin porn for you guys, but a couple of question too","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
