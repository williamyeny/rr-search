I was only judging my fae off of the fact that I can see the fog pouring out when it's running but I can't be sure it is enough. I will most likely need more holes. I have plenty of diamond hole saws so it's not a problem to make more. My room is constantly 71-74 degrees so I might just leave it alone. So the difference in fruiting times in only a few days when the temp is not 80? If that's the case, I have no problem waiting a little longer. Thanks everyone<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Run a space heater in the room if you want to keep it at 75F.<br /><br />You never want fog exiting or entering your terrarium.&nbsp; You'll soon learn that if the substrate isn't evaporating moisture, it won't pin.&nbsp; This is why we mist; you let the substrate evaporate and dry out a bit, and then you mist to bring it back up.&nbsp; Steady state moisture content, especially if too wet will lead to poor or no results.<br />RR","title":"Re: need help heating my tank","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
