I also see you didn't add gypsum, which helps to moderate ph swings.  In addition, I have not yet seen a probe type ph tester that was worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell.  They are designed for soil, and just don't perform properly in peat/verm/manure.<br /><br />I get a starting ph of 8 to 8.5 by mixing one teaspoon of hydrated garden lime and two tablespoons of garden gypsum to each cup of dry peat. Mix the peat, lime and gypsum, then add water to approximately field capacity, then set aside.<br /><br />While the peat sits, mix the verm with water in a separate container to approximately field capacity.<br /><br />Now, you can mix the two together and make the final adjustments in moisture content.  Be sure to let it sit for fifteen minutes, then check moisture content again by squeezing a handful of material.  When you hold a handful of the casing mix, no water at all should drip out.  Squeeze a bit, and a small amount will drip out.  Squeeze hard and a small stream will flow out.  This is field capacity.  <br /><br />Pasteurize and use.  For homegrower amounts, a great way to pasteurize is in quart mason jars sitting in a large pot of water.  A pc or large kettle with a tight fitting lid is great for this.  You want the interior of the jars to reach at least 140F for an hour, but not to exceed 170F.  The use of quart jars preserves your ph and moisture content. Good luck<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing PH not Cooperating","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
