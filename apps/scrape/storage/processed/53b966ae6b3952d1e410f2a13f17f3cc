I had 10 jars of this strain (GT) and spawned 9 to coir. All 3 subs smell bad. The last one I didnt use because it just didnt look right. I shook the jars, let them sit for a day or two, and one wasnt showing any good signs, so i left it out. Well, this is that jar today...8 days later.<br /><br /> Keep in mind. I also spawned 10 jars of PE and 10 jars of Koh Samui all colonized in the same batch of birdseed as the GT to the same batch of coir as the GT. The PE and KS are all doing fine. And to be honest, one of the GT subs is doing fine as well. Almost fully colonized, and giving less of the smell. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-15/924666354-CIMG4754.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-15/924666354-thumb_CIMG4754.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-15/924666028-CIMG4753.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-15/924666028-thumb_CIMG4753.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-15/924665681-CIMG4752.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-15/924665681-thumb_CIMG4752.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-15/924665307-CIMG4751.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-15/924665307-thumb_CIMG4751.jpg\"></a><br /><br />im thinking whatever is making this jar look like crap is causing the problems in the spawn run. Can anyone diagnose it? As RR suggested, I have pulled the foil off to let them air out a little. I think they are a bit wet.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Definitely contaminated with bacteria.&nbsp; Notice the melted ice cream look? Some growers describe it as 'grease' around the kernels.&nbsp; That's bacteria.&nbsp; It's why your substrate contaminated with molds too.&nbsp; The bacteria weakened the mycelium enough that the molds could take over.&nbsp; In fact, the molds were probably in the grains all along and you just noticed it when spawned to bulk and they sporulated.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn run - looks good, smells horrible."}}
