A flowhood produces a very gentle stream of airflow at 100 feet per minute or so.  A proper flowhood will bend the flame of a cig lighter, but not blow it out. You work right in front of the flowhood with your work right up next to the filter.  I run the flowhood for an hour or so before I begin work with the door to the room closed.  This cleans the room air very well.<br />RR","title":"Re: question about a flowhood and clean enivroment....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
