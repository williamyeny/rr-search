As much as I hate wal mart, I would never steal from them, nor condone anyone who does.  Don't steal, because there's no worse life form on the planet than a fucking theif.  I've known a lot of theives in my life and if they'll steal from a store, they'll steal from their best friend.  Everyone I've ever known who bragged of stealing, ended up stealing from me when my back was turned, so fuck off.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lost PC rocker...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
