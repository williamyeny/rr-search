Or do you use passive venting? <br /><br />How high is that rock layer on the ground? <br /><br />You don't have problems with mold growing everywhere with that kind of humidity in there?<br /><br />very nice setup. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/><br /></blockquote><br /><br />The black pipe heats up in the sun and creates a lower pressure area which draws air up and out.&nbsp; The white pipe creates a higher pressure area and feeds the container with fresh air.<br /><br />The rocks are 3\" to 4\" thick, with a sloped concrete floor with drains at the low spot below the rocks.<br /><br />No mold at all.&nbsp; There's nothing for it to grow on.<br /><br />Below is a shot just before it was covered up.&nbsp; The tarps and plastic are moisture barriers, and the black and white passive ventilation pipes are visible at the far end.&nbsp; After burial, they were each extended up another 10feet, to place them six feet above finished grade.&nbsp; The back end of the unit is now under almost 10 feet of soil.&nbsp; That's why the temperature stays a steady 58F, which is perfect for fall fruiting cold weather edibles and medicinals.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-21/322691091-Mushroom_house_077a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-21/322691091-thumb_Mushroom_house_077a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: the importance of light"}}
