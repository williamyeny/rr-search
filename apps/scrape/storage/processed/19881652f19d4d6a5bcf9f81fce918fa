As little as a 10C increase in temperature doubles the capacity of the air to hold moisture.  That means if you increased temperature in a sealed container by 10C, the humidity would be cut in half if no additional humidity was added.  However, in a pod with a bubbler going, additional moisture would be added to the air, keeping humidity high because of the expanded capacity of the warmer air.<br />Lowering humidity is not a problem in mushroom growing, getting enough humidity is the battle.<br />RR","title":"Re: How to get humidity low enough?"}}
