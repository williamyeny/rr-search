Our property line borders over 3 million acres of national forest. The mountain behind our cabin in the background is my personal hiking hill all summer and a personal snowboarding mountain all winter.<br /><br />Here's a summer and winter shot.&nbsp; Notice there's not a neighbor in sight.&nbsp; We have the whole mountain to ourselves, and with an endless supply of free firewood right on our own property, we're able to keep it 75F to 80F indoors all winter.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-26/598664941-Empire_Creek_house_1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-26/598664941-thumb_Empire_Creek_house_1a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/08-51/978973919-Home_Dec_19_2008.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/08-51/978973919-thumb_Home_Dec_19_2008.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: If you think it's cold where you live. . ."}}
