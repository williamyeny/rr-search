Thanks.<br /><br />It's a good idea to rinse cakes after birthing.  In fact, it's a good idea to rinse cakes before and after each dunk, or if they've been exposed to a high contaminant spore load.  I routinely spray woodchip blocks with high pressure water every few days to keep the trichoderma and other mold spores off.<br /><br />Soap and water is fine to clean out a fruiting chamber.  The danger from mold spores is not so much in the trashing out of the FC, but in the spores that are released elsewhere to stick to your walls, ceilings, carpet, clothes, etc., and then they decide to drop(by the millions) as you're doing sterile work later.<br /><br />Other than possibly releasing a bit of O2, which is of doubtful benefit, I see no reason to use peroxide in the perlite.  Plain tap water is fine.  All you're trying to do is evaporate water into the air, and water that evaporates is by definition, distilled water.<br /><br />Keep it nice please.<br />RR","title":"Re: You are wrong again."}}
