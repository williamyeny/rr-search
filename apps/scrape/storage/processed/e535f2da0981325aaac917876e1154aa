It usually takes 36 to 48 hours after spawning just for the grain kernels to whiten back up.  After this, the jar or bulk substrate is usually fully colonized within another three days or so.  Even if you used a 50% spawn rate, you still have those same 48 hours to wait, then you still have places in your substrate that are nearly the same distance from the spawn as if you had used a 10% ratio, thus full colonization is not substantially faster.  You won't gain more than a day at most.<br />RR","title":"Re: G2G with VERY large amount of spawn","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
