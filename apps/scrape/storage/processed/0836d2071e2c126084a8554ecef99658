No.  It's not dangerous for the coolmists to be in there either.  Remember, inside the coolmist is always at 100%.  I've been running the same two coomists for well over a year now.  When I was piping them in from the outside, I'd change them every couple of months, sometimes sooner.  The motor bushings would fail, then the motor would burn up.  That hasn't been a problem with them inside.<br /><br />In addition, recycling the humid growing room air through the humidifier gives a real increase in humidity over trying to humidify the dry outside room air you're pumping in.  I just found it better to do it the way I described above after many years of trial and error.  <br /><br />There's plenty of ways to do it though, and they all work, so just pick one, then next time try a different way until you tweak a system you like.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need opinions on Fresh Air Exchange....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
