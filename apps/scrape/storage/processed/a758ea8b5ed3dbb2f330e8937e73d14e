That's why he says to only use one teaspoon with 15.5 cups of peat, when you're supposed to use hydrated <i>garden</i> lime at the rate of one teaspoon to one cup of peat.  <br /><br />Don't buy your hydrated lime from a concrete, steel manufacturing, or construction supply house.  It is not only exponentially stronger than the hydrated garden lime, it often has other toxins and chemicals in it as well for manufacturing processes.<br /><br />As said, grind your oyster shells to a powder and they'll suffice.  I still prefer hydrated garden lime over other methods however, because it's during the first week or two that you have to worry the most about contaminant spores germinating on your casing.  Once it's colonized, they don't have as much of a chance to ruin your day.  The high ph immediately after spawning or casing doesn't impeded the mycelium much, but prevents germination of acid loving molds such as trichoderma.<br /><br />If you can't find hydrated lime from a sponsor here, Best Hardware stores in the US carry it.  Go to a local store, or go to <a href=\"http://www.doitbest.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.doitbest.com</a> and search their site for hydrated lime.<br />RR","title":"Re: 50/50+ lime replacement","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
