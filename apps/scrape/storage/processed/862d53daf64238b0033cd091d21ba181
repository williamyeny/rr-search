Put it together a tad on the dry side and you'll actually get faster colonization.  You can go a bit less than field capacity.  My method of determining field capacity is to pick up a handful of the moistened manure or casing mix and make sure no water drips out.  If even one drop falls, it's too wet.  Give a gentle squeeze about like a firm handshake, and a couple of drops will fall, but no more.  Give a hard squeeze like you were trying to strangle the stuff, and a small stream flows for a second or two.  Any wetter than that is too wet.<br />RR","title":"Re: mycosupply's dehydrated manure...."}}
