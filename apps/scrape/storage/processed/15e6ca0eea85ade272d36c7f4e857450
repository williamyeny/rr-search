Don't spray anything but water.<br /><br />You can mist lightly now, but be sure to let them dry before you close up the terrarium.  They won't abort unless they sit there wet for an extended time.  If you're worried about it, you can use a syringe to squirt water very carefully between the pins.<br />RR","title":"Re: When can I start misting these again...
