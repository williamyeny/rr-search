We call this process 'consolidation' and it makes for a much better pinset.  Consolidation allows the mycelium to perform this process while still in the jars so they don't dry out before the flush.  Those who birth right at full colonization often end up with dry cakes by the time they flush, which reduces yields.<br /><br />I also use fine verm, and it works fine.  In fact, it holds a bit more water than course verm, and the mycelium seems to colonize it just fine.  It's also better for use as the contaminant barrier on top.<br /><br />Your cake is bluing a bit so it's too dry.  You can pour some water directly onto the bowl shaped divot in the top of the cake that was formed by the shape of the jar.  It will take a few hours to soak in, then you can repeat the process, and this should help to hydrate your cake to get it through this flush.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: My first PF Cake (long)"}}
