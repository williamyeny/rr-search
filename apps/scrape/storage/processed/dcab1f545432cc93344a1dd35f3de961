The important thing is if it's too wet after sterilization, don't waste your spores.  Simply start a fresh batch.  <br /><br />The rye should be about twice the original size it was when dry, and it should be fully dry on the outside when you load the jars.  Make sure the only moisture in the grains is IN the grains, not on the surface.  At that point, load your jars.  Inoculate under sterile conditions.<br />RR","title":"Re: Newb going straight to Rye Grain?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
