That's the nature of fungal genetics, and why you never see the old hands arguing about 'strains' or even discussing which one is better. Please use the strain thread stickied at the top for discussion.  Thanks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need fast response about the difference between two strains","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
