I thought that even with the construction of this type of fruiting chamber they say to mist and fan a couple times a day anyway. If that is not correct please let me know because I am about 2 weeks away from birthing(probably). I guess the thing I am now wondering is, is the construction of this chamber suitable for leaving all day without any misting or fanning? And am I just maybe supposed to check it at the end of every day to see if the perlite is dry?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The fan will screw it up.&nbsp; The fact is, you don't even have to 'fan' a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; We recommend such after misting, but it's more for the turbulence(mold prevention) than fresh air which is always being exchanged in a shotgun terrarium.<br /><br />Get a clear terrarium.&nbsp; The colored ones will filter too much light.<br /><br />The perlite gets rehydrated daily whenever you mist your cakes or trays.<br />RR","title":"Re: FRUITING CHAMBER CONSTRUCTION","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
