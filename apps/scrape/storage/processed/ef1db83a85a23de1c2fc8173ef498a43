Other members from here who have switched to 6500K have all reported increases in growth, pin formation, and total weight at harvest.&nbsp; This is now the standard, and it's being used by commercial growers for that reason.&nbsp; One can argue from a point of ego to 'prove somebody wrong' simply because he says so, or one can argue from a point of doing multiple experiments on a daily basis and then freely sharing the results with others.&nbsp; I chose the latter.&nbsp; <br />Sorry to all for the distraction from the troll above.&nbsp; He wanted to get banned like he did last time for puppetry and trolling, and he got his wish. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: question about light"}}
