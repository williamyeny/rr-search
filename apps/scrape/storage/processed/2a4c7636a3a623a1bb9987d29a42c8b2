How can the outside of a cake possibly be fully colonized and the center not???  The greatest area of the cake is around the outside edges.  The distance from the outside to the middle is much smaller.<br /><br />We wait a week after full colonization to allow the mycelium to <i>consolidate</i> its hold on the substrate.  Until that consolidation takes place, the cake will not fruit.  This process will happen faster in the jar than out, and also the substrate isn't drying out during the consolidation phase.<br /><br />Anything you do to 'speed up' the process will slow it down.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can I berth this?"}}
