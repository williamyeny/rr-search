Mix with small chips.  <br /><br />Enoki isn't my favorite edible, but they're fairly easy to grow.  I avoid the refrigerator for cold shocking.  I do have a small one in my lab, but it won't hold large numbers of substrate bags or blocks, so I cold shock outdoors in the winter.  If you're in an extremely cold climate, try the garage or porch, etc., where it stays just above freezing.<br /><br />In the summer, I grow oysters, reishi, hypsizygus ulmarius and others that don't require cold shocking.  When fall/winter rolls around, I can switch to the cold weather edibles.  <br /><br />Check out the gourmet and medicinals forum here.  There's lots of great stuff.<br />RR","title":"Re: not a question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
