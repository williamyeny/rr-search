Lysol is a surface disinfectant that only works on smooth surfaces.  Rubbing alcohol is better imo, so I don't use lysol for anything.   Oust is an air disinfectant.  It has aerosol additives designed to keep the mist in suspension in the air for as long as possible to kill airborne bacteria and mold spores.  Oust rocks.   Lysol makes a similar product to oust and puts it in the same skinny cans like oust, but it doesn't stay in the air nearly as long.  If I fog my grow room with oust, ten minutes later there is still a fog.  Do the same thing with the lysol copycat, and two minutes later the fog is gone.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lysol","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
