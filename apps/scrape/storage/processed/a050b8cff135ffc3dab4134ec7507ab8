By fine grade, I don't mean dust, but roughly 1mm pieces. Colonization speed isn't everything, final fruiting performance is.&nbsp; There is more verm when it's ground fine than course, so it holds more water and provides more nutrition.&nbsp; Less nutritious substrates always colonize faster, such as straw, but you have to use a lot more of it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Okay so is there an EASY way to do this?"}}
