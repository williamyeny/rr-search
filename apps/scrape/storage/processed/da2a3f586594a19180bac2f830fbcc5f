You can get one brand new for under $200, which is only twice the price of the made in china models, and the AA will be something you'll pass down to your grandchildren some day.&nbsp; I guarantee the made in china models will be recycled into beer cans within a few years if you get one of those.&nbsp; That makes the AA the best bargain out there.<br />RR","title":"Re: Thoughts on Pressure Cookers....new or old?"}}
