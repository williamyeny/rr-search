I've done this many times and not had a cross between the two.  It wouldn't be a 'hybrid' if you use two strains of the same species.  If they did 'cross' it would be like a black human and a white human breeding.  The result wouldn't be a sterile 'mule' but simply a cross.   What you'll notice if you do that is you'll have both strains fruiting at the same time or each strain fruiting separately, or one strain will take over the other.  It's fun to do though.<br />RR","title":"Re: mixing strains"}}
