I had to stop growing Hypsizygus ulmarius, the elm oyster due to horrible allergic reactions to the spores.  I only grew them perhaps three or four crops before I couldn't even walk into the house without my lungs seizing up to the point I couldn't breathe, and I don't normally have allergies to anything.  I couldn't even harvest them.  I had to go to a hotel for a few days and sent mrs rabbit to clear out every single elm oyster substrate from my grow area and get rid of them.  I had her start my laminar flow hood, and she left it running for three days before I could enter the house, then we had to shampoo/steam clean the carpets and everything.  So far, that's the only species that has done that to me, fortunately.<br />RR","title":"Re: Inhaling dry, powdered mushrooms - is this hazardous?"}}
