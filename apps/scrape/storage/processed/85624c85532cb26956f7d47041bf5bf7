Turn down the heat as soon as you hear the slight hissing sound that starts at 13 to 14 psi.  Regulate the stove setting so you barely have enough heat to allow a small amount of steam to escape from under the weight without allowing it to actually rattle, which lets more steam escape.<br /><br />When steam escapes your pc, it wants to escape the bags too.  This explodes the bags from the inside out, then the plain plastic gets against the sides of the PC and melts.  A bag full of substrate won't melt from touching the sides unless you have a gas stove turned up too high and the flame is wrapping around the bottom and up the sides.<br /><br />The other thing to remember with bags is at the end of the cycle, reduce heat slowly so the PC cools very slowly.   I do it in several steps to avoid the bags blowing out.  If the PC cools too fast, the internal bag temperature is still high and under pressure, so they have a tendency to blow out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hell is a place in my pressure cooker."}}
