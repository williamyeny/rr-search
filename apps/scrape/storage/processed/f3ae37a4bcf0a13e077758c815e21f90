The figure of 3.6VA means that at 3 volts, you'll have 1.2 amps available, but at 12 volts, it will only deliver between 1/4 and 1/3 amp, which at 12 volts, isn't much.  If you want a 12 volt power supply, I'd suggest an inexpensive automotive battery charger.  You can get a 2 amp battery charger for $20.<br /><br />You'll also want it on a timer or it will dry out your fruiting chamber. I wouldn't run it more than one minute per hour if you're using a terrarium type setup.  You can also get those small electronic/computer cooling fans in 120 volt configuration from Radio Shack.<br /><br />You might have as good a result by simply leaving the lid of your FC cracked so it doesn't seal tight.  This will give constant air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hard drive fan question"}}
