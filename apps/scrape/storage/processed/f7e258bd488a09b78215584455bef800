If it were, they wouldn't fruit in Texas and Florida in the summertime.  In addition, I've colonized jars at one temperature, and then fruited ten or more degrees warmer.  They fruit just as well, although obviously more misting is required at higher temperatures.<br /><br />They'll fruit just fine into the 90's.  The problem is the fruits will grow so fast, they'll be lacking somewhat in quality.  Mushrooms that fruit in cooler weather are denser and heavier.<br />RR","title":"Re: bring temp down????","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
