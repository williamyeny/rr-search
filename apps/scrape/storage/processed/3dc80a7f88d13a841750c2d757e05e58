It's always better to keep it simple.  If your humidifier craps out while you're at work, the cakes could suffocate by the time you get home, or at least have an increased chance of molding.  A hundred or two holes in the terrarium provides for constant FAE, and three to five inches of perlite provides for plenty of humidity.  Save the humidifier for when you build a mini-greenhouse.<br /><br />You can see my terrarium tek on YouTube or at Yahoo here: <a href=\"http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=549451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://video.yahoo.com/video/pla<wbr>y?vid=549451</a><br />RR","title":"Re: stacking my cakes!!"}}
