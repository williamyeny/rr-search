Getting ready to set up a casing tomorrow. I remember doing a 50/50 casing of soil and verm a couple months back. To sterilize the soil (fresh from my backyard) I used some tek where u put it in the microwave for so long and wait a bit to cool off and its sterile. It worked like a charm, but now I cant find the tek anywhere.<img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif\" alt=\":frown:\" title=\":frown:\"/> If anyone knows about it please redirect me, or if u have ur own little casing sterilizing tek lemme know! <br /><br />&nbsp;  Its been so long, do u sterilize the verm for a casing? I cant remember.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Verm is mineral so there's no harm from sterilizing it.&nbsp; An oven works fine.&nbsp; Bake it on a cookie sheet at 350 for half an hour or so.&nbsp; The only purpose is to kill off any mold spores that may have landed on it since the manufacturing process, which uses extreme heat.<br /><br />There's little to be gained from breaking up and casing BRF cakes, which are 2/3 vermiculite already.&nbsp; Simply fruit them as cakes, or break them up and spawn to a bulk substrate such as manure.&nbsp; Use water to pasteurize or steam to sterilize, not a microwave.&nbsp; Don't sterilize casing or bulk substrate materials.&nbsp; We only sterilize spawn such as brf cakes or grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilize Sunstrate in Microwave","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
