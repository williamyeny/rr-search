When you germinate these spores, the second generation starts.<br /><br />A grain to grain transfer is NOT a generation.<br /><br />Senescence sets in after a few trillion cell divisions.&nbsp; It's got nothing to do with the third grain to grain transfer.&nbsp; If you're using quart jars of rye to expand your grains, we generally recommend no more than three grain to grain transfers, because you want the mycelium still aggressive enough to colonize the bulk substrate and then to fruit well.&nbsp; I've often gone four to five and more grain to grain transfers by having the perfect moisture content so the mycelium grows very fast.&nbsp; Thus, it only colonizes the surface of the grains, and then is transferred after a minimum of cell divisions.<br /><br />Obviously if you're using five gallon buckets for spawn, you'd reach senescence before you got to three grain to grain transfers, and if you're using 1/2 pint jars, you could do many more than three transfers.<br /><br />Liquid culture should be used as an inoculant only.&nbsp; I've never kept an LC longer than a week before using.&nbsp; To attempt to 'grow mycelium' in LC is just plain dumb unless you macerated it first in an Ebebach and then kept it for no more than 5 to 7 days in a flask with a magnetic stirrer.&nbsp; The way noobs around here inject spores into sugar water and then wait for weeks on end to fill a syringe only sets them back, because it's way slower than using grains, AND you don't know if it's contaminated or not until you use it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is there a difference between g2g, lc, and making prints?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
