We use the PC to kill bacterial endospores in grains.  Live bacteria is killed by simple boiling.  Molds such as trichoderma and penicillin are easily killed by temps far below boiling.<br /><br />If you'll simply drop your syringe into a pot of boiling water for ten minutes, it will be good to use.  Suck up a bit of the boiling water into the syringe, swirl it around and squirt it out.  Do this a couple of times, then use.  As stated above, use distilled water (after boiling) to mix your spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: mean green thermal death","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
