I like the Gladware black plastic baking trays.  Mycelium eats through aluminium, often before first flush as you found out.  Nobody seems to know if the aluminum makes its way into the fruits, but better safe than sorry.  In addition, those holes will stimulate pins to form down there where you can't get to them.  After this flush is all picked off, you can dunk and fruit the substrate for the next flush as a cake in a different tray, or even sitting in the FC without a tray.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pick some now to let others grow?
