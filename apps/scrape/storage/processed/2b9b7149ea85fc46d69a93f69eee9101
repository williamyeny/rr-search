You can eat mushrooms off a cake or casing that has trichoderma, aspergillis, cladosporium, pennicillium, etc on it. Don't sniff the spores of any molds, especially black or brown ones, and don't eat mushrooms that are rotten.  Bacteria is what will make you sick, not green mold.  Trich will only ruin your crop.  What you describe is, as stated above metabolyte.  It's perfectly normal.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green mold? Still shrooms though...please help","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
