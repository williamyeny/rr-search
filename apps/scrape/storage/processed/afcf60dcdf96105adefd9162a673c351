It's true that in TMC stamets says \"incubate in total darkness\", but one must remember that mushroom cultivation was still in its infancy when he wrote that book, and he used the best information he had available at the time. You can't fault him for that. Ten years later when he wrote GGMC, he corrected himself and writes that \"light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium, either good or bad\".<br /><br />I've incubated on an open shelf at normal room temperature and normal room lighting for many years and have never had a problem with premature pinning.  If a jar or spawn bag pins before full colonization, it is almost always a sign of contamination in the uncolonized portion, and the natural defense mechanism of the fungi is to reproduce so as to ensure its survival.  You have to remember, we've seen lots of posts from people who have incubated in total darkness and still had premature pinning, then discovered when they opened the jar or bag a horrible smell.  The mycelium was following the orders that evolution has programmed into it to survive.  It wasn't the light.<br /><br />There is a good time to use total darkness however, and it's for the last week or so of casing colonization so that the three main pinning triggers of full colonization, massive reduction in CO2 levels AND light can all be applied at once for maximum bang for the buck when it's time to fruit.  I hope this helps once again to clear up any confusion.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn Bag Positioning"}}
