Contamination problems are cumulative, thus the more exposures your house has had to mold spores, the more likely they are to infect your future crops.<br /><br />When molds form in sealed, sterilized jars, they were introduced at inoculation.  It's either contaminated inoculant, or bad procedure such as failure to flame sterilize between jars.<br /><br />Room temperature colonization works great.  I'd get rid of any incubators and colonize in the open on a shelf.  Temperatures much above 80F stimulate molds and bacteria, while slowing down mushroom mycelium growth.<br />RR","title":"Re: 90% then green"}}
