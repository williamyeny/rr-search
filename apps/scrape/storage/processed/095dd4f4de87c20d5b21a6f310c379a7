It will speed colonization up.  If the mycelium fails to recover after breaking it up, it means the grains were contaminated anyway.  Read up on 'shaking'.  That's what we do with rye grain jars.  I use a bicycle tire to bang the jar against to break it up.  With bags, simply massage the bag between your fingers to break up the clumps and spread them around the bag.<br />RR","title":"Re: water content/colonization time"}}
