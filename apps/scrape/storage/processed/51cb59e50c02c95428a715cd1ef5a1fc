None are very dangerous unless you inhale vast quantities of spores.  These molds are very common in the indoor environment, and that's why they seize our substrates as a source of food.<br /><br />Often, new growers seem to freak out other new growers with tales of 'deadly molds', so take it with a grain of salt.  Just toss them out when you find moldy substrates, but don't get any more worked up by black mold in your jars than you do by the same mold growing on the caulk around your windowsill or bathtub, because that's probably where it came from in the first place, and I don't know of anybody getting killed by taking a bath or looking out the window.<br />RR","title":"Re: Black mold!?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
