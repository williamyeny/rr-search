All molds are dangerous to your crop, so not to be messed with.  I recommend tossing out any cake or casing as soon as molds are discovered.  Brown molds are especially toxic.<br /><br />The question was concerning green molds however, and the safety of eating a mushroom from a substrate or casing that has a green mold on it.  There are no known green molds that are toxic to humans.  That is a fact.  Toxic or not however, I wouldn't eat the green mold itself, and certainly wouldn't eat the cake or other substrate.  The mushroom itself however will be perfectly safe.<br />RR","title":"Re: Safe to eat mushrooms off of a cake with green mold?"}}
