Any idea why?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The only reason one would get a 3rd flush is if he didn't manage fruiting parameters properly on the first two.&nbsp; A substrate will deliver 80% to 90% of total possible output on the first two flushes, with most of that on the first flush if you manage it correctly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Those who brag of 5 or more flushes are only bragging that they don't understand the process and have screwed it up.&nbsp; Ignore them and concentrate on getting all your product on the first flush.&nbsp; Then, move the substrate outdoors and get whatever comes after that, thus freeing up your precious indoor grow space for new substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: 3rd flush stalled.
