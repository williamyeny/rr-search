Strain time is more important than soak time, I promise.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Actually, strain time is irrelevant.&nbsp; Due to molecular adhesion, all the water that will drain off will do so within minutes.&nbsp; After that, the grains just sit there spoiling.<br /><br />It's better to soak for five to twenty-four hours, followed by a boil.&nbsp; After draining the boiling water/grains for a minute or two, shake them in the colander for twenty minutes or so to 'steam off' the excess moisture.&nbsp; This will leave you the perfect moisture content.<br /><br />The endospore vs hydration story is that once hydrated, the endospores are much more susceptible to being killed off by pressure cooking, whether they've germinated or not.&nbsp; Many bacterial endospores once germinated, form new endospores within hours, so long soak times are not necessarily better than shorter times, providing you soak long enough to soften the grains before boiling.&nbsp; Doing so eliminates bursted kernels.&nbsp; Don't forget to rinse the dirt and chaff out of the grains before beginning the soak. Adding a small handful of gypsum to a large pot of soaking grains helps prevent sticking and clumping later.<br /><br />Here's a short <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">text and video clip</a> describing my grain tek.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain Soak Time, Endospores or hydration?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
