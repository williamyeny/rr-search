With multi-spore inoculation, it's a roll of the dice.  BRF cakes are more nutritious than any other method, by the way.  If anyone doubts that, try making a 1/2 pint horse manure cake and see what happens.<br /><br />Substrates such as horse/cow manure, and coir, worm castings, straw, etc., are bulk substates, which means they need to be used in large amounts to be of much benefit.  They can greatly expand the size of your crop when you spawn brf cakes or grains into ten to twenty times as much straw, but they don't impact potency.  If there was a single substrate that would make your mushies more potent, don't you think the experienced growers would be pointing you to it?<br /><br />We recommend horse manure because it has a good texture and can be used by itself with excellent results.  The same holds true for straw.  Coir and worm castings benefit from the addition of a bit of vermiculite to break them up and coffee grinds of course will help any substrate to perform better.  However, they affect the size of the fruits and total yield, not potency.  <br /><br />If you want consistant potency, you'll want to learn strain isolation on agar so you can capture the specific genetics you want, and grow it time and time again, rather than depending on the roll of the dice with multispore inoculation.<br />RR","title":"Re: Potency of the mushies"}}
