Pouring very hot agar into petri dishes is going to cause a huge condensation problem.  Be sure to have your dishes stacked vertically when pouring and cooling, so they are in a stack.  The condensation is caused by having the air in the dish warmer than the air on the outside of the dish.  It is the same principle that causes moisture to form on the inside of your windows during the winter.  By having the dishes in a vertical stack, the warm dish above protects the cover of the dish below from the temperature difference.  <br /><br />If you'll follow the above, within 24 to 48 hours after pouring, all condensation that does form will have been re-absorbed back into the agar.<br /><br />As the mycelium will produce a bit of heat when colonizing, be sure to store colonizing dishes stacked as well to prevent condensation.<br /><br />Also, when using a spore syring to inoculate agar, use only ONE DROP of liquid from the syringe per plate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Moisture in petri dish!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
