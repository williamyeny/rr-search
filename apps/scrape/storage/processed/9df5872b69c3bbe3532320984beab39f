You don't see the experienced growers putting fans in a glovebox because they totally defeat the purpose.  If a sheet of tyvek could do what a $500 flow hood can do, does anyone really think we'd throw away that money?  I've posted teks for a simple glove box many times.  All you need is to cut a couple of arm holes.  You don't even need attached gloves.  Just use tyvek wrist sleeves and latex gloves so you can pull your arm out to flame sterilize on the outside of the box, then stick the red hot needle or scalpel back inside. As soon as your arm fills the opening, the air inside immediately stops moving, and you have a still air glovebox again.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need a good HEPA filter..."}}
