Try again with agar and isolate a few substrains.  I've had the best luck with finding fruiting strains of mexicana by leaving in the petri dish for a month or two.  Sclerotia will form in a petri dish within three weeks if you have a good producer.  Within two to three weeks after that, fruits will form from the slerotia if it's a decent fruiting strain.  At that time, transfer the best fruiting strain on agar over to rye grain or grass seed(I prefer rye berries to grass seed) to a tray and case. Cold shocking is not necessary with the mexicana species.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-10/058927567-Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-10/058927567-thumb_Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Mex A Pajaritos fruiting question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
