Bleach is not effective against fungi. I regularly dip cultures from the wild into ten percent bleach before transferring to agar to kill mold <i>spores</i> and bacteria, but it doesn't harm the live culture.  That's why spraying bleach on the black mold around your bathtub or window sills does nothing.  <br /><br />Iodine is very effective against microbes. When I clone, I wash the whole mushroom with iodine before cutting out a section to transfer, which is then dipped into ten percent bleach. <br /><br />Peroxide will help prevent mold in your humidifiers. Many experienced mycologists also use peroxide to dip cultures before transferring to agar. I prefer not to use it for that purpose except for when transferring dry tissue because of the damage it causes at the cellular level, which the fungi must then recover from.<br /><br />Alcohol is great for cleaning tools, tabletops and gloves before doing sterile work, but you should still flame sterilize scalpels and needles, etc.   A well equipped lab will have a multitude of cleaning agents, as well as <i>at least two fire extinguishers at opposite ends of the working area</i>.  I don't know of any particular one cleaning agent that will do it all.   I hope this helps.<br />RR","title":"Re: Which disinfectant? 10% bleach OR Rubbing Alcohol OR Hydrogen Peroxide?"}}
