That's why coir overlays so bad.  Peat/verm is suitable for casing mix.  Coir is at least as nutritious as cow manure, so imho is not suitable for casing.  The reason some report success with coir 'casing' is because cubes fruit just fine without a casing, although flushes will be better and yields higher with a proper casing layer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coir and Overlay!!!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
