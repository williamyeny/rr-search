No harder than cubes in fact.  One difference is they generally take a bit longer to pin than cubes do, and another is they prefer to fruit in the 80's, so they're great for the summer months when our houses are naturally hotter.<br /><br />In my experience, you want a thin substrate, no more than 2\" thick.  My best results came from 1 1/2\" substrates with a 1/4\" casing layer of peat/verm.  Horse manure is great, but I've also had decent results using composted cow manure out of the bag, mixed with a touch of coir and garden compost.<br /><br />Provide 80F to 90F at fruiting time and keep the humidity very high.  Wax paper helps to lay over the casing layer to keep humidity at the surface high.<br /><br />Personally, I've found the trip from pan cyans to be on the 'dark' side, so I don't do them anymore.<br />RR","title":"Re: I'd like to see a shift of midset on pans in here.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
