You can actually hang it inside the terrarium to create turbulence and constant movement, but if you do this, be sure to use a 12 volt or lower fan, not a line voltage one which would be dangerous at high humidity.<br /><br />I've found with enough holes drilled into a tub, a fan isn't necessary.  Below is a picture of how I make mine.  Four inches of damp perlite in the bottom maintains 95%, even with all those holes on all six sides.  the poor seal around the lid also helps and adds to the fresh air exchange.  Good luck.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/287245516-thumb_Terrarium_2a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Perlite for PFTek","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
