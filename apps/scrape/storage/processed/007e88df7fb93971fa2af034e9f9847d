You can also leave the door cracked open.  Put the humidifier on the floor or a lower shelf so it can shoot up and dissipate, rather than hit the ceiling of the unit.<br />They don't crap out because of humidity. They crap out due to backpressure in the hose, which forces moisture into the motor bearings, ruining them which then burns up the motor due to the extra load.  That's why they're best used inside a greenhouse.  They will also raise the humidity more because they're recycling already humid air, rather than dry air from outside.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidifier goes PFFFZZZZZZZT... poof."}}
