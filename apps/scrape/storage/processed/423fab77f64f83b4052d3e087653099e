Take a look in the grow logs forum of all the growers who are skipping the casing layer and getting equal or better results from fruiting uncased.<br /><br />About the only time a casing layer is required with cubensis is when you're trying to fruit straight grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why case ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
