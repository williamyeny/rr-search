You can't ask questions about each and every thing, when they're already answered in the first 10 pages of threads.  <br /><br />Read, read, and then read some more.   Look what was posted <b>TODAY</b>, that you would see if you read past the first page: <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/6627012#Post6627012\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shroomery.org/forums/<wbr>showflat.php/Number/6627012#Post6<wbr>627012</a><br /><br />And, from 4 days ago: <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/6610766#Post6610766\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shroomery.org/forums/<wbr>showflat.php/Number/6610766#Post6<wbr>610766</a><br /><br />Both of these would come up using the search feature and the word 'vermiculite'.  Good luck to you, but please do your homework before posting questions.  This isn't to you personally, but to everyone.  The boards are getting horribly cluttered with people coming in and asking the exact same questions over and over again because they can't take two hours and read back fifty pages of posts, in which case, nearly every single question they have would be answered.<br />RR","title":"Re: Vermiculite substitute?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
