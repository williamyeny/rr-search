There's only urban myths and they keep getting spread and added to.<br /><br />PE is the exception because of its shape.&nbsp; It's not necessarily more or less potent than any other.&nbsp; I've had plenty of bunk PE too, but they still had the same shape.<br /><br />Enough strain threads.&nbsp; Please use the existing one(s). Thanks.","title":"Re: What strain has the highest potential for potency in ISOLATION."}}
