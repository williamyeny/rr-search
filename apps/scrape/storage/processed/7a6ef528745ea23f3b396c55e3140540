It's the same principle that makes your ears hurt when you dive too deep in a pool or lake.  If a large pot won't fit in your refrigerator, simply change the water every 8 hours or so, giving a short rinse between each batch of water.  The refrigerator just helps to prevent bacteria growth during the dunk, but replacing the water a few times does the same thing.  I put the cakes in a large kettle and then place a heavy glass dinner plate over them, that pushes them deep down in the water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dunking in Ziplock bags","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
