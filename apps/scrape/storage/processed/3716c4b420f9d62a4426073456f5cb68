If temperatures are too low, heat the room it's in.<br /><br />You're confusing 'incubator' and 'terrarium'.  They're for two totally different purposes, neither of which should be at 85F.  That's too warm for incubation, and while cubes will fruit at 85F, they'll fruit just as well at 65 to 75.<br /><br />You don't sterilize the perlite because nothing comes in contact with it.  You simply run water over it, then when it finishes draining, dump the damp, but not wet perlite into the terrarium for humidity.<br /><br />Never birth a cake or other project that is not 100% colonized.<br /><br />Spend a few weeks while you start your next project reading all the posts on the board that concern what you're trying to do so you can learn.
