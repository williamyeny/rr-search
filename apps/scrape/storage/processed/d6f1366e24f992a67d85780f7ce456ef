Spray a small section of what you suspect is cobweb with 3% peroxide straight from the bottle.  If it melts and disappears on contact, it was cobweb(mushroom mycelium might foam up a bit, but won't disappear).  If it <i>was</i> cobweb, you then need to spray down the whole casing layer because cobweb spreads by breaking off tiny mycelial fibers and releasing them to the air currents. You'll need to spray the whole thing to contain the mold.   After spraying, you need to air it out by fanning well until the peroxide is dry.  You can follow that a few minutes later with a plain water mist and again fan well afterward.<br />RR","title":"Re: hydrogen peroxide on casing","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
