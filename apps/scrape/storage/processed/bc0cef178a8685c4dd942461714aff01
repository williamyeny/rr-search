However when successful cloning from large mushrooms, they have the added advantage of being fairly clean because the middle of the stems are not exposed to the air like pins.

It matters not if they've been exposed to the air since the mycelium will outrun any contaminants.&nbsp; You simply take a small wedge from the leading edge of the mycelium and transfer it to a new plate.&nbsp; The P2 plate is the one you use to inoculate grains, not the P1, which will have any contaminants from the original clone.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can you clone a pin?
