By tossing your substrate/casing into the refrigerator, you delayed pinning.  Tropical species don't appreciate cold temperatures when they're trying to fruit.  That's the signal to them that the growing season is over and to go dormant.<br /><br />Second, you need to be fanning several times per day.  It will take at least one air exchange per hour to get decent results.  You won't get that by fanning twice per day.  Cut openings into your fruiting chamber to allow constant air exchange, or fan more often.<br /><br />In addition, don't mix peroxide with your misting water.  Peroxide is seriously toxic to fungi, all fungi.  It damages your mushroom mycelium.  Don't use it as a preventative.  Spray 3% peroxide(the strength it's sold at in the US) directly on cobweb mold you find on casing layers, but it has little other use.<br /><br />Mist several times daily.  You should have enough fresh air exchange that your casing layer begins to dry out and requires several mistings per day.  <br /><br />Lower your temp to 70 to 75F for thicker, meatier fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: cased rye fruiting taking a while","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
