In my video, I demonstrate spawning grains to horse manure on a kitchen counter with ungloved hands.  The countertops were clean, and my hands washed, but there's no need for all that 'sterility' when spawning to bulk. <br /><br />When a bulk substrate contaminates prior to first flush, the problem was in the spawn, not the coir.  You can pasteurize coir and leave it out for two to three weeks before anything evil grows on it.  You have bad spawn/spores or incorrect sterile procedure when doing your initial wbs work.  It's the grains that were contaminated.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green every time what am I doing wrong? phenomenon?"}}
