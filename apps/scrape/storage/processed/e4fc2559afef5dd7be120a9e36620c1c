No strain questions in the forums please.  'Strain' is irrelevant anyway because most aren't strains anyway, but just named as such.  Everytime somebody makes a print, it seems they give it a new name and call it a strain.  That's why we made the strain thread.  Just pick one.  If you're growing cubes, they're all the same species anyway.<br />RR","title":"Re: What strains should i buy (First timer here)"}}
