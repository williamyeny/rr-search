Consider 2/3 full to be maximum.  You need room for the grains to move around when you bang the jar against a tire to break it up.<br /><br />2.  It doesn't look as though you washed the grains before cooking.  Wash the dry grains under a faucet and pour off the wash water until it pours off clean.  It's important to get all that grain dust out that will cause your rye to clump up as though it has glue in it.  I hope it works out for you.  Nothing wrong with the grains though, that isn't a contaminant.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye - is this normal or bacteria?"}}
