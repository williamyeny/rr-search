Yours is commonly called lipstick mold.  If the jar fully overtakes the mold, it 'might' fruit, but don't attempt to spawn to manure.  You'll need to fruit it as a cake or bury in your garden along with some manure.  If you choose to fruit it as a cake, I'd suggest building its own fruiting chamber and keeping it in a shady spot of your garage or yard.  Personally, I wouldn't keep a moldy cake.<br />RR","title":"Re: Contam recovery possible? (with pic)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
