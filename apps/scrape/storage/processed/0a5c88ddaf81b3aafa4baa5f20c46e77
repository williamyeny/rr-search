Also, for pins to form you want a steady rate of evaporation from your casing layer.  If it's soaking wet, it water logs and nothing will fruit.  You can dunk bulk substrates between flushes, but even then, you're going to get roughly 75% of your total harvest on the first flush, so if yours has already flushed twice, you're beating a dead horse.  Sure you can nurse a third and even fourth flush eventually, but the real estate that tray occupies would be better put to use with a new one.  I've had the best yield per square foot per year by flushing twice, then burying the leftovers in the garden.  I get a pleasant surprise after each good rainfall and my grow areas produce very well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need experienced advice on dunking"}}
