It's just a small pf jar, not agar or an agar substitute.  We got rid of the thread rating system.  Anyone could give a thread ratings, and the system got abused to the point that the ratings were useless.<br /><br />If you want to isolate strains, or isolate away from contamination, you need the flat plane of a petri dish, and lots of them.  It takes several transfers to get away from contamination or towards single sector isolated strains, and using jars would be messy and take up a LOT of room.  You also want the mycelium growing on top of the medium, not all the way through it as you get with a thin layer of brf.<br />RR","title":"Re: BRF \"Agar substitute\" tek","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
