If the old slant was contaminated then you could clean up on using a plate, maybe two, and then get a fresh slant. It will may also allow you to gauge its vigour and could possily aid the myc coming out of stasis so the slant will colonise faster.<br /></blockquote><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: why do we let master culture slants solidify at an angle?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
