Right now, it's totally empty and shut down, but I have a lot of substrate bags about ready to be opened up and placed inside.  The more substrates you have in a greenhouse, the easier it is going to be to maintain humidity without a lot of dripping.  As i begin filling mine up, I place black gladware baking trays full of damp perlite onto every bit of shelf space that doesn't have a substrate block sitting on it.<br /><br />Even with all this, a coolmist is required in order to maintain humidity with the massive amount of air exchange I provide.  I wouldn't attempt to use perlite only unless you're there all day to mist every couple of hours.  If you have to leave to work every day, you won't be able to do it.<br /><br />Now, if you're growing oysters or shiitake, they'd be happy, but cubes want a bit higher humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: Perlite humification","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
