I couldn't tell them apart from looking, or performance, from brown rice flour once put into the jars. Today, I drove to Spokane, WA to pick up a few dozen bee hives I bought from a guy who's retiring, and stopped at a feed store to get some other supplies while in the <i>big city</i><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":rolleyes:\" title=\":rolleyes:\"/>&nbsp; They had fifty pound bags of rice bran sold as horse feed supplement, so I bought one.&nbsp; I'll make up a few cakes next week and see how it works.&nbsp; Brans are normally more nutritious than flours since they have the whole enchilada intact instead of just the grain.<br /><br />If it works out, the rice bran was $18 for a fifty pound bag, so it's a hell of a lot cheaper than brown rice and was already ground, although in flakes like oatmeal instead of flour.&nbsp; If it doesn't work well for cakes, at least I know it's a good sawdust supplement for my shiitake blocks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Something more efficient or better for a mushroom than BRF, list included"}}
