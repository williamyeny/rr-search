I am having a hard time figuring out what to get later this year for a pressure cooker. On one hand, I love the AA look and it seems like a sturdy built piece of hardware. The presto cooker is the same size (21.5 quarts or 23 quarts, w/e) but it is literally half the price! Heres a look at the two:<br /><br />ALL AMERICAN 21.5 Quart<br />Price: $220<br /><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fecx.images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F41hC%252BsFPoBL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\"><br /><br />PRESTO 23 Quart<br />Price: $100<br /><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cookingfor.us%2Fcatalog%2Fimages%2Fpressure%2520cookers.jpg\"><br /><br />So my question to you guys is what should I get?? PLease give me some experiences you have had with them both!!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />This is a no-brainer.&nbsp; The AA costs twice as much as the made in china presto, but it lasts twenty times as long, which is a bargain any way you measure value.<br />RR","title":"Re: Presto vs. AA"}}
