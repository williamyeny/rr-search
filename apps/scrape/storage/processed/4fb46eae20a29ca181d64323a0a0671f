Besides, amazon can't seem to keep my dvd in stock anyway.  It sells out within days of their receiving a fresh carton.  They received another shipment Friday, so they should update it to show in stock by Monday or Tuesday.<br /><br />BRF will deliver the most product for the size substrate, bar none.  It's not my choice to grow with, but nobody can deny that pf cakes, which only have a few tablespoons of brf in each jar, produce more mushrooms than any other substrate used at the same amount.<br /><br />Grains require a pressure cooker.  If no pressure cooker, use brf cakes.  Flowers grow on plants.  Flour is ground grain.<br />RR","title":"Re: I just read Psilocybin Handbook, but...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
