I've got a microscope picture of a slide I made by scraping the spores onto the slide with a scalpel.  Almost all have major damage from the sharp edge.<br />If you don't have an inoculating loop, you can easily make one with a piece of wire.  The idea is to gently transfer the spores with the round part of the wire so you don't cut them to shreds.<br />RR","title":"Re: alternitive to a innoc. loop"}}
