I'll be glad when the current LC fad wears off because I think it sets a lot of people back simply injecting spores into a solution and hoping for the best.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of LC, but I'd never consider inoculating an LC unless it was with live, rapidly growing mycelium I had checked with the microscope first.  I think when growers are ready to move up from the pf tek, it would be wise to learn agar skills so they can isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminants in the flat, two dimensional plane of the petri dish.  You simply can't do that in the three dimensional space of a liquid culture.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: LC discoloration","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
