You isolate every single strain you can, and then fruit them all.  While they're fruiting, the 'master' from each strain is in the refrigerator.  After you determine the best performers, you go back to the appropriate masters and get them out.  Those are the ones you transfer to culture slants for long term storage.<br /><br />Rhizomorphic mycelium tends to fruit better than cottony mycelium, but a single swipe of spores on agar is likely to generate fifty or more individual sectors(strains), and half or so of those will be rhizomorphic.  Those are the ones I keep for fruiting, and discard the cottony sectors.<br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation..."}}
