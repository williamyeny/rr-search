If it gets really cold, you might put it in an outdoor tool shed to prevent freezing.&nbsp; Azures/cyans will colonize OK at 45 degrees or so, which will help prevent molds.&nbsp; Once the cardboard begins to colonize, add a small amount of alder sawdust and let that begin to colonize.&nbsp; Only after all that, would I add any chips to the mix.<br /><br />Once all that is colonized, add more sawdust and chips and mix into the soil in the bed.&nbsp; For best results, make the bed in an area with woody stemmed shrubs, such as Rhododendron, which will provide shade and a compatible companion plant.<br />RR","title":"Re: Stem-butt cardboard technique, first timer questions"}}
