You can have 100% humidity in a tub and if the inside and outside temperature are the same, there will be no condensation.<br /><br />6. Misting the sides of a terrarium does nothing but waste water, and if it runs down the sides and into the substrate can lead to contamination.&nbsp; You're supposed to mist the substrate directly since that's where the moisture is needed.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; There's probably more crap posted by noobs without a clue above but that's enough for now.&nbsp; If you have a flashing avatar or signature, get rid of it.&nbsp; That bullshit has no place in a mycology forum.&nbsp; Save that childish crap for OTD or send me a prescription for morphine to alleviate the migraines you intentionally cause.<br />RR","title":"Re: First Grow, Need Fruiting help."}}
