It will cause the filters to become damp and then contaminants can colonize right through them.&nbsp; Colonize jars and spawn bags on an open shelf with adequate air circulation to prevent heat buildup.&nbsp; I don't even allow my 5 pound substrate bags to touch each other.&nbsp; If they do, a hot spot is created that kills the mycelium in that area in each bag.&nbsp; When the bags are opened up, it leaves an uncolonized area that is susceptible to molds.&nbsp; Remember, it's up to 5 degrees hotter in a 1/2 pint jar than outside, even hotter in a quart jar, and up to 20 degrees hotter in a large filter patch bag due to thermogenesis by the mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: incubator humidity at 100%","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
