They also sell for below cost to drive mom and pop businesses under, and then they raise prices once they have the market cornered. Use your local markets and boycott walmart.&nbsp; I haven't stepped foot in one in 20 years, so trust me when I say you can grow mushrooms without those bastards.<br />RR","title":"Re: The best BRF to use for PF tek","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
