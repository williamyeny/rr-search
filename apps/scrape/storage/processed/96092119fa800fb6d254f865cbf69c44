Simply knock on the door at any house that has a horse out back.  I've never been turned away when I show up with a large trash bag and ask for horse manure for my garden.  They're always glad to have somebody haul it off for them.  Dig a hole just big enough to mix the quart jar of rye with two to four quart jars worth of manure. Cover with 1\" of soil and water well.  Do not use miracle grow.  Wood chips would make a nice mulch on top to keep the area shaded, but not necessary.  Put in the shade.  If you're in the northern hemisphere, it might be too late however, as winter is fast approaching. Here's a picture of one of my outdoor grows from this summer.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-40/863121642-Redboy_1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-40/863121642-thumb_Redboy_1a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Help noob outside grow","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
