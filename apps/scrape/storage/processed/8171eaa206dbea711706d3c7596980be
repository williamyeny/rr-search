For cloning, you can have far better results by dipping tissue into iodine before placing on agar.  Gentmycin sulphate added to the agar will help prevent bacteria from growing, while not slowing down the mushroom mycelium at all.  In all cases, strict attention to sterile procedure will outperform peroxide.
