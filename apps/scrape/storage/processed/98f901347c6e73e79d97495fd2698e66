Healthy, fresh spores will begin to germinate within 20 minutes of being placed into grains or agar.<br /><br />What hasn't ever been reported is nice flushes from very dark syringes.  Any time you have thousands of substrains, at least a few will be non-compatible and won't merge into a single organism, which inhibits fruiting.<br /><br />In addition, since no print is completely sterile, the more spores, the more contaminants that go along for the ride, thus often the contamination rates are higher.<br /><br />However, even a dark syringe shouldn't turn totally black, and none should have gravel.  If there's no sectoring, it's likely that it was a culture syringe, as you suspect.<br />RR","title":"Re: LC bought online?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
