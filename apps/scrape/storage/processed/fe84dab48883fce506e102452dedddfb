Pint jars perform poorly in most cases.  If you want more substrate, you can stack two cakes after colonization and the dunk and roll.<br /><br />You're also supposed to remove the foil after sterilization.<br /><br />The fruiting chamber need not be in a sterile or extremely clean location.  Fully colonized cakes are resistant to most contaminants.<br /><br />They look OK, but you have them too warm.  Reduce temperature to normal room temp and you'll see fewer metabolites.  There's up to a ten degree inrease in temperature within the jars, so you're at 90+ which slows down growth considerably.  Remember, glass is an insulator, which is why we use it for windows.<br />RR","title":"Re: Beige coloring in the mycelium (first grow)"}}
