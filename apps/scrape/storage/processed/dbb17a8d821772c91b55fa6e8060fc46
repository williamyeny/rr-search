There is no airflow in a glovebox. If you doubt this, light a cigarette lighter inside and watch the flame go straight up.<br /><br />When you set up fruiting chambers, leave the window open for fresh air.&nbsp; You have no need to filter the air from outside during fruiting.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger and also the number one contamination prevention, even if that outside air is full of mold spores.<br /><br />You also don't need an incubator.&nbsp; Colonize your substrates/jars at normal room temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about HEPA and outside air exchange","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
