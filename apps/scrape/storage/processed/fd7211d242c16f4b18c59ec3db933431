A sealed terrarium is the major cause of contamination for new growers.  It's also <b>impossible</b> to have too much humidity.  You want to shoot for 99%.  If your cakes are waterlogged, perhaps it's because you have them sitting directly on the perlite instead of on foil or jar lids to keep them separate from the perlite.<br /><br />Fuzz around the base is perfectly normal, and not a problem.<br /><br />I'd suggest you drill holes all over the terrarium as you see in the picture below, and then use three to five inches of well drained perlite.  Even with all those holes, you should fan a time or two per day.  The thing to remember is that sterility is the key to preventing contamination in jars of grain or brf, but air exchange is the key in fruiting chambers.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/287245516-thumb_Terrarium_2a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Reducing humidity with perlite"}}
