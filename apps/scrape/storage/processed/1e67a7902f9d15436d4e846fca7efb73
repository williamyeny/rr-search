I said I didn't give a shit when I 1st brought up the jack. THEN you tried to say this was all on topic. <br />OK, that's when I started to type my post, while I was typing (and smoking), Blutjager apologized then you decided to follow suit. So by the time I posted my response to your jack denial, you had already said \"my bad\".<br />BTW, This has NOTHING to do with the jack like I keep reiterating. This ONLY has to do with your DENIAL of it. Geez, grow up already.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>Green2whitethumb said:</strong><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b><i>shrooman420 said:</i></b><br />hey man where having a discussion about something you asked about ,on the straw side of the topic ..as far as the poo goes i have never tried it but&nbsp; i have heard nothing but great things but take half your spawn and do it both ways</blockquote><br />Something I asked about?<br />I <b>never</b><u></u> asked about oyster mushrooms, bread bags, straw logs, mono-tubs, laundry baskets, treasure coast, RR TEKS, \"peeking in\" on colonization in progress, or selling edibles.<br />This discussion is NOTHING I asked about. Do you even know what a thread jack is? Look it up. Better yet, look at this thread, its the very definition.<br />Ask someone if they think this is a jack, ask a mod.<br />Like I said in my post, I don't give a shit about the jack (I've jacked threads, before I knew the etiquette) but don't come back and say it didn't happen.</blockquote><br />Obviously, you've already gotten your answer, and you've degenerated your own thread nitpicking.&nbsp; I don't see a thread jack.&nbsp; This is a <b>discussion forum</b>, and I'll I saw was discussion.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wheat straw"}}
