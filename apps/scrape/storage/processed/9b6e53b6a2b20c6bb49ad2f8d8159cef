There is a metal plate above the motor with the holes tapped into it for those screws.  It's a real bitch to line up that plate.   The motor itself is a common 'fart fan' motor available at lowes or home depot, but really not worth the effort to change out unless it's all you can afford.  You can get the motor for $8.<br /><br />Here's the deal.  The hose you're running is creating backpressure which forces mist into the motor bushings, ruining them.  I was going through humidifiers just like you are before I discovered this.  Simply place the humidifier on a shelf in your greenhouse.  It will last a year that way.  However, they have a two year warranty.  As long as you don't drill holes in it, you can return for credit when it fails. The main problem inside the greenhouse is the bushings will get coated with spores and they will also ruin it, but not for a year or so. If it's full of spores, and that is what caused the motor to fail, I'd recommend playing it safe by just tossing it out and buying another though.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cool Mist Lifespan.........____ (Flatline)"}}
