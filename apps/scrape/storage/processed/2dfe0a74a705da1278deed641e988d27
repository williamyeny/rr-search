Many folks report 'overlay' with coir, when what is actually happening is by using coir they've actually added a second substrate layer. Peat is non-nutritious and better suited for use as a casing.  I'd also recommend mixing it 50/50 with verm.  Lime at 5% of the peat by volume if you're using hydrated lime.
