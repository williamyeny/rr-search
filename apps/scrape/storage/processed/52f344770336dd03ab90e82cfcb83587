Thanks, Walmart!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />If it comes from walmart, you know it's going to be shit before the fossil at the door even has a chance to greet you.&nbsp; That's why I haven't stepped foot in a shitmart store since 1982.<br /><br />However, even the expensive digital ones are crap at very high humidity.&nbsp; They use capacitance sensors, and these get shorted out by very high humidity.&nbsp; You need an analog(mechanical) hygrometer.&nbsp; Good luck finding one made in the US or Europe though.&nbsp; Thanks to walmart shoppers, all we now have available is crappy made in china shit that isn't worth the rock required to smash them.<br />RR","title":"Re: This hygrometer..."}}
