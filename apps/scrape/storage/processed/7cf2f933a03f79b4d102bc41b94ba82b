What new growers fail to realize is that the green they see is only the spores that are being released.  The trichoderma mycelium is white and may permeate the entire substrate.  There is no cutting it out.<br /><br />Some strains of trichoderma are sunlight sensitive, while others are not.  All spores are sunlight sensitive, so placing spores outside in the sunlight will bleach them, making it appear the sun has 'killed' the green mold, when in fact it hasn't.<br /><br />Using bleach or peroxide to kill green mold is a waste of time.  There is nothing that will kill molds and leave your mushroom mycelium alive.<br /><br />The key is to follow sterile procedures at every step of the way, and if/when green molds are spotted, the substrate must be removed at once and placed outside.  Many mold infested projects will recover and fruit if placed into soil in a shady spot.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cure for green mold!"}}
