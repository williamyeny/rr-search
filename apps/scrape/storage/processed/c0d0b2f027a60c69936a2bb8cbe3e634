In fact, last year I raced three US Army Rangers up Mt. Si near Seattle and beat all three of them to the tip of the summit(the 'haystack' for those of you who know) by about 1/4 mile. I don't smoke and never have, and climb mountains weekly.&nbsp; Part of staying healthy is exercise, and the other part is not breaking the parts of us that don't wear out on their own.<br />RR","title":"Re: Verm causes cancer?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
