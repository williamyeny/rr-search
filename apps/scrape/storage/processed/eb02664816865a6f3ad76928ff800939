It's all based on a chart somebody mailed to stamets many years ago showing 86F to be the peak temperature for growth of cubensis on a petri dish, and everybody just accepts it as though Moses carried it down from the mountain on a tablet of stone.<br /><br />However, every single experiment I did to try to duplicate that with extremely accurate temperature monitoring was unable to verify that bogus 86F figure.<br /><br />What I have repeatedly found regardless of strain, is that cubensis colonization remains rather flat from about 75F through 81F.  Beginning at 83F, the rate of growth falls off sharply.  By 86F, growth has slowed down nearly 50% what it was between 75f and 81F.  These experiments were conducted on petri dishes that produce little to no heat because of the very thin layer of mycelium.  In jars, up to several degrees of heat is produced by the colonizing mycelium, so definitely don't go over 80F to 81F if you're looking for maximum rate of growth.<br /><br />Furthermore, bacteria and thermophilic molds such as Mucor, the black pin mold are stimulated by higher temperatures.  Therefore using an incubator set to 86F is certainly favoring bacteria and molds, while slowing down mushroom mycelium growth.<br /><br />Below is a picture of one of my colonization shelves.  It sits in my bedroom at normal room temperature and quart jars of rye berries colonize fully in ten days, and pf jars colonize fully in 14 to 21 days, but usually closer to 14.  How often do we see posts where people have incubators set at 86F, and they're asking why their jars aren't colonized after four to five weeks, and they have large spots of yellow liquid forming?  The liquid is metabolites which the mycelium secretes in response to stress, usually from competitor molds and/or bacteria.  What has happened, is they've slowed down the mycelium while stimulating the competitors.<br /><br />You'll also note from the picture below, none of the jars show any signs of metabolite buildup.  That's because they're colonizing very quickly at normal room temperature.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Stalled PF jars due to dryness -- rescue tek?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
