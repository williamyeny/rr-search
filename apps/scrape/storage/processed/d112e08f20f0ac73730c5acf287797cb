Mushrooms are as different from plants as humans are. In fact, mushrooms are much more closely related to humans than to plants.&nbsp; We're both part of the same super kingdom, <i>Opisthokonta</i>.<br /><br />Mushrooms will grow towards a light because they are deriving energy.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown with insufficient light will be thin, have small caps, and very little weight.&nbsp; The same strain on the same cakes given proper lighting will be large and much heavier.<br />RR","title":"Re: cubensis b+ slow growing long spindly pale mushrooms"}}
