In a few months, I'll make a follow up dvd or even several.  I have enough stuff filmed for 4 or 5 more dvd's.  I had to cut out the basic mycology, microscopy, and contamination sections, as well as a whole section that covered the growing parameters of several species.  I also had to cut out the section on building mini-greenhouses.  There's only so much that will fit on a 120 minute dvd.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycology for retards: multispore / clone basics","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
