Use it right from the bottle in your mister.  Do not dilute.<br /><br />Remember, cobweb spreads by breaking off mycelial fragments and sending them flying in the air.  It's important to spray down the entire surface when combatting cobweb mold, not just the actual mold itself.  The peroxide won't hurt your mycelium as much as the cobweb will, so use it twice a day until the cobweb is gone.<br /><br />Increase air exchange even if it means leaving the tub open for a few days.  Cobweb needs stale air to grow.<br /><br />Don't change tubs.  The size of the tub has nothing to do with whether or not cobweb mold grows.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
