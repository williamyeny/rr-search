The fact is, cubensis will 'pin' with no light at times, if the substrate is fully colonized and the survival instinct says, \"make spores before you die\".   There is absolutely NO reason to keep your colonizing jars in the dark.  During spawn and casing run, a few brief looks won't hurt too much, bur remember that looking drops the CO2 level, and <i>that's</i> a major pinning trigger. <br /><br />I'll move this over to basic cultivation.  It's off topic in advanced mycology.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question regarding Spawn/Casing run & light sensitivity? (moved)"}}
