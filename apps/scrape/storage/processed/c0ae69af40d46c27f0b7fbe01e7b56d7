You want to mix the dry materials together well, then add moisture.  You didn't say what compost material you're using so it's impossible to say how much lime.  Obviously you'd use more lime with coffee grinds than with manure.   Use gypsum at ten percent by volume.<br /><br />You don't need lime in a plain verm casing layer, although verm is probably the poorest choice of material.  Peat/verm works much better.
