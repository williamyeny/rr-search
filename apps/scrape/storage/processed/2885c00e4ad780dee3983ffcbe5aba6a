It's going to flow at an airspeed of about 80-90 feet per minute, while 100 to 120 feet per minute is recommended.  Note it's output is 360 cubic feet per minute spread over 4 square feet.<br /><br />For flowhood use, I'd let it run in a small room at least an hour before beginning work in order to scrub the ambient air clean.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mac 10 Self Powered Hepa as a flowhood?"}}
