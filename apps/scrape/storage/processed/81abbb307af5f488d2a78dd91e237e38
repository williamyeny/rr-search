Get your substrate to field moisture level, then load the jars.  I don't use lids, but just wrap aluminum foil over the top of the jars.  Set them in the pot of COLD water and make sure the water goes at least 2/3 of the way up the jars.  Put a plate with a weight on top if necessary to keep the jars from floating.  Turn on the stove and bring the water to a boil.  Let boil for five minutes, then shut off the stove and put the lid on the pot.  Leave the jars to sit for two hours, then remove and use whenever they cool down.   If you use this procedure, the temperature in the center of the jar will not exceed 160F, but will be above 140 for over an hour.  It works perfectly for me.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's your favorite method for pastuerizing poo?"}}
