We know that with multispore inoculation hundreds and sometimes thousands of strains are created.  I've definitely seen more than one strain manifest itself in the same fruitbody, so by cloning tissue from one of those fruits, sectoring will occur on agar.<br /><br />Cloning a cluster is a quick way to get a great repeat performer, but remember if it does sector, be sure to grow out each sector to determine which one you're really after.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is mycellium taken from a clone mean no more sectoring?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
