The filter disks can be used and re-used thousands of times, so they're the best in my opinion.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with polyfill.  Just don't stuff it too tight into the hole or the gasses can't escape.  If you use 1/4\" holes with polyfill, drill two or three of them because one isn't enough.  Trim the excess with scissors so you don't have polyfill hanging into your grain.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain"}}
