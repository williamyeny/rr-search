First, never use distilled water when making up casings or substrates. They will be far more likely to contaminate. Second, that's too much lime.  A good starting point is one TEAspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  <br /><br />If desired, you can use oyster shells at up to ten percent, but they really don't do much but improve texture, and vermiculite does a better job.
