You should be able to keep your casing closed up for a week to colonize without getting cobweb.  Too low, or too hot a pasteurization temp will result in less resistance to molds, as will too high an incubation temp.  Don't go over 80F.<br /><br />As Agar said, spray with peroxide. You can use the 3% peroxide full strength in your mister.  Cobweb spreads when you disturb it, so don't try to dig it out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Damn I got a spec of cobweb"}}
