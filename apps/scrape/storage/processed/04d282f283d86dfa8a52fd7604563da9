If the tyvek is on the inside of the jars, it's exposed to the moisture from the grains.  A wet filter, regardless of material will contaminate because bacteria and/or molds can colonize right through it.  I recommend synthetic filter disks, and mount them on the outside of the jar, after placing the metal lid down first with two small holes drilled into it, then the filter, then finally the metal ring.  This procedure will keep your filter dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: gtg contaminated without polyfil","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
