One key is to not tighten the wing nuts so tight.  Make them snug, then perhaps 1/8 turn after that.  Remember, these things were made for little old ladies to can peaches with.  They have small, arthritic hands that are not very strong, so the wing nuts are pretty big.  If you're a strong young guy, it's easy to over tighten them, making the lid hard to get off. As said above, be sure to use a bit of Vaseline on the seal.  Don't use much. Just a bead about the size of a kernel of corn on your finger is enough to coat the surface.<br />RR","title":"Re: AA 930 lid stuck","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
