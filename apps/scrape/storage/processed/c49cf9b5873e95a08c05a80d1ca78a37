You can also set the mister to 'stream' instead of mist, and carefully get down close and ease the water out between the pins.  Doing it this way, you can soak the casing layer, and it will be absorbed over the next several hours, when you can repeat until you get the moisture to optimum.<br /><br />Remember, the only harm is if the fruits themselves get wet, and are then sealed up in a tight box.  Get them wet all you want(gently) but dry out afterward.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pins to mature shrooms, how long?"}}
