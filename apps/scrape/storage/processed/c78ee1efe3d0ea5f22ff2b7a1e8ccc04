Blue mold is penicillium, which blue cheese salad dressing and most antibiotics are based on.  Green molds are trichoderma and apsergillis, both common and floating all over yours and my house, not hurting anybody.  Black molds can be sickening if spores are INHALED.   Don't spread disinformation if you don't know the answeres please.<br />RR","title":"Re: shrooms DUH :] i need info on mold and stuff please.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
