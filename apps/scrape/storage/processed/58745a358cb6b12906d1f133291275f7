However, you said above it's a 'casing'.  Straw is a bulk substrate, and you shouldn't apply a casing until it's fully colonized, if ever.  Straw fruits fine uncased.<br /><br />You also don't sterilize straw, as it's a bulk substrate.  You only want to pasteurize it.  Sterile procedures are for spawn, such as uncolonized grains/brf.
