These two pictures were taken at 30X through a zoom microscope.  They show the actual beads of metabolites being excreted, and the brown/yellow stains in the vicinity of the secretions.<br /><br />For ID purposes vs molds, look at the line between the stained part and the non stained part.  You'll see there is no line of different mycelium types as you would have if mushroom mycelium was running up against a competitor.  What you have here is simply staining and is perfectly normal.<br /><br />An excess of metabolites can point towards bacterial contamination, over-colonization of a substrate, or too high a temperature.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/185359369-Mushroom_metabolites0a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/185359369-thumb_Mushroom_metabolites0a.jpg\"></a>  <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/185359378-Mushroom_metabolites1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/185359378-thumb_Mushroom_metabolites1a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Metabolite pictures/Updated with gill shots and cheilocystidia","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
