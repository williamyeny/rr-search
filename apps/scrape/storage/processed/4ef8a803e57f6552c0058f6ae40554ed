I have put it to the test, and I succeeded.<br />There was NO sterile technique. <br />There was NO agar.<br />There was NO grain.<br />There was NO Pressure Cooking.<br />There was NO oven heating.<br />And yet I succeeded. I am now the proud owner of a storage box with 15 liters bright white, strongly rhizomorphic Psilocybe cyanescens mycelium, with that special mycelial odor I have come to love so much.<br />What did I do?<br />--------------------------------<wbr>---------------------------------<wbr>---<br /><u><b>WOODLOVER SMOOTHIE TEK</b></u><br />1..soak the right kinds of dried woodchips in desinfecting water for three hours. <br />You can prepare this solution easily by adding 100ml household bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite without additives) to 10 liters of water. Don't worry, it's what they use in swimming pools and in commercial edible mushroom cultivation. <br />2..leach the woodchips for several hours to get rid of excess moisture.<br />3..take fresh woodlover mushrooms, add ten parts of water and blenderize it to a \"woodlover smoothie\". Your goal is to create a suspension of very fine mycelium bits and spores in the water, so blenderize for a full minute, even when the job seems done in 15 seconds. You are creating a very heavy mycelial inoculant in a liquid that has as much spores as spore syringe fluid. I used 30gr fresh Psilocybe cyanescens mushrooms in 300ml water to inoculate 15 liters of soaked woodchips.<br />4..spread out the woodchips and sprinkle the mycelial solution over it, turning it regularly with very clean hands or gloves. Your goal is to get a dab of the mycelium/spore inoculant on every bit of wood. When you are done, keep mixing up the woodchips because the inoculated chips will rub off mycelium onto the untreated chips. <br />5..put the woodchips into a plastic storage box and cover it with a sheet of plastic which you fasten with clothespins. It should breathe, but not let dust fall in. Store this in the dark at room temperature. The woodchips will colonize in the usual time of a spawn inoculation.<br />There you have it! With woodlover mushrooms you collect in the wild you can very easily create loads upon loads of mycelium. Once the mycelium has colonized the woodchips, you can use one part of this spawn to inoculate five parts of moistened woodchips.<br />A couple of small woodlover mushrooms inoculate a storage box, a storage box inoculates a thrashcan and a thrashcan full of spawn can be used to inoculate several gardens and wild patches. <br />This TEK can be used on any scale. You can inoculate a few jars with one tiny mushroom you found, or load up a supersoaker water gun and guerilla-inoculate a whole mulched park <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/grin.gif\" alt=\":grin:\" title=\":grin:\"/><br />--------------------------------<wbr>---------------------------------<wbr>-----<br />Low-tech woodlover cultivation: <b>The Woodlover Smoothie TEK</b> </blockquote><br />Thanks for sharing Wiccan!<br />RR","title":"Re: I have thought up and tested a super-easy TEK to grow wood lovers and I want your feedback!"}}
