My own mushroom farm is a combination of daylight spectrum high-wattage CFL and LED light, and my performance/yield per square foot is higher than any other farm I've ever visited.&nbsp; Just because this info wasn't known 30 years ago doesn't mean it isn't known now.&nbsp; A quick search of this board will find thousands of posts where members have switched to brighter, high spectrum lights in the 'daylight' color temperature range and dramatically improved pinsets and finished weight of product.<br />For a small terrarium, the 9 watt CFL spank0r has is sufficient, since it's mounted only a few inches away.&nbsp; Remember, the intensity of light decreases by the square of the distance.&nbsp; If a light is three inches away from an object, and you move it to 6 inches away, only 1/4 the original amount of light will reach that object.&nbsp; A higher wattage lamp allows you to have it farther away, but also uses more power.&nbsp; A lower wattage light will deliver the same performance if it's closer.&nbsp; As I said above, the key is heat.&nbsp; Heat will dry out your terrarium, and interfere with the circulation in a shotgun terrarium, so ensure you're not heating up the terrarium and you'll be golden.<br />Lumen and Lux, and even color temperature may not be the <i>best</i> measure for mushroom growing, but since it's the system in place, it's what we use.&nbsp; Nobody is going to manufacture lights just for us.&nbsp; Learning to use what's available and to adapt the nomenclature for our benefit is what progress is all about.<br />RR","title":"Re: CFL wattage recommendation"}}
