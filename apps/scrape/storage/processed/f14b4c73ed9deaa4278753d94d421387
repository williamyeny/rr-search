Lots of us have tried all sorts of things, and just when we think we're on to something big, the next test done the same way yields a different result.<br /><br />I've seen no evidence that psilocybin is produced in response to stress.<br /><br />I've seen no evidence that psilocybin is produced more or less depending on substrate choice.<br /><br />I have seen evidence that isolated, high potency strains have less variation between fruits.<br /><br />I have seen evidence that smaller mushrooms are more potent than large mushrooms.<br /><br />I have seen evidence that mushrooms grown in colder temperatures are more potent than the same strain grown in warmer temperatures.<br /><br />No magic bullet has been found that can be added which will cause the mushrooms to be more potent.<br />RR","title":"Re: time to get to the bottom of psilocybin","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
