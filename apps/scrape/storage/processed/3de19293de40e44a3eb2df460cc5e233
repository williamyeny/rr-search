You can get them locally in most places, or order a <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">pre-wired line voltage thermostat online</a>.(scroll down to <i>ACF pre-wired thermostat</i> on that page)<br /><br />Every hardware/electrical store in the country will have 'line voltage thermostats' where the ambient temperature switches a set of contacts rated at 120V/240V which will operate the heater without relays.<br /><br />I still say to move the whole operation inside your house and forget the dog and pony show of trying to grow in a shed during winter.&nbsp; There's nothing to be worried about growing oyster mushrooms for food.<br />RR","title":"Re: Easy hi-tec automated greenhouse!
