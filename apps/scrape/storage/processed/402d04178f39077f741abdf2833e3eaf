Under optimal conditions, moisture will be evaporating from the casing layer due to large amounts of air exchange.  This is one of the major pinning triggers.  Since moisture is evaporating even at 99% humidity, you need to mist to replenish it.  Don't expect the humidifiers to do it all.<br />RR","title":"Re: Martha humidity question."}}
