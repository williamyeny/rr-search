That one is a contaminant of agar, and sometimes grain, but not other fungi such as mushrooms.<br /><br />The stories of people dying are bullshit.  Actually, the only stories of people dying from mushrooms are people who ate toxic ones such as death caps thinking they were edibles.  What is toxic is inhaling the spores from certain molds, especially brown ones.  The moral is, don't open a contaminated jar and snort the spores that come out.  <br /><br />As for the so-called 'green molds' common to mushroom culture, none are toxic to healthy humans.  People with AIDS have been known to grow trichoderma and mucor in their lungs, but it came from living in moldy buildings, not mushroom growing.<br /><br />If you overwater and have a soggy, wet mushroom or put fresh ones in plastic bags until they rot, bacteria might be rampant in the fruit, so you'd get a nasty case of food poisoning.  Only eat fresh mushrooms, and toss out any substrate with green or any other color molds. Never open moldy jars before you drop them into boiling water for an hour or two first. If you do that, you'll be fine.  There's no invisible killers that are lurking around to nuke you.<br /><br />We throw out contaminated mushroom substrate to protect out grow area and future crops, not ourselves.<br />RR","title":"Re: can contamination actually kill you?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
