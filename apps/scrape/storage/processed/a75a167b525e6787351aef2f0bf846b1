Cubes can fruit at temps that would fry them during colonization.  I've seen them fruiting happily into the mid 90's.  If you're getting any extra heat from your lights, put them on a schedule where they're dark during the day, and give light at night after it cools down.<br />I've hooked an AC unit to my indoor mini-greenhouse because the shiitake and other edibles I grow now prefer temps in the upper 50's to low 60's to fruit well.  With cubes, don't worry about it.<br />RR","title":"Re: cooling down my greenhosue"}}
