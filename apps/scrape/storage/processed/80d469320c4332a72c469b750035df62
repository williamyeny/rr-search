It is NOT SAFE in any way.<br />Besides; sealing the container will force the container within to have a \"low pressure\" within the container, while bring the PC up to pressure will and can sometimes crush the object. </blockquote><br />In 35 years of mushroom growing, I've never crushed a jar in the PC.&nbsp; I'm assuming by 'negative pressure' you actually mean vacuum?&nbsp; If so, jars are built to hold a vacuum.&nbsp; In addition, you're supposed to let the steam pressure in a pressure cooker return to ambient slowly, not all at once.&nbsp; A major cause of cracked jars is people who pop the weight off a PC to vent steam.&nbsp; <br />When you say 'manufacturers instructions', I'm assuming you're referring to canning instructions where you must leave the lids loose so the item being canned can vent steam during the process.&nbsp; That's the correct method for canning.&nbsp; However, we're sterilizing and there's a big difference.&nbsp; We're not pulling a long-term vacuum in our jars for preservation, thus we can seal the lids down tight prior to the PC cycle.&nbsp; In addition, we use jars with holes in the lids and filters which allow for pressure equalization.<br />RR","title":"Re: First-timer making petri dishes"}}
