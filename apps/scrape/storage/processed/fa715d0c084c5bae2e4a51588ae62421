Some folks use a straw or syringe.  Whatever method, the moisture content seems to even out, and the water goes to where it's needed.  Assuming the substrate is fully colonized, the only real way for water to move around is to get pumped by the mycelium.  Since mycelium is composed of long cells that are joined end to end, the individual cells must act as a team to send the water where it's needed.<br /><br />Whether the mycelium 'knows' or 'feels', etc., is currently restricted to philosophy rather than mycology, awaiting proof that may or may not ever come.  Personally, I believe that mycelium is sentient, but that's based on psychic observations rather than scientific ones, thus can't be proved.<br />RR","title":"Re: The internet is a series of tubes... is a mycelium network?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
