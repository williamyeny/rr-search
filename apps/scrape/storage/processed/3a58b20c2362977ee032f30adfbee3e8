The grains are already fully hydrated after a 12 to 24 hour soak, so very little or no additional moisture gets absorbed.  The benefit to boiling is that the grains are steaming hot when poured into the colander to drain.  This way, steam is escaping into the air, drying the surface of the grains as the water is draining out the bottom.  Toss them around a few times in the colander to allow more excess steam to billow off.  After about 20 minutes, the grains should be dry on the surface and ready to load into jars.  After a few cycles, you'll be able to 'read' the moisture content just by looking.  Never be afraid to toss out a batch and start over until you get it right.  Don't waste spores if you think the grains are too wet.<br /><br />Don't forget to rinse the grains very well with hot tap water before you begin the soak.  This removes the dirt and dust that not only make the kernels clump up later, but they also hold excess water that slowly drains by gravity to the bottom of your jars.  Fill your soak kettle up with water and stir it around with the grains, then pour out the dirty water.  Repeat until the water pours off clear.  This simple step will save you new folks a LOT of trouble when working with grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Soaking grains"}}
