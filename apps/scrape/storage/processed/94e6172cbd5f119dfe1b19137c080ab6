Teaching my girlfriend anything is a chore compared to teaching anyone else. I have even been told by others that I have a lot of patients and explain things in great detail. Even been told I should be a teaching! But for some reason my one girlfriend just does not learn very easy. At all. Its so hard but I love her for other reasons. My other girlfriend makes up for what she lacks and vice versa. Someday I will teach her how to grow. She would make a great assistance since we are both on the same wave length.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I think spousal units just don't want to listen to their mates. They confuse 'instruction' with 'bossing them around'.<br /><br />Back in the 1990's I had a flight instruction business, teaching people to fly tailwheel equipped aircraft, with a fleet of classic planes from the 1940s.&nbsp; There was another flight instructor on the field who had been trying to teach his wife to fly for years and she just didn't get it.&nbsp; I had been trying to teach my wife(not the current she-rabbit) to fly too, without success.&nbsp; We traded wives for instruction and sure enough, each taught the others wife to fly without much difficulty.&nbsp;  <br /><br />The only problem was that I was a horny bastard back then and his wife was hot as hell with a similar sex drive.&nbsp; We both ended up getting divorces, and there went the business. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: If I've ripped your head off lately. . ."}}
