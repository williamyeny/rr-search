In the last twenty years we've learned a few things though.  One, as hyphae said is the mycelium metabolytes.  Another is that colonizing mycelium need not be kept in total darkness.  I think Paul fixed that one in GGMM, but I know at his beginners and masters seminars he points that out, and his own incubation rooms filled with hundreds of species, are under 8 to 12 hours per day of fluorescent lighting while work is being done.  That has been my experience as well.  Light doesn't become a significant pinning trigger prior to full colonization and the introduction of fresh air exchange.<br /><br />This one is probably nitpicking, but I don't like the TMC method of preparing grain jars which is add dry grain, add water and a pinch of gypsum, and PC.  We now know that if you'll take the time to rinse the grains very well before cooking, they don't stick and clump up later.<br /><br />There's a couple of others I can't think of now.  Nothing major though.  It's a great reference work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Outdated/not Cubensis info in T.M.C.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
