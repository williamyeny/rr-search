Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  I meant you need to give them 12 hours when fruiting comes.  Sorry if I abbreviated the post a bit.  I've typed it so many times it isn't even funny anymore.<br /><br />If you're going to leave the cakes to fruit as is, you can put them in a dark place for the last few days of colonization if you want, but it isn't necessary.  <br /><br />The main pinning triggers are full colonization, an increase in fresh air that comes with the decrease in CO2 levels, and a steady rate of evaporation from the substrate.  Once those conditions have been met, light becomes a secondary pinning trigger. A few minutes of light will work, but 12/12 has been shown to produce superior product.<br />RR","title":"Re: light or no light?"}}
