The rest of your answers are right on, but with that statement, you are contradicting every experienced grower from here to paul stamets.  The evidence speaks volumes otherwise.<br /><br />1)  I'd suggest an alcohol lamp to sterilize so you won't be anywhere near your kitchen during inoculations.  Kitchens are full of molds and mold producing/carrying foods such as bread and cheese, vegetables, fruits, etc., not to mention all the bacteria that lives and breeds in the sink drain and in all those hard to reach to clean spaces.  There's no need to wipe with alcohol after flaming the syringe.  Wait two or three seconds and inject.  Work in a glovebox of course.<br /><br />2) Colonize and fruit at normal room temperature.  Do not elevate the temperature above 81F in any event.  Light or dark makes no difference during colonization.<br /><br />3) You can dunk in tap water.  There is no need to use distilled or bottled.<br /><br />4) Use bright fluorescent light or place the grow table near a bright window.  Avoid direct sunlight.<br /><br />After your substrate flushes, allow it to sit undisturbed for a few days to a week to 'rest' and dry out, and then dunk and repeat the process.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: New here, just ordered some things, looking for a little advice"}}
