They might help to control smoke and cooking odors in your living room, but don't get an open jar of spawn or a syrnge anywhere near them.<br /><br />For mycology, you need a laminar flow HEPA filter.  The keyword there is laminar flow.  The fungi.com filter linked to above is what I use, and have for years.  The bigger you can afford the better, but the 12 X 24 works great.<br />RR","title":"Re: I need a HEPA filter: Is this OK?"}}
