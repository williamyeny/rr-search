It also looks fairly small for large grain jars, but if you're doing brf tek in 1/2 pints, it will be fine.&nbsp; That's a pretty good price for an electric pressure cooker.&nbsp; Be sure to keep your jars elevated on a shelf out of the water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can temperature reach 250 on an electrical PC?"}}
