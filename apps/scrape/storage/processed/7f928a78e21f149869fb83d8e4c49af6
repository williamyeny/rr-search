My house is hot all summer.  Fruiting continues just fine at up to 85.   In fact, I've incubated jars at 75, then fruited at 85 with no loss of vigor or crappy pinsets.  I sure wouldn't put ice in the FC if the temp is only 80.   Also, back your light away from the FC so it doesn't raise the temps as much.<br />RR","title":"Re: RH drop"}}
