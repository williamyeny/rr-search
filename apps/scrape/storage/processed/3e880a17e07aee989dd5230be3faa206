I've just never found a benefit to having filtered air in a fruiting chamber.  I'm sure if you have very large holes in the tub, you need something to slow down the moisture loss, but it matters little if contaminant spores land on your fully colonized substrates. Your mycelium will eat them for a snack.<br /><br />Air exchange in the fruiting environment will do way more for contaminant control than filtering.<br />RR","title":"Re: premature monotub pinnin"}}
