Peroxide is toxic to fungi, all fungi.  Some can tolerate it better than others, but none 'like it'.<br />Sterile technique is the way to avoid contaminants in mushroom culture.  That can be aided by not incubating at such a high temperature.  I suggest never incubating over 80F, as that stimulates thermophilic molds and bacteria more than the mushroom mycelium, which thrives at lower temperatures also.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mini casing , looking for some tips on this one"}}
