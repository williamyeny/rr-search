They'll still fruit at 70F of course, but they do better at 75F, thus the 5 degree temp drop will degrade performance.  If you colonize at 75F to 80F and give a 20F drop, they will perform quite poorly at 55F to 60F.  Tropical species do <b>NOT</b> respond well to cold shocking.  This has been known and proved for many years.<br />RR","title":"Re: question about the actual CASING...enclosure?!"}}
