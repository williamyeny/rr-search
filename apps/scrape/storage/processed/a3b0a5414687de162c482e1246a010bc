Manure is a bulk substrate and for that reason should be used in BULK.  It is nowhere near as nutritious as BRF or grains.  You can mix brf with twice as much verm and still get large fruits in a 1/2 pint cake.  If you mixed manure with twice as much verm, you'd get little or nothing from a 1/2 pint cake.   That's why we use grains or brf cakes to spawn to a much larger amount of manure.  Even so, the grains or brf make up a very substantial part of the final substrate nutrient content.<br />RR","title":"Re: Round 2 . . . Fight!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
