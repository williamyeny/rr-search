If you don't reach 140F for an hour, pasteurization is not complete, and if you get it too hot, partial sterilization occurs, rendering the substrate susceptible to contamination.<br /><br />In addition, you need to keep the manure sealed from the water or you end up with manure soup.  Search my name and pasteurization tek for the way I suggest.  There is ZERO smell if you're using field aged manure.  I do it in the kitchen and mrs rabbit isn't prone to telling me what I can and can't do in our house.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing in cooler","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
