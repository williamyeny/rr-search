It's barely better than no casing at all.  In addition, you don't put a layer under the substrate.  The casing only goes above.  If you put dry verm below your substrate, it will draw the moisture out that you'd rather have go towards forming mushrooms.<br /><br />If you wish a single ingredient casing, peat moss is superior to plain verm.  A mix of the two with lime added to balance Ph is best.  Many commercial potting mixes are a combination of peat, verm, and lime.  For even better results, add ten percent gypsum by volume to the casing material.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing With Just Vermiculite","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
