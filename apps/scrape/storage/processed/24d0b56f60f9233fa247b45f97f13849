You still haven't clarified that point. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />The cake in a jar is suspended above a pot of boiling water with a lid on it.&nbsp; This creates 100% humidity in the pot above the water and below the lid.&nbsp; This is what allows the substrate in the jar to reach 100C without evaporating all the moisture away.&nbsp; This is why we sometimes have to add water to the boiling pot during the cycle, but not to the jars, since they don't dry out.<br /><br />In your tray in the oven, you have no pot of water surrounding the substrate.&nbsp; The moisture in the tray is all you have, thus by definition when it reaches 210F/100C, all the moisture will be gone due to evaporation.<br /><br />I really can't explain it any clearer.&nbsp; I wish you the best of luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: THE Oven Tek.
