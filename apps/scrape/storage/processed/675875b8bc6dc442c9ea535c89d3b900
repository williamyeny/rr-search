This is a forum for 'Mushroom Cultivation,' not 'Communication Skills.'<br /></blockquote><br />But, that's not the point.&nbsp; The point is by misusing terms, they <i>don't</i> get their point across.<br /><br />If someone makes a grammar mistake(the original poster spelled it correctly), I don't ignore the post.&nbsp; However, if they post something like \"i seen dis shroom in da case dat dont lok rite\", I'm going to ignore it.&nbsp; That's what I meant.<br /><br />In mycology, the word <i>casing</i> is a verb, and describes the act of putting a casing layer on a substrate.&nbsp; If used as a <i>noun</i> it would only describe the top layer placed over the substrate, not the whole thing.&nbsp; The word <i>casing</i> is not an acceptable method to describe a tray with a fruiting 'whatever' in it because it gives no information on what was used, thus nobody can help the person.<br /><br />When terms get misused repeatedly, it doesn't make them 'accepted', it dumbs down the whole population.&nbsp; Most members here are interested in mycology, and <i>P cubensis</i> is a way to start because it's so easy to grow, it's almost foolproof.&nbsp; However, many move on to edibles when they tire of tripping after a few times, thus it helps to learn the proper nomenclature from the start.&nbsp; Those who 'only want a few shrooms to trip off with their buddies' don't usually last very long once they realize it's both hard work, and smart work.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Shroomery needs a Gramar Lesson........"}}
