By inoculating and leaving, if contaminants are present, they'll germinate and get a head start on the slower growing mycelium.  I'd wait until you get back to inoculate.  <br />Often, bacteria and molds will be growing along with the mushroom mycelium, and you'll want to be there to make transfers.  Agar isn't for expanding mycelium, so don't allow a dish to grow fully out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar Question"}}
