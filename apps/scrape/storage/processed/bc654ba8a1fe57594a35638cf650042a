Caps opening early has nothing to do with humidity. There is a 'trusted cultivator' box on the search posts feature to allow you to only return search results from them.<br /><br />You can't 'feel' humidity, and taping over the holes in a shotgun will reduce humidity, not raise it, provided you made it per the tek.&nbsp; Besides, fresh air exchange is the main pinning trigger, and you want all you can get.<br /><br />You didn't mention your misting schedule or if you dunked your cakes before placing in the fc.&nbsp; When caps open on small mushrooms, it's an indication of low substrate moisture content.&nbsp; There is no sign of low humidity on those fruits.&nbsp; I'd suggest putting the cakes into a saucer with some water and let them absorb it overnight.&nbsp; You can also put a tablespoon of vermiculite on top of the cake and soak that, so water soaks in from both directions.<br />RR","title":"Re: Caps opening early (with pictures) - low humidity?"}}
