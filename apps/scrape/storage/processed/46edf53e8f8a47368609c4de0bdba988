Full colonization<br /><br />2.  An increase in air exchange instead of just gas exchange, which suddenly lowers the CO2 levels.<br /><br />3.  Steady, slow evaporation of moisture from the substrate.<br /><br />4.  Light<br /><br />Humidity will aid in primordia formation for the reason that they won't form in very dry air, but it's not really a pinning <i>trigger</i>, per se, but more of a 'helper'.  If it were an actual trigger, they'd pin in the jars because that's where humidity is highest.  Number 3 above indicates a high humidity or the moisture would be evaporating very fast, rather than slowly.<br />RR","title":"Re: Light question for Texas Strain..."}}
