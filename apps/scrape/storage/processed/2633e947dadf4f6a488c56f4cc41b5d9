After spawning the grains or brf or whatever into manure, it's a good idea to cover with foil to keep it in the dark during substrate colonization and casing colonization, then remove the foil for light and sudden air/gas exchange to trigger pinning.   However, I've found no benefit or harm from allowing the grain jars to be exposed to light from day one.  If a few pins form in the grains, it is actually a good thing.  Contrary to popular belief, a few pins in the grains can be spawned right into the manure or straw(or used in grain to grain transfers) and they do not rot or otherwise cause contamination.  There is evidence they actually help to give a faster, more uniform pinset in the eventual flushes.  Stamets believes it's the harmones or other chemical triggers in the pins that do this.<br />RR","title":"Re: incubation and light","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
