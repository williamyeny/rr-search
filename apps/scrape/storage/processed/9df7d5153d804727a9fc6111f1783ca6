The larger the kernels, the fewer fit into a jar, thus the less mycelium will be produced by a given size jar.  Remember, the mycelium colonizes the surface of the grains, so the smaller the grain size, the more surface area.  <br /><br />New growers used to be astounded at how fast a jar of popcorn colonizes.  However, a quart jar of popcorn has far less mycelium in it than a pint of rye or wbs.  Therefore, what seems like fast colonization is actually quite slow.  Popcorn is also much higher in bacterial endospores that survive the pressure cooker.<br /><br />Hominy is also soft.  You don't want a soft, mushy spawn, even if it wasn't packed with salt.  I have no doubt one could grow on hominy, but with so many other superior choices, why bother with something that costs twice or more as much, and is less than half as effective?<br />RR","title":"Re: Hominy Project (can't bump an archive thread)"}}
