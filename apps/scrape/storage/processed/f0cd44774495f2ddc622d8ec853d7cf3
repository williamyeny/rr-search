That's why I changed it out.  Actually, I replaced my nozzle with a brass valve from the auto parts store for radiator drains that I can open and shut tight.  It only cost $3   However, it has to be watched because the only safety feature becomes the rubber blow-out plug and that's not a good thing, so I don't recommend my setup unless you're anal about watching the PC the way I am.  You should have dual redundancy on any safety feature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilizers versus Pcs valves","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
