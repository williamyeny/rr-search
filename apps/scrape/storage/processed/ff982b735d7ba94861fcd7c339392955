Bear in mind, it's just the jelling agent.<br /><br />I've had the best luck bringing back dried fruits by placing in a jar of sterilized distilled water with zero nutrients added. Be sure to use a filter in the lid for fresh air.  It will also help if you have a magnetic stirrer.  It takes about six to eight weeks, and you'll see mycelium growth into the distilled water.  At this time, transfer some of the mycelium to your agar mix to isolate away from any contaminants that may be growing along with it.<br /><br />I use 20 grams agar agar, 20 grams malt dextrose, and 2 grams brewers yeast per liter of water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this the right Agar?"}}
