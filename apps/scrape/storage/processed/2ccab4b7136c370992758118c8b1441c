I don't know why we keep hearing that.  Coir has at least as much nutrition for fungi as cow manure, and comes close to rivaling horse manure.  It will contaminate, but not easily if you pasteurize it properly.  I doubt lc will inoculate coir or manure either one.  You'll need to use your lc to inoculate grains or brf, then spawn that to the coir.<br />RR","title":"Re: how easily can coir contam?"}}
