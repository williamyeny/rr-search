This was in December.  I went back in February, and found he didn't have time to bother with them, so put them out in the garage.  Temps outside were in the teens and twenties, and in the unheated garage, 30's to low 40's.  The jars were fully colonized.  I took them home and they fruited like mad.  Low temps slow things down, but that's all.  I keep master culture slants in the refrigerator for years.<br />RR","title":"Re: BRF jars left outside in under 45 degree's","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
