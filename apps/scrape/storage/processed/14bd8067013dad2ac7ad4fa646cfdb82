Obviously shroom spores have to germinate in more than one way to be able to compete out there.<br /></blockquote><br />Look man, Im putting on my tin foil hat for this one.&nbsp; Post a link to some evidence that this even remotely possible.&nbsp; Id love to read it!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Best cinch the foil down nice and tight because that's how it happens.&nbsp; Cows(not horses) eat the spore covered grass next to growing mushrooms and repeat the process.&nbsp; Many, many wild patches have been initiated by inserting spore prints into a cattle water trough.&nbsp; Don't deny or ridicule that which you don't understand.<br /><br />The same thing happens in the plant kingdom with many birds and mammals eating seeds and then depositing them in their dung elsewhere to sprout and grow.<br />RR","title":"Re: would spores on dung grow?"}}
