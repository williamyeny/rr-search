Period. Commercial mushroom farms see green molds on a daily basis and the FDA has made no requirement that those fruits be thrown away.  Aspergillis flavus is NOT a contaminant of mushroom culture, nor is aspergillis parasiticus or penicillium verrucosum.  Aflatoxins certainly are NOT a byproduct of mushroom cultivation.   A mushroom operation is not a moldy house or air vent.  A mushroom farm is not a bag of feed corn that has sat in a damp barn for a year, then eaten raw. Please do not spread disinformation and fear.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Dangerous contams?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
