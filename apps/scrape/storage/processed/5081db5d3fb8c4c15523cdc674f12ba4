You want to pasteurize it.  PH is extremely important in a casing mix.  The mushroom mycelium doesn't care, and we don't lime our casing mixes for the mushrooms.  Mushrooms will fruit just fine at a ph of 5.5, but that is also the favorite PH for molds such as trichoderma.  The reason we lime our casing mixes at the start to a PH of 7.5 to 8 is because the mushroom mycelium can tolerate the higher PH, but mold spores have a hard time germinating at anything above 7.<br /><br />As suggested above, I'd test the PH.  Most houseplants prefer a PH of 6.5, so that's probably the level it's adjusted to.  You'll want to add a bit more lime, and also some gypsum for best results.<br />RR","title":"Re: Possible Casing Mix?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
