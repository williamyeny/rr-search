If you can't expose to light or place near a window during the daytime, I'd suggest a different hobby until you get your own place.<br /><br />Also, if you plan to grow in a sealed bag, only a few substrains will perform well with the limited fresh air available.  If you're not lucky enough to get one of those substrains from multispore inoculation, your performance will be poor at best.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fruiting with not so much light?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
