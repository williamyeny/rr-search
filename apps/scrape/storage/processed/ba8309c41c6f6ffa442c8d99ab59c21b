Afterwards, use the q tip to rub a bit of the salt paste into the wound.  Bear in mind, this is only to get you through to a harvest if you find tiny spots of mold, smaller than a dime.  Anything bigger than that, toss the project outside to finish up.<br /><br />The paste you make should be thick enough not to run.  You can use salt, baking soda, or hydrated lime.  It's the high ph that kills anything it touches, including contaminant molds and mushroom mycelium, creating a dead zone.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you help","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
