You want to fan much more than once per day.  At least several times per day in fact.  Initiation strategy for pinning calls for very high humidity with massive amounts of air exchange.<br /><br />Air exchange is also very important as you stated for protection from molds such as trichoderma and cobweb.  <br /><br />Mist as required to keep your humidity high, and fan every time you think of it.
