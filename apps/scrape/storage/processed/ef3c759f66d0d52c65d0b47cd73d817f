However, a cost effective/low heat solution is natural daylight fluorescent which comes with a color temperature of 6,500 to 7,500.   Sorry, I haven't tried the 10,000K tubes, but that's getting pretty close to the uv spectrum, and we know that tends to cause problems, especially long term.  Good luck to all.  Don't be afraid to experiment.<br />RR","title":"Re: so do I use a 5000k bulb or a 10000k bulb?"}}
