Other growers use different procedures, but all of them involve getting the grains to the correct moisture content and then sterilizing.<br /><br />Endospores do not need to germinate to be killed.&nbsp; Stinky, fermented grains will have far more endospores than the original dry grain simply because <i>endospore forming bacteria will begin to form new endospores within hours of germination.</i>&nbsp; Simply hydrate the grains before pressure cooking for at least 4 hours.&nbsp; When the grains are hydrated, the hard shell of the endospore is also hydrated, thus it will easily be nuked in the pressure cooker whether it has germinated or not.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you soak WBS for too long?"}}
