You would probably get more or less the same result<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Actually, gravity has everything to do with fruiting. <a href=\"http://anonym.to/?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11541309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Here's a research paper</a> on it for those interested. Mushrooms grow up, opposite gravity.&nbsp; They tend to turn towards the light to orient the caps to absorb as much as possible, but they still want/need the light above and to one side for best results.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown in total darkness will grow straight up.<br /><br />To the OP, not a good idea.&nbsp; Light is a pinning trigger to the mycelium, but we also know that fruits very often form on the opposite side of the cake from where the light hits.&nbsp; Placing the cakes upside down is a good idea for two reasons.&nbsp; One, the divot from the bottom of the jar makes a nice place to drop a spoonful of water now and then to keep the cake hydrated during fruiting.&nbsp; Secondly, with some strains, physical shock seems to be a pinning trigger.&nbsp; This is part of the reason rinsing cakes vigorously under a faucet and then dunk and roll tends to greatly improve performance. Placing a substrate upside down from the orientation it was in during colonization will often improve performance for the same reason, depending on strain.&nbsp; With some of my shiitake strains, I always put them upside down from the way they colonized.&nbsp; With other strains, I don't bother because it doesn't matter.&nbsp; You'll just have to experiment.&nbsp; Bear in mind, I'm speaking of isolates, not multispore inoculated grows.","title":"Re: Fruiting pf cakes upside down?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
