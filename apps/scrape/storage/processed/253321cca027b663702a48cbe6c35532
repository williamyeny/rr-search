They'll be triple the price you can get them for online however.  Wrapping dishes in parafilm is perfect for keep out contaminants and allowing for gas exchange.<br /><br />Shortly after germination, you'll notice divergent lines of mycelium.  Each of these sectors is a 'strain'.  Carefully transfer each to new dishes, and if they sector further, transfer again until you have monocultures of non-sectoring mycelium.  It usually takes three transfers for me to get isolated strains, by transferring pieces no larger than a grain of rice.  I like the three and four section petri dishes shown below for this. <br /><br />Fruit out each and every strain to find the best performer.  One or two of them will usually be far above and beyond average.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-33/605067105-dish_family.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-33/605067105-thumb_dish_family.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Agar Question"}}
