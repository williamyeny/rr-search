Most of the advice I've given in the last decade here is a result of research into edibles which are much harder to grow.&nbsp; The research into pinning properties of edibles has led to advances in mushroom growing which have resulted in far better cubensis flushes than I ever got decades ago when my scanned 35mm pictures were taken. In fact, there will be another major announcement regarding brand new changes to our mushroom farm in the next few months.<br /><br />Light is definitely a pinning trigger, but its effect comes on after full colonization unless someone puts colonizing jars in direct sunlight which will cause early pinning every time.<br /><br />The liner on tubs prevents the fresh air exchange around the edges.&nbsp; However, I'm of mixed opinion on this one.&nbsp; I've seen massive flushes from side mushrooms which easily matched the yield of wall-to-wall flushes on the top surface.&nbsp; If you look at manure in a cow pasture, the cubensis almost always fruit from the edges of the pile, not on top.&nbsp; It seems reaching the edges of the substrate is a natural signal for cubensis to pin, and it seems to want to do it there.<br />RR","title":"Re: when do i pick??","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
