Just wash your table, wash your hands, pasteurize the casing mix and go to work. Wash the trays you're going to use, but you don't need to wipe with alcohol, etc. It never hurts to douse the room with Oust before working, but is optional with casings. Remember, the reason casings contaminate is lack of air exchange, not getting a few trich spores during assembly.<br />RR","title":"Re: caseing contams","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
