You have to mist at least a couple of times daily.  That's why we roll in dry verm.  The verm soaks up the water when you mist, and then slowly supplies it to the mycelium.  A small substrate such as a cake will dry out very fast if you don't stay right on top of moisture control.  As said, I recommend perlite humidification, especially for cakes.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you have too much humidity?"}}
