A fan will not make your jars any cooler at all because there are no sweat glands on glass.<br /><br />Find a cooler spot.  That could be against the concrete floor in the garage or wherever.  Placing your jars on a cookie sheet full of cold tap water should help bring the temp down as well.  You could fill it just before you go to work and by the time the water heats to ambient, you'll be home to change it out with cool water again.  Get creative.  Just try to keep the temp in the low 80's or less.<br /><br />Cubes will actually fruit well in temps that would fry the mycelium in the colonizing stages.  However, quality is better when they fruit at lower temps.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trouble with PF Tek"}}
