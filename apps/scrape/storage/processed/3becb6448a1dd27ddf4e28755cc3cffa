Put your colonizing jars higher.\" (Why is storing them higher a good idea?)<br /></blockquote><br />90% or more of all contaminant spores are within one foot of the floor, according to my particulate counter.&nbsp; This due to gravity.&nbsp; Put tubs and colonizing jars on a shelf to elevate them into 'relatively' cleaner air.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>musclemushies said:</b><br />\"Don't use rye and WBS in the same jar. Choose one or the other.\" (Why should you not mix two types of grains in one substrate?)<br /></blockquote><br />You can mix grains if you like.&nbsp; I prefer rye berries alone because they're easier to hydrate properly if all the grains are the same size and hold the same amount of moisture.&nbsp; However, wbs by definition is a mixture of grains, so adding rye wouldn't hurt.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>musclemushies said:</b><br />\"Make sure there's a fan in the room.\" (How does non-stagnant air help prevent contams?)<br /></blockquote><br />Molds thrive in stale, stagnant air.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium thrives in fresh, circulating air.&nbsp; If you have good circulation in your room, you don't need a fan.&nbsp; If not, get one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sometimes disappointed with quality of authorship on shroomery"}}
