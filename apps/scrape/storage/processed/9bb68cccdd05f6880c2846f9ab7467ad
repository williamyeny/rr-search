It's also harder for the CO2 to escape the larger jars.  Personally, I don't use anything larger than quarts, even though I have five or six cases of half gallon jars in storage.  Try leaving the jars laying on their sides.  Next grow, I'd suggest quarts for grains.<br /><br />In addition, the larger the container, the drier you make the grains.  You'll use about 20% less water(per measure of grain) with half gallons than you'd use with quarts.<br />RR","title":"Re: Half Gallon Rye Grain jars not colonizing correctly..what am I doing wrong?"}}
