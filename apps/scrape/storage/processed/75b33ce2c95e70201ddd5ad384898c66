You're growing a pathogen for gods sake. Just clone a god damn fruit and then you know you have a higher chance of having a good fruiter. I'm thinking the only reason people dick around with agar is to say....I know this, and I know how to do that...blah blah blan...ect. Your shit will fruit just fine, without fucking around with that crap. Also you don't know what type of grower you're isolating until you fruit it. Otherwise your just isolating certain growth characteristics you like. IMO the only people that need to fuck around with agar are spore producers, \"professional\" growers, and really weird hobbyist... And on a side note isolating strains on agar really isn't all that hard nor impressive to do. I was doing that shit in my High School Sciences class, when I was a TA. So I guess if you want to was some time and dick around go for it.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Spoken like someone without a clue.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>ronjohn7779 said:</b><br />I thought the whole point of cultivating was to grow some damn mushrooms and get fucked up with your buddies.

They'll move on to isolate strains, attempt hybridization, and in general treat cultivation as an artform, rather than a chore that must be performed as a means to an end.&nbsp; They'll work twice as hard for a ten percent gain, just for the love of perfection.&nbsp; These are the ones who will isolate strains, not the dumb fucks who treat mushrooms as a drug, or even worse, a pathogen, as if mushrooms cause disease.<br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation on Agar (Why Come?)"}}
