I've posted about this in the sponsors forum a few times already.&nbsp; I'm trying to get a TV station to document the next classroom project.&nbsp; The only problem is from our remote mountain location, we're a three hour drive from the nearest town with broadcast TV.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycology in science class"}}
