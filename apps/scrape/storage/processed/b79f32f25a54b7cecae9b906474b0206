Alcohol doesn't sterilize.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/212212163-Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_004a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-008/212212163-thumb_Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_004a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Orange substance growing on mycelium...?
