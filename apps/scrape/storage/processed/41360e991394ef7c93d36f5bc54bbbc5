It will actually begin to look like rain in there.  That's why you're having so much runoff.  A coolmist is really at it's best if you shoot to maintain 80% to 90%.  Above that and dripping/standing water is going to be a real problem.  I have the exact same model humidifier.  if you'll run it 1 minute on, 5 minutes off, you'll maintain 85% or so with very little to no dripping water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is your cool mist like my cool mist?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
