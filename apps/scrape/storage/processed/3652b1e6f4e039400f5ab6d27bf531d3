Endospore-forming bacteria begin to form new endospores within an hour of germination. In addition, popcorn is the worst possible choice for spawn because it contains so many endospore-forming bacteria.<br /><br />The main function of the soak is to hydrate the grains.&nbsp; While doing this, you also hydrate and soften the endospores, making them easier to kill in the pressure cooker.&nbsp; I also used to buy into the necessity of 'germinating' the endospores, but I no longer feel that's the best course of action.&nbsp; A four hour soak in hot water is plenty.&nbsp; After four hours, not many endospores have germinated, but they're killed in the PC nonetheless.&nbsp; Above 24 hours, you've flooded your soak water and grains with more endospores than you started with, actually increasing your chances of failure.<br />RR","title":"Re: SOAKING WBS - GRAINS & TIMES - FINAL ANSWER","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
