Here's a few of the errors.<br /><br />You boiled the rye, but not the millet?  Then mixed the two?  That gives you two different grains with different levels of hydration.<br /><br />Draining for an hour does nothing.  All the water that will drain out from a batch of rye does so within 1 minute.  The water that is stuck to the surface of the grains, will make them too wet later.  You need to drain after the simmer while the grains are still boiling hot, so you can let the steam dry on the surface.<br /><br />Avoid busted kernels at all costs.  None is best.  If you have more than just a few, do the batch over.  If you've soaked, beginning in HOT tap water, there should be no busted kernels after boiling because they will have softened up.<br /><br />Did you leave the stove on high during the process?  If so, your jars probably puked out all the moisture that was in the grains.  You're supposed to turn down the stove as soon as the weight rattles.  Turn it down so the weight either doesn't rattle at all, or rattles once every few minutes at most.  Every time the weight rattles, moisture leaves the PC, and a corresponding amount of moisture leaves each jar of grains.  That is basic physics.<br /><br />Polyfill is a decent filter, as is tyvek.  Using both will restrict gas exchange.<br /><br />You removed the PC from the stove and brought down the pressure in the bathtub???  That sped up the cooling process, causing even more loss of moisture from the grains.  You're supposed to leave the PC on the stove and simply shut off the burner and walk away.  NEVER do anything to speed up the pressure loss.<br /><br />You DON'T inoculate in open air.  In addition, Lysol is a surface cleaner, not an air cleaner.  Lysol will do nothing to clean the air.  <br /><br />I'm sure with some reading, you can find more mistakes.  Once you correct these, and follow proper procedure, I'm sure you'll have success.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Australian p.cubensis on rye+millet (RR, Agar, Creamcorn, experts! pls help)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
