That's the beauty of antibiotic agar.  Another tip is to use a very small piece of tissue for the transfer.  Remember, the larger the piece you use, the more contaminant spores will be on it.  You can also soak the dry tissue in water for fifteen minutes with bleach added at the rate of two tablespoons per gallon.  This will help to neutralize the bacteria and fungi spores that may be present, while still allowing the mycelium to recover.  Just remember, the VERY first mycelium you see must be transferred to a new petri dish, so have some made up and ready.  The trick is to make a series of transfers until the mycelium has outran the contaminants.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar with Dried Tissue","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
