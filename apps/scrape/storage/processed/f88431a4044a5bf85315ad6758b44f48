Four hours is plenty.  After 30 hours, the bacteria have probably already germinated and produced new endospores, defeating the purpose of the soak.  Whether you soak 4 or 18 or 24 hours probably matters little.  If you soak 24 hours, the grains won't absorb any more water during the boil, but if you only soak 4 hours, they'll finish hydrating in a five to ten minute boil.  Either way, the boil gets them hot so they steam off the moisture on the surface.  Just boil and then shake to steam dry as shown in the video.  Load jars when dry.  The moisture you need is inside the grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Four to Twenty-four hour soak?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
