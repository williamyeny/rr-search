I will sell all of my AA PC's and go with the cheap boys. You are a great help to the community. Congrats pal! I don't think that anyone on this site would not agree that a minimum of 15 PSI is essential to cooking grain EFFICIENTLY. To each his own,shall we move on with helpful information to the community then? Carry on.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Actually, I sterilize rye grain at 1 psi for 8 hours with 100% success.&nbsp; This is only for when I need to do 150 pounds of grain spawn per day though.&nbsp; Otherwise, I make smaller amounts in my AA75X sterilizers.&nbsp; There is no law that says grains need to be sterilized at 15 psi.&nbsp; I've proved otherwise.&nbsp; You can even sterilize them brf tek style for 8 hours on the stovetop.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pressure Cooker Advice","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
