Four days ago you had a jar that was two days old from spores and fully colonized with fuzzy, non-rhizomorphic mycelium that looked just like mold.  You poured peroxide into the jar and it fizzled away to nearly nothing.  I see a picture of that jar above.<br /><br />Now, four days later, the jar has gone to a professor, recovered, fully colonized, been spawned into a tray, and the mycelium is already poking up through the casing layer.  Dude, this is not mycologically possible.  Enough.  If this turns into another flame-fest I'm going to close the thread just like the last one.<br /><br />Nobody told you they were gurus or anything else.  What every poster in the thread you started flaming those who would help you said, was that you don't fully colonize a jar in two days from spores.  <br /><br />Your syringe was black.  It did not have mycelium growing in it or it would be white.  However, even a mycelium syringe is not going to colonize a jar in two days, and that same jar if peroxide was dumped into it, would not fizzle down to nothing if it was mushroom mycelium.  Mushroom mycelium would have hardly been affected.<br /><br />I refuse to believe that this jar:<br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi52.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fg27%2Fcasper802%2Fsyr001-1.jpg\"><br />after four days, has recovered, fully colonized, been spawned to a tray, recovered from spawning, and then colonized a casing layer and is now poking up through the top.  This is not possible, as anybody who has ever grown a crop knows.  Mushroom mycelium simply does not grow this fast.  Period.  What you describe is a two and a half, to three week cycle, NOT four days. <br />RR","title":"Re: a message to user 'whatswimdo'","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
