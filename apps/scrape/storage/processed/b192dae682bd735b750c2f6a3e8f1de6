Bulk substrates don't harbor those.  We pasturize to kill mold spores, which are killed by temperatures far below boiling.   The rule when collecting straw or other materials for bulk substrates is to pass over the contaminated ones.  There would be nothing to gain by letting a substrate contaminate just to pasteurize it again, and the mold mycelium would have already consumed some of the food we want for our mushroom mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: An idea concerning increasing contam resistance...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
