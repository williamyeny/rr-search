Back off on misting when primordia are forming, but once they grow into pins, mist away. Always increase air exchange for an hour or two after misting so the moisure can soak in/evaporate off the pins.  Never close them up in a terrarium while wet. The speed of growth is related to moisture content.  More moisture=faster growth.  <br />RR","title":"Re: casing pins"}}
