Not only that, opinions vary considerably.  Next week, I'll be taking my own site down and completely redoing it to reflect the contents of my DVD's that are scheduled for delivery on the 20th of May.  I plan to have section on basic mycology, then a page on each tek in the video, to discuss each of those teks in more detail. The video moves very fast in order to cover as much as possible about growing in the 4 hours I had available on 2 DVD's. I'll also try to answer the 100 most frequently asked questions.  Perhaps after I get that finished, I can start on the FAQ here.   I just wish so many of the teks didn't have names on them.  I don't want to change people's teks, because then egos get involved.  Besides, there's nothing that says I'm right and they're wrong.  The advice I give here is based on my experiences.  Other people have their own experiences.<br />The FAQ is great for getting the basics, but then new growers should read all the posts daily to see what works for people and what doesn't.  I don't reply to every thread, but I do try to read each and every post made in these forums, and if a good answer is given, I move on.  If a very bad answer is given, or no answer is given, I try to help out, unless the subject has been covered to death already, in which case I just ignore it and hope they learn to do a bit of searching on their own.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fix the FAQ!"}}
