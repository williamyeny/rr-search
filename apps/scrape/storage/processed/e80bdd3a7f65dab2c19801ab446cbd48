What we've found from experience is that by adjusting the pH upwards with lime, the mushroom mycelium can 'tolerate' it, but the contaminants have a harder time.  There is usually no need to adjust pH of substrates, but casing layers which don't ever fully colonize can benefit from a higher pH of 7.5 to 8.  This will allow the mushroom mycelium to get the benefits of the casing layer, but will slow the onset of mold contaminants.  However, remember that after a flush or two, the uncolonized parts of your casing layer are going to be susceptible to molds, so be sure to watch daily and toss out any tray at the first signs of 'green' molds.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ph question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
