That's why there's holes in the bottom too.<br />2) Bad choice of location.  It should be exposed to normal room circulation and fresh air.<br />3) Fanning a few times a day is always good.  Fresh air is the best preventative for contamination and also a major pinning trigger.<br />4) Humidity won't drop.  It will stay in the mid to upper 90% range.<br />5) NEVER heat a terrarium.  Run it at normal room temperature.<br />6) 70F to 75F is perfect.  Don't let it exceed 80F or performance drops.  In the summer this is hard to avoid, but ice really isn't necessary unless your room heats to 90F or more.<br />7) Set cakes on aluminum foil or a jar lid, never cardboard.<br />8) Racks are good.  They leave more of your perlite exposed to provide humidity.<br />9) Excess spore solution is bad.  No solution is 100% clean, so the more spore solution you use, the more contaminants you also inject.  Expect a higher than normal rate of contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: CO2 in terrarium"}}
