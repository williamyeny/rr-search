If you gag on every bite, then sit during your come-up time trying not to puke, it's no fun.  There is no increase in the number of cells in a mushroom after the veil tears, therefore no new active compounds are made. The cells that are already there simply fill up with water. That means the actives that are in a fresly opened cap are the same actives that are in a huge, umbrella shaped, black spore covered cap, but you have to eat more to get them.<br /><br />When we say there is little to no loss of potency, that's what we mean.  None was lost, but none was gained either.  Only mass was gained, thus you gag more for the same amount.  That's what I mean by poor food quality.<br /><br />As for developing allergies, mine have all come in the last few years as I've researched many species.  I often have a few hundred jars and up to several hundred spawn bags going at any one time.  This has been my full time job since I've been working on my dvd.  I quit my job over a year ago, so I've been exposed to a lot of mushroom spores in that time.  All of them legal edibles, by the way.  The worst for causing allergic reactions is Hypsizygus ulmarium, but cubensis spores will clog up a humidifier filter in no time, and ruin the motor bushings as well.  Cube spores will also foul hygrometers, and if you have a computer in the room with your grow, it will destroy the cooling fans, and if they get into the hard drive, will destroy it as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Time to harvest?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
