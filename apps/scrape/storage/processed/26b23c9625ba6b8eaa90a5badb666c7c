If one were following my rye prep tek, they would shake after removing the jars from the pressure cooker, and then inoculate and let sit until colonization reaches 20% to 30%.<br /><br />In addition, it doesn't take days for spores to germinate.&nbsp; At normal room temperature, spores begin to germinate on grains within 20 minutes of inoculation.<br />RR","title":"Re: knocked up jars with wet grains and didn't shake beforehand. what do i do?"}}
