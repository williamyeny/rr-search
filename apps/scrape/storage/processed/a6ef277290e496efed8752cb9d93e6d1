(corrected to dissolve any misunderstanding)<br />Lets narrow it down...at what point do the grains become sterile?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />20 minutes at 121C/250F is required for sterilization of grains.&nbsp; That's the temp as measured at the center of the jar of grains.&nbsp; That's why we leave the PC at pressure for an hour or longer, to ensure the interior of the jar remains at 250F for the necessary time.<br /><br />BRF jars can be steam sterilized at atmospheric pressure because rice flour doesn't contain bacterial endospores.&nbsp; However, they do need to be heated to the boiling point to kill live bacteria, so they had better be surrounded by steam if you want any moisture to be left in the jar.<br />RR","title":"Re: Egret's Oven Sterilized TC Grow"}}
