That 100 cfm is at zero static pressure.  To push air through a filter, your fan has to be capable of producing static pressure and will be labled as such.  That means a squirrel cage fan.   The so-called posi pressure gloveboxes you see with computer fans work simply because they don't work.  If the fan were really drawing in 100 cubic feet of air per minute into a glovebox, every jar or petri dish ever done inside would contaminate.  As it is, they're little more than still air gloveboxes with a noise maker attached. Even if a bit of air comes out the arm holes, it's most likely entering either through those same arm holes or through cracks in the seal around the lid.  Air flow will always follow the path of least resistance, which isn't going to be through a filter.<br /><br />Also, trying to filter airborne contaminants with a dust mask is a little bit like trying to catch mosquitoes with a butterfly net.  It ain't gonna work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fan not strong enough to pull air through HEPA Filter.......","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
