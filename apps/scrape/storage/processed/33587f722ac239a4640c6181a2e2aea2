Also, try using three or four 1/16\" holes instead of one large one.  By using smaller holes, the grains won't come into contact with your filter when you shake.  A filter that is wet with grain juice is an invitation for bacterial contamination.  I learned this the hard way from using plastic lids where the filters were inside the jar.  I had a bacterial contamination rate of nearly ten percent.  After switching to the method described above, the problem went away.<br />RR","title":"Re: bacteria in g2g jars"}}
