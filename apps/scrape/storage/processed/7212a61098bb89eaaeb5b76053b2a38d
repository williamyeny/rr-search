Gentamycin sulfate is autoclavable.&nbsp; However, that's the reason we sterilize the cakes. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria, not molds, and molds are the main contaminant we worry about when growing.<br /><br />Antibiotics are used with agar when isolating or cloning wild fruits from outdoors that are rife with bacteria.&nbsp; The antibiotic gives the mushroom mycelium a chance to outrun the bacteria by slowing down the bacteria a little bit.&nbsp; My experience with Gentamycin sulfate is that it doesn't prevent bacteria, but only hinders it somewhat, allowing the mushroom mycelium to get beyond it on a petri dish so we can make a quick transfer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Media Antibiotic"}}
