By putting your project in the refrigerator, you only delayed your fruiting, nothing else.  I typically see pins within six to ten days after applying the casing layer, when kept at room temperature.<br /><br />Digital hygrometers (in my opinion of course) are not worth the plastic they're made from. Get an analog hygrometer at a cigar shop and you can calibrate it.  To calibrate, wrap your hygrometer up in a damp bath towel for half an hour.  Unwrap and simply adjust the screw on the back until the dial reads 98%.  <br />RR","title":"Re: How long after cold shocking should i see pinheads?"}}
