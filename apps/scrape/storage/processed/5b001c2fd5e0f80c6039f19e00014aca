Do you mind explaining how I'm wrong? Why the fuck would anyone use peat as a casing if its more nutritive than coir?&nbsp; And why do two others agree with me and not you? Please help me to understand why you think coir is a better casing when even you said in some of your videos and posts that peat is better. Coir shouldn't even be used as a casing. Its a substrate.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I didn't say coir was a better casing.&nbsp; You made the incorrect statement that coir is too nutritive and will get contamination easier, which is what I said was incorrect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peat/verm is a better suited casing material, but it must be limed to prevent contamination.&nbsp; I believe coir is better suited as a bulk substrate ingredient, but many other experienced growers use it as a casing layer.&nbsp; There's more than one way to skin a cat in this hobby.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing ?"}}
