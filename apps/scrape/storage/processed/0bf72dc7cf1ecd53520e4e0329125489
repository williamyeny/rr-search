You can see from my picture above that three to four inches of damp, but not wet perlite is holding the hygrometer between 95% and 100% humidity.  Just make sure there is no standing water in the perlite, which actually lowers humidity.  In fact, I have a couple dozen holes drilled into the floor of the FC as well, so any excess water from misting can drain out.   The holes in the floor of the rubbermaid also help to let the CO2 seep out.  Water doesn't evaporate well into CO2, so getting rid of it helps the perlite work better, as well as stimulate pinsets.<br />RR","title":"Re: filtering air into the fruiting chamber"}}
