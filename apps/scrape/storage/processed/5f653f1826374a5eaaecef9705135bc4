But as you say BRF are idiot proof .. but how do you get that they are significantly difficult???&nbsp; And the great thing about BRF for the new guy no PC needed.&nbsp; Now this hobby really doesn't cost that much over all even for the new guy!&nbsp; But putting out over a $100 for a PC isn't a easy decision for some. \"but just remember you can still cook some killer dinners in it \"&nbsp; Also you can get a good harvest of BRF cakes if you stack and keep them well hydrated.&nbsp; But to each their own opinion.&nbsp; But to tell the truth PF tek or BRF cakes are tried and true method and don't think you'll ever quit hearing about them anytime soon.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/><br /><br />Here's a tip boys and girls.&nbsp; Listen to the old timers who have done this a time or two.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most young growers started off on brf cakes, and then moved to bulk.&nbsp; For some reason, they then begin to think of brf cakes as a 'beginner' tek, not worth of their advanced skill sets.&nbsp; A few years down the road they say, \"gee, that sure did work good and was easy as hell\".<br /><br />If you're trying to feed an army, grow bulk.&nbsp; If you're trying to feed your own head, you can't beat brf cakes.&nbsp; They're the fastest method to go from spores to finished product, the least amount of effort to go from spores to finished product, and the least expensive method to go from spores to finished product.&nbsp; The old timers still use the tek and don't bash it.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you see folks slamming the brf/pf tek as bunk, look at the registration date on their account.&nbsp; You see noobs saying it's no good, but not the long-term members who have long ago forgotten about ego trips associated with growing.<br />RR","title":"Re: getting started, wanting to grow a large amount, help/tips....","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
