It's a great learning tool, but nobody runs a commercial mushroom farm using 1/2 pint cakes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The brf/pf tek is great for new growers to learn the ropes and it's great for testing isolated strains.&nbsp; For people to slam the easiest and fastest way to get mushrooms is just plain dumb.&nbsp; That's like saying a three year old kid shouldn't ever get a tricycle for his birthday because a Harley Davidson will get him where he wants to go much faster.&nbsp; People need to realize than any hobby is a learning experience.&nbsp; You don't slam your kindergarten teacher for teaching you the ABCs, simply because you can now read 'War and Peace'.<br />RR","title":"Re: Prints courtesy of Losfreddy... passing on the Strain...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
