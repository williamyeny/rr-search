When germinating spores on agar, I never allow the initial growth to get larger than 1/2\" (1cm) before beginning transfers.<br />Cut through the mycelium and the agar and transfer both to the new dish, but remember, only a very small piece.  If you transfer a large wedge, there is a greater chance you'll also transfer some of the contaminant along with it.<br />This is the reason we use agar.  It's for isolation from contaminants, which can't be done in the three dimensional space of an LC or grain/brf jar.<br />Wrap your dishes with parafilm.  Leaving a petri dish unwrapped is like using a grain jar without a filter.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar emergency - myc growth but container has bacteria n the sides"}}
