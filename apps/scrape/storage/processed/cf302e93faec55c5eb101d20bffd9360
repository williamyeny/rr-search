Next, open each freshly sterilized rye jar one at a time, and pour and twist from the grain master to deliver a small amount into each receiving jar.  Try to have the receiving jars open for no more than five seconds, so plan ahead and work fast.<br /><br />Clean all jars with alcohol before opening.  Wear latex gloves and wash them with alcohol after putting them on.  As said above, use a glovebox, or even better of course is a laminar flow hood.
