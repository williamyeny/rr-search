I use it in a mix and it works well.  Those who live in rural areas with access to horses or real cows can get the real thing which is obviously superior.  For those of us in the concrete jungle, the bagged up stuff makes a bit more sense.  At the very least, cut it 50% with vermiculite.  Save your coffee grinds and toss them in.  Coir is good mixed into the substrate, but it's really too expensive to be worthwhile unless you have someplace other than pet stores to get it.","title":"Re: Store bought cow manure?"}}
