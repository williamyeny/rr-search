If you have excess moisture, it will soak it up.  If you have the correct moisture, it will screw it up by making the grains too dry.  The trick is to learn to get the right moisture content.  Grains should be totally dry on the surface before loading jars.  That's all.  It's simple.  The moisture inside the grains is what you want.  Either use a towel to dry after draining, or drain the grains after a simmer, and toss them around in the strainer so the steam can dry the surface.<br />RR","title":"Re: How's the moisture content look?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
