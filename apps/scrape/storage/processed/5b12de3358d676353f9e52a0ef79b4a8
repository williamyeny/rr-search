Dumb Q on that, but do you start timing once the whole surface of the water comes to a boil, or just when you see a fairly steady stream of bubbles coming up in a few columns of (unstirred) water throughout the pot as that occurs for I think like 2-3 minutes b4 the entire surface starts to boil.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Neither really.&nbsp; Everyone has different sized pots they boil the water in, so it will be different times.&nbsp; Place your meat thermometer into the center of one of your substrates.&nbsp; Reduce the stove when the substrate reaches 120F or so, because it will continue to rise for half an hour.&nbsp; Once the substrate reaches 140F, start your timer, and try to keep the substrate from exceeding 160F during that 90 minutes, even if that means lifting the jars out of the water.<br /><br />After a few times using your substrate, your jars or bags, and your kettle of water, you'll have developed a procedure that you can just repeat without all the measuring and timing.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question on Pasteurizing Bulk Substrate"}}
