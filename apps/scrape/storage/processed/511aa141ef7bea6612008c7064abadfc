There's a reason for this.  Agaricus fruits at ten to twenty degrees cooler than cubensis in very low light.  There is far less evaporation of moisture from the casing layer at lower temperatures, thus the reservoir effect of vermiculite is not as necessary.  For a given volume, verm holds more moisture than peat, thus combining the two results in a compromise that favors fruiting in warmer conditions.<br /><br />'Units' refers to volumetric measurements.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hey Experts, what does 50% peat add except a pain in the butt?"}}
