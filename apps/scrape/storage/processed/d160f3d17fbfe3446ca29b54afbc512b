By early September, it's back to 24/7. I have all the dead wood on my property to supply my own firewood for the rest of my life, so it's free heat. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif\" alt=\":laugh:\" title=\":laugh:\"/>&nbsp; I can't imagine heating in this climate with electricity or oil.&nbsp; Gosh, that would break the bank.<br /><br />As said, your temps are too high, and it takes about a week to ten days to see growth.&nbsp; Put your jars on an open bookshelf so air can circulate around them and forget they're there for another week.<br />RR","title":"Re: help please"}}
