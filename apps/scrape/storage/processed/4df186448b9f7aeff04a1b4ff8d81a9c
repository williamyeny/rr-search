Also, pelletized lime, regardless of mg content won't do much good as it's designed to break down over a couple of growing seasons outdoors.  The life of your casing is measured in weeks, not months or years, so you'll need water soluable lime(hydrated)  Oyster shells, egg shells, etc., are excellent soil conditioners, but they won't break down fast enough in a casing to alter the ph.
