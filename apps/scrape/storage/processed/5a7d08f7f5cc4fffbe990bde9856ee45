Put the gypsum and sawdust in a coffee grinder and grind to a powder before mixing with the cold water. Tap water should be fine if it's non-chlorinated in your area, but I prefer distilled water for agar work, especially if you have a well.&nbsp; I've found well water can be quite high in minerals and some of these tend to inhibit growth. Of course, well water is great if you run it through a filter.<br /><br />Also, depending on which MEA recipe you use, you may want to cut back slightly on the malt and yeast to about 75% of the recommended amounts. Use the full amount of agar agar so it won't be soupy. I've found fastest growth on petri dishes when the mycelium is a big 'hungry' so a weaker mix seems to keep the mycelium searching for food.&nbsp; Bear in mind, this is a very slow growing mycelium compared to most other mushroom species, so attention to sterility is mandatory.&nbsp; Personally, I use between 1/20 and 1/15 of a gram of gentamycin sulphate per liter in my agar as an antibiotic when germinating spores, cloning, or using a culture obtained from somebody else that might be of unknown cleanliness.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, this species fruits well on most hardwoods.&nbsp; In the Pacific Northwest, Alder sawdust and chips are excellent, but I've also had good luck fruiting on Douglas Fir chips mixed into Alder sawdust.&nbsp; Douglas Fir sawdust and chips resulted in a poor fruiting. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: light honey + water +agar"}}
