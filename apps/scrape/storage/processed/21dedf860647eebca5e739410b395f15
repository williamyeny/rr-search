The best way is to drill a bunch of holes over time until your moisture content starts to drop then cover up the last holes you made. Of coarse this requires you to have a reliable hydrometer.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I never said such a thing.&nbsp; If you make the terrarium by the tek, it will work properly.&nbsp; Fresh air is important, and if your cakes are drying out as they should, you mist to replace this lost moisture.&nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hydrometers are not used in mycology.&nbsp; You need an analog <i>hygrometer</i> that can be calibrated by the damp towel method for measuring relative humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: Excessive Amount of Holes in Fruiting Chamber Necessary?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
