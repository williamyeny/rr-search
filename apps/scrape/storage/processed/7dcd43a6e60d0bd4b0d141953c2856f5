If it's green, toss it out.  If you want to save the jars themselves, drop them into boiling water for an hour first.  You don't want to release those green spores into your house, or they'll just increase your chances of seeing them again down the road.  Good luck.<br /><br />If you explain to the vendor that the three of one strain are all ok, and all the ones from the other syringe contaminated, I'll bet you get a replacement syringe sent out at no cost.<br />RR","title":"Re: First grow, Green Mold...
