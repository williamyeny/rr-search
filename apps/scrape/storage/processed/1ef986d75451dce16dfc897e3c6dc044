In fact, I don't recommend blood meal anymore, even though I did in the past.  I've found that a lot of bloodmeal is bad, and a small amount really doesn't help at all.  It seems the blood meal really needs to be composted along with the substrate to be of much good.  <br /><br />If you're composting, blood meal will add nitrogen that will help to heat up the pile, but after numerous side by side tests, I found no benefit to adding it to a substrate.  I apologize that some of my previous posts recommended it, so please disregard those.<br /><br />You don't need food grade gypsum.  Just pick some up at a garden center.  In fact, the 'garden gypsum' I get from my local Lowe's and garden centers is made from the broken up scraps from a drywall plant.  Sheetrock and other brands of drywall are composed of calcium sulphate.<br />RR","title":"Re: First time grow, a few questions."}}
