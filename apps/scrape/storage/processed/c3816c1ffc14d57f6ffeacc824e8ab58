That means for a 4 square feet filter, you would want 500 cfm.  More isn't better.  A flow hood is not 100% effecient.  At 99.9%, that extra air blowing through that you don't need brings with it quite a bit of nasties.  .001% of 300,000 particles of contaminant spore per cubic foot of air is a LOT of nasty stuff getting through.  I'd at least block off part of the intake to slow down the air.  You'll still need a picture of the data plate if you want the 'for sure' way to wire it.  Grainger used to have that info on their website, but I can't find it now.<br /><br />For 240 volt operation you wire the windings in series, and for 120 volt operation, you connect them in parallel, so it's important to have the diagram.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wiring a Large Dayton Fan","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
