It's important to note that a 1/2\" hole is 4 times as large as a 1/4\" hole, so if they're too big, you can easily dry out the air within.<br /><br />Make sure holes are on all six sides, as this is important for proper air exchange and humidity.  If you have trouble maintaining humidity, simply run a coolmist humidifier in the room your fruiting chamber is located.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fruiting Chamber Question With Pics!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
