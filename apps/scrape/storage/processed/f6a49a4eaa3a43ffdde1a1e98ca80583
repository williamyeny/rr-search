If it did, I wouldn't get 999 out of 1000 substrates making it through harvest with no mold, because I use coffee in every single one of them. Improper technique causes contamination.&nbsp; For those who consider 'pasteurization' to be dumping boiling water into a bucket, they would be advised to stay away from good substrates, and substrate additives such as coffee, and just be satisfied with mediocre results.<br />Also, while mold spores don't germinate on coir, they certainly do on vermiculite.&nbsp; Even if one leaves out the coffee and the boost it provides, they'll still get mold growing in the vermiculite if they fail to follow proper procedure.<br />There is no substitute for the benefits to mushroom production from coffee.&nbsp; I doubt seriously it's the 'nutes' because there's lots of different nitrogen sources, etc., but they don't pack the punch of coffee.&nbsp; It must be one of the other 200 or so compounds in coffee, or the combination of all of them.<br />RR","title":"Re: thoughts on CCV"}}
