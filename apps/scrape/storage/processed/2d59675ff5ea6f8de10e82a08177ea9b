You should also roll in dry verm after dunking.  The verm acts as a casing layer that you can mist to hydrate the cake during the flushing cycle.  You can also pour water right on the cake to hydrate it.  Misting the walls is useless.  The moisture needs to be on the cake, not on the walls.  Make sure you have drain holes in the bottom so no water will be standing as that renders any perlite below the water level useless.  After dunk and roll, place the cakes so what was at the bottom of the jar becomes the top.  Most jars are concave on the bottom, so this leaves a 'divot' in that part of the cake, which is perfect for holding water.  You can pour it directly on, and it will soak in over time.  Cakes need a lot of moisture to fruit.<br /><br />Try 3 1/2\" to 5\" of well drained perlite instead of 2 1/2\".  That should get you up to 99% humidity.  <br /><br />Don't cut open a cake.  Contaminants will be on the surface. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: What in the sam hill am I doing wrong."}}
