With larger substrates, the brf at top compresses the brf at the bottom, cutting it off for access to the mycelium.&nbsp; In addition, the air, what little there is, tends to get stale at the bottom of larger jars, preventing colonization. <br /><br />Your chances of a quart jar of brf colonizing is pretty small.&nbsp; I didn't say impossible, but very small chance indeed.<br />RR","title":"Re: Quart Jar BRF"}}
