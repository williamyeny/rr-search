No lime.<br /><br />Gyspsum yes, but no lime.  Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, and since we pasteurize horse manure and then allow it to fully colonize, it's resistant to contamination.  Therefore, a pH in the 5.5 to 6.5 range is perfect.  I used to add a touch of lime to bulk substrates, but no longer do and performance is better.<br /><br />We add lime to casing layers to protect them against molds, since they don't fully colonize with mushroom mycelium.","title":"Re: Am I supposed to put lime into my horsepoo bulk substate?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
