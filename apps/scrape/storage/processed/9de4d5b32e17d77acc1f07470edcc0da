They're usually the ones who have 'every single jar contaminate' in their second six months, lose interest and quit the hobby.<br /><br />Live spores will stick to your clothes, body, shoes, etc., and be brought back inside.&nbsp; A few times dumping out contaminated jars and you'll have a very hard time growing successfully due to the ambient mold spore count.<br /><br />Depending on how you do the math, it's best to either toss out contaminated jars, or PC them before opening up to dump.&nbsp; If you're following proper technique, you won't get more than a few per year, so it's not really a big time or cost issue.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you're opening up moldy jars to dispose of the contents anywhere near your work area, or you go near your growing area after dumping the jars, you won't be successful for very long.<br />RR","title":"Re: using the same contaminated jars"}}
