Mist cakes a couple of times per day, especially if they've ben dunked and rolled.  Keep that verm damp.  What you need is a higher priced mister.  It should spray a very fine mist and not puke out large droplets that will damage your mushrooms.  Aim it up so the mist gently falls onto your cakes.  This won't damage the fruits.  Yours will probably recover.<br />RR","title":"Re: Has my friend damaged their cakes by misting\\spraying them?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
