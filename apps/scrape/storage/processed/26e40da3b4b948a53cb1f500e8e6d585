We've known for a long time that 86F figure was bunk.<br /><br />Toss out the contaminated bags and start over.&nbsp; To answer your question, sterilization is never complete, regardless of what you read elsewhere.&nbsp; It would take 24 hours to completely sterilize a bag of rye berries, and they'd be a useless mash of slimy material after that long.&nbsp; The one to two hour sterilization we give is a window of opportunity to get the grains colonized before contamination sets in.&nbsp; The bacterial endospores are not all killed during a two hour cycle.&nbsp; When you 'incubate' you stimulate them to germinate, while slowing down the mycelium.&nbsp; Thus, the bacteria wins.<br />RR","title":"Re: What am I doing wrong?
