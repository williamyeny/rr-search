It can't fruit until that happens, so it's better to allow it to stay in the jar, rather than drying out in a fruiting chamber.  By consolidate, I mean to allow the mycelium time to digest part of the substrate, rather than simply colonizing it.  If you do that, once you birth, dunk and roll it will explode into pins.   Don't wait for invitro pins, as that's counterproductive to getting the most out of your substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: waiting on birthing...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
