What kind of door does it have?  You can probably just leave it partly open.  I have a home made greenhouse with two slits cut from floor to ceiling, plus a few other holes big enough to stick my hands through for ventilation.  A cool mist can easily keep up with the humidity requirements of a well ventilated greenhouse, and the more air exchange, the better.<br /><br />I even have a small air conditioner ducted into my greenhouse for use with cold weather species that require cold shocking.  Right now, I'm maintaining 58F and 90% humidity with two coolmists running three minutes on, three minutes off.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Martha Plastic."}}
