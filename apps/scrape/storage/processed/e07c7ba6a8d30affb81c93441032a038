I don't see any mold at this time. They were probably fighting a bit of bacteria that got a start due to low gas exchange and high temperatures. You do want to keep it fairly well sealed up during colonization.  The reason is to hold in the CO2, because a high CO2 level during colonization keeps the mycelium from 'eating' as much of your substrate.  I'd avoid saran wrap in the future, and use a black tray with foil crimped over the top and two or three nail sized holes poked into it.  This will allow a bit of gas exchange around the edges of the foil, and also keep it dark.  You don't need to keep colonizing jars in the dark, but it's a good idea to keep bulk substrates and casing layers dark during colonization so you can time the major pinning triggers to occur at the same time.<br /><br />If you plan to case that, wait until it's fully colonized and then apply a casing layer.  Otherwise, you can fruit it uncased.  At full colonization, place into a fruiting chamber and increase the air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing problems-PICS-","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
