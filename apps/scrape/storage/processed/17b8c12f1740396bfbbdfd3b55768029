Removing them after use might help, but they really need a few hours to stabilize. I take a water hose to my grow area three times daily, flooding the whole darn thing from ceiling to floor, and the water then goes out the floor drains. Even my $250 digital hygrometer is as inaccurate as the cheap bastards, and it's located in the dry room with a remote sensor.&nbsp; For accurate readings, get a real hair hygrometer.&nbsp; They're spendy but super accurate.&nbsp; I built a drip shield to keep the direct water spray off mine.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hygrometer Question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
