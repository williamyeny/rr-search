If a company is marketing a myco bag to raise co2 you'd think they'd run a little experiment of some sorts to help persuade you. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />If they gave figures, they'd be bogus.&nbsp; The CO2 increase will correspond to the amount and density of the plants, the growth stage they're in, the temperature, and of course how much fresh air is being pumped in to cool the area from the lights.&nbsp; Plants in mid-flowering will suck up a lot of CO2, while in early veg almost none.&nbsp; You'll want a CO2 meter for sure.<br /><br />I'm also an organic grower, depending on mychorrizi and bacteria in the soil.&nbsp; This is why CO2 supplementation isn't needed provided you can maintain ambient outdoor CO2 levels around your plants.&nbsp; For additional CO2 to be of benefit, you'd also have to increase lighting, fertilizer, temperature, etc., while lowering humidity to encourage the plants to transpire more.&nbsp; Then, when you did all that they'd be less potent because they'd have more green plant material but you would have done squat to increase the density of trichome production.<br />RR","title":"Re: How effective are mushrooms at producing co2?
