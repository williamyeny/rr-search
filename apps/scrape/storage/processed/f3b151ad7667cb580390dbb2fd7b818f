If this was so, the sun would decompose the oceans by just shining on them and there would be no CO2 in the atmosphere. So additional energy is coming from somewhere and I suggest that it is coming from the recombination of magnetic monopoles.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />He's saying if sunlight had enough energy to make plants grow it would 'decompose' the oceans, therefore it must be some magical monopole created by photons in solar flares becoming magnetic.&nbsp; Obviously he has no science background.&nbsp; However, this shows he went to one new-age fair too many:<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Let's start with the conductivity of electrons (or, called by another name, electric monopoles). A wire for electron conductivity consist of a electron conductor like a metal which is covered by a non conductor material like a plastic which is an electron insulator. . .Now I propose that there is parity in the universe between electric monopoles and magnetic monopoles. So, according to this theory, a good conductor for magnetic monopoles would consist of just the opposite structure. We would want and insulator like a plastic covered by an electric conductor. How wonderful nature is that it provides just that structure in the plant's root stems, and branches. The core of the plant root stems and branches is a wood-like material like cellulose (a natural plastic material) which is covered by a bark-like material which contains a water like sap which is an electrical conductor. Callahan calls this structure a wave guide for magnetic monopoles, I call it just a good conductor for magnetic monopoles. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />I call it pulling shit out of your ass and stating it as fact.<br /><br />If this idiot has a Ph D it came out of a box of Cracker Jacks. <br />RR","title":"Re: Using magnetic water in cultivation","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
