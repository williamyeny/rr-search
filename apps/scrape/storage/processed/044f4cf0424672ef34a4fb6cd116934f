The mycelium colonizes the <i>available</i> substrate and then fruits.  Sometimes, the limits of available substrate are determined by the cold temperatures in the fall, thus fruiting is initiated with species such as shiitake and P nameko, etc.  I've seen Hericium fruiting in the wild from the same tree for decades.  Obviously, it didn't capture the whole tree the first, or even succeeding years.  <br /><br />Many species of mycelium are secondary decomposers, thus they can't even begin to colonize a part of the tree until some other species has finished munching that area.  Thus, when the mycelium reaches that inaccessible part, full colonization is reached.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this a good idea"}}
