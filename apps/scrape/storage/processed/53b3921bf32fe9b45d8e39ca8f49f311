Then stored them (completely sealed off) until i was ready to mix in my vase. So far i see nothing oddly textured. Thanks for the info, fruiting them should be easy. Ill keep this updated with more pictures as it goes.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's not nearly enough so I doubt it will fully colonize without molding.&nbsp; You want the center of the sawdust to be at 140F to 160F for 60 to 90 minutes.&nbsp; You probably didn't even get it up to that temperature in an oven.<br /><br />Next time if you're pasteurizing place the bag in a large pot of water and heat to a boil.&nbsp; Let boil until your meat thermometer in the center of the bag starts to move off the bottom peg.&nbsp; At that point, reduce the setting on the stove to stop the boil, but keep it hot. <br /><br />Adjust as necessary to keep the center at the correct temperature range.<br /><br />Also next time, get some citric acid or lemon juice to reduce the pH of the sawdust to around 4.&nbsp; The mycelium will glow much brighter.<br /><br />I doubt seriously they'll fruit in that bowl.<br />RR","title":"Re: Panellus stipticus, incubation and fruiting info","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
