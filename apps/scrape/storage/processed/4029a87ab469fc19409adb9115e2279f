The larger size you use, the dryer you make it.  In a quart jar, the ratio is nearly 1 to 1.   In a spawn bag holding 15 quarts, the ratio would be closer to 1.5 to 1.(rye to water)  You'll have to experiment.   Personally, I don't like spawn bags for grains.  I still use jars, and save the bags for sawdust/chips.<br />RR","title":"Re: Straight Rye --> bags","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
