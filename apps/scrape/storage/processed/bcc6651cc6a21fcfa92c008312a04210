I use tap water, not distilled.  If you get a lot of calcium buildup from tap water, then go ahead and use distilled, but it's not necessary.<br /><br />If you're using brown rice flour, 45 minutes for your 500ml jars is plenty at 15psi/100kpa, and your elevation.  If you're cooking grains, I'd use 60 to 90 minutes, depending on if you're using 500ml or 1 liter jars.<br />RR","title":"Re: All American, Sterilizers or Pressure Cookers?"}}
