I had fine verm, so had to dig through the perlite to find a piece small enough to match, or I wouldn't have been able to get them both in focus at the same time.  I'll get a picture of a larger piece later.  They're really spectacular to look at.  The camera just doesn't do them justice compared to the way they look through the binocular lenses of the microscope.<br /><br />I just thought they made it very clear why we use one to evaporate moisture, and the other to store moisture.  It allows you to make a more informed answer when someone asks this question later.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Difference Between Vermiculite & Perlite w/pics","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
