You want bright fluorescent light in the high frequency range.  Look for 'natural daylight' tubes or whatever they call them in your country.  They should have a color temperature of 6,000 Kelvin to 7,000 Kelvin for best results.<br />I use coolmists and have never used an ultrasonic.  They're overkill in my opinion, since a coolmist will move air and humidify a small greenhouse very well.<br />Be glad you don't have wal mart.  They destroy jobs and wages, as well as small business wherever they go.  I've boycotted them for ten years.  I won't step foot in one of their stores.  In fact, we won't even allow them to build one in my city.<br />RR","title":"Re: Will this gear me sufficient enough for a nice grow?"}}
