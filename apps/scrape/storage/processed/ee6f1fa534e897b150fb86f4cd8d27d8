Mushrooms require bright light to develop properly, even though they use it in a different way than plants do.&nbsp; The 6500K you're using is the correct color temperature. Direct sunlight for a few minutes per day is also great for helping a stubborn substrate begin pinning, or to help fruits develop into maximum size and weight.<br /><br />The bluing is generally caused by moisture content of the substrate, NOT lack of oxygen.&nbsp; If it were lack of oxygen, all cakes in jars would be solid blue.&nbsp; Either too much moisture or not enough, or rough handling of the cakes will cause a blue reaction.&nbsp; Pick up your cakes and you can easily tell if they're too dry or too wet by the weight.<br /><br />Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, so get rid of the aquarium and build a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; People today on average get several times more product from brf cakes than people did ten years ago following the pf tek, which robs the cakes of fresh air and leaves them wallowing in CO2.&nbsp; You can also mist the cakes directly without worry, something people were incorrectly advised not to do ten to fifteen years ago.<br />RR<br /><br />","title":"Re: Myc Cake Getting Blueish in FC"}}
