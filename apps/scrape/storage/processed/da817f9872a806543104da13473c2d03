However, I still bring the soaked rye to a full boil anyway.  They don't absorb any more water this way, but it makes them hot when drained into the collander so that the steam dries the outside of the kernels as they drain.  You want to make sure the grains are totally dry on the surface before you load the jars.  That's the key with any grain.  Wet grains are asking for trouble.<br /><br />Boiling also kills most of the live bacteria that are making the berries stink.  It's good to kill that smelly stuff before pouring it down your sink anyway.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye Berry Tek"}}
