The best thing to do when using that tek the first time is to get a meat thermometer and monitor the manure/compost temperature in the center of the jars.  Try to get the temperature to above 140F for at least an hour, but no longer than two hours, and try not to let the temperature exceed 170F.  With a $3 meat thermometer available at any grocery store, you can adjust the above times to suit your individual situation.<br />RR","title":"Re: pasturize Poo Jars"}}
