There's a big difference between a <i>mushroom</i> that was picked and put fresh in a plastic bag to rot, and a <i>cake</i> with mold on it that was buried outside.  Every mushroom in nature grows in the presence of molds and nobody dies from eating wild boletes, oysters, etc.  For the last time, fruits from substrates that also harbor molds DO NOT RENDER THE MUSHROOMS TOXIC!  In fact, they rarely even impact the flush. <a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjm/v38n2/v38n2a10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjm/v38<wbr>n2/v38n2a10.pdf</a><br />RR","title":"Re: flowerbed grow"}}
