A cell line can only divide so many times before degradation sets in, so that's why there's limits.  Mycelium is amazing in its ability to expand.  One quart of rye can inoculate 10 more, which can inoculate ten more each, with each of those one hundred inoculating ten more, giving you 1,000 quarts of colonized rye within a few weeks.  Each of those one thousand can inoculate ten more, so now you have ten thousand quarts, that can then be spawned to bulk.  You'd need a few tractor-trailers to haul all the mushrooms away.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain2Grain","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
