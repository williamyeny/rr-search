If you'll make the holes smaller than the grains you're using, they won't smack your filter during shaking, possibly getting it wet with grain juice that can lead to contaminants.<br /><br />In addition to drying out, leaving the entire filter exposed provides air exchange instead of simply gas exchange, which will lead to invitro pinning as soon as full colonization is reached, greatly reducing the time you have to use it as spawn to bulk.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tyvek Lids for WBS jars","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
