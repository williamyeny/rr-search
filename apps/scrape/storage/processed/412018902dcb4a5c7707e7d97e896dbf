But question is, how long will I be able to fruit from one set of cakes that I have? Can I theoretically keep dunk n rolling them time and time again? Or does the mycelium die and have a limit to its amount of flush depending on strain/species? Of course for my question its for cubes.</blockquote><br />Outdoors in a flower bed I've seen cakes continue to flush until they're about 1/10 the original size.&nbsp; Indoors, green molds always seem to get the cakes first.&nbsp; This is why we try to nail all the fruiting parameters early to get the most amount of product before green molds naturally take over.<br />One big impedance to multiple flushes is allowing spores to drop.&nbsp; When the mushrooms mature all the way to flat caps with spores everywhere, the mycelium gets the message that its life-cycle is complete and it begins to die back.&nbsp; This is when green molds have easy access to your remaining substrate because the mushroom mycelium has given up on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: how will i tell its my final fruiting?"}}
