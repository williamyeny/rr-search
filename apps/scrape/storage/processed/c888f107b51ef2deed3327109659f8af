Salt has long been used to kill trichoderma.  I use it regularly on straw logs and woodchips/sawdust substrates where the trich only forms on the surface.   I don't hold out a lot of hope if it's in a casing layer or bulk substrate before first flush.  That usually indicates the spawn was contaminated, so the mold is probably spread throughout the whole substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: A journey with Trich","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
