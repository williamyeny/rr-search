Your question is like asking how much weight you can haul in a red truck as compared to a blue or yellow truck, and then demanding people read the question before bringing up that there's different sized trucks, springs, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />You're not to the point of growing large amounts yet, because you haven't learned the basics.&nbsp; Study, learn, study some more, and then ask questions when you can do better than asking how much does each method yield, as if ANYONE can ever answer such nonsense.<br /><br />I'm locking this before it becomes a flame fest.<br />RR","title":"Re: Growing methods and how much they yield...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
