It would take a microscope to identify for certain, but unless you have a good lab to make a microscope slide, it would be a major mistake to even think about opening that jar and releasing tens of billions of contaminants spores into your house/grow area.<br /><br />It is a physical impossibility for grains to reach a temperature above 100C/212F in an oven without completely drying out, and it takes higher temps than that to sterilize.<br /><br />If you really feel the need to save the glass jars for future use, PC them before opening.  Otherwise, toss them in the trash just like they are.<br />RR","title":"Re: Yellow contam"}}
