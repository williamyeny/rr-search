If not, it's just dormant.  Often, pins for the first two or three flushes are set at time of first flush, where they remain dormant until their time comes.<br /><br />If you have a very good pinning strain, and a small or weak substrate, aborts are the mycelium's natural survival instinct.  Since the substrate can't support a massive flush, the excess pins naturally abort to protect the rest.<br /><br />Misting is fine, but be sure to increase air exchange afterward until all the misted water either evaporates or is absorbed into the fruits by osmosis.  If you leave pins wet in a still-air environment, many will abort.<br />RR","title":"Re: cambodian aborts on first flush?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
