If so, 12 volts at 500ma means you need a six watt resistor, but if you're using 11 K ohms, it sounds like you're trying to control an AC fan by reducing current, which doesn't work.<br /><br />If it's a DC fan, try getting a power supply of lower voltage.  A rheostat of the correct watt rating would be large and expensive.  If it's an AC fan, get a motor speed controller. <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/<wbr>accessory/controls2.shtml</a><br />RR","title":"Re: speed controller for lc magnetic stirrer","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
