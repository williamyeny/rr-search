They begin to form stones within a couple weeks of germination.  You can then transfer the stones to new dishes, allow those to grow out, and inoculate grains.  This ensures you have a good sclerotia producing strain.  Once you do the above, simply do two or three g2g to get up to a truckload of mycelium within 30 days if you want it, and it's much faster than messing with silly lc's.<br />RR","title":"Re: Any trick to getting mexicana, tampensis, azurenscens and atlantis LC's to work?"}}
