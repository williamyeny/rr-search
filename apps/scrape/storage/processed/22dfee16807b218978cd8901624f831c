Great advice, thats actually the one I've followed. But he doesn't go into detail on how to dry the straw? <br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's because you're not supposed to dry the straw.&nbsp; <br /><br />You drain it and then as soon as it cools, you use it dripping wet.&nbsp; Leave holes in straw logs or the bottom of laundry baskets or other containers so the excess can drain out over the next two to three days.<br /><br />You also don't need to rinse the soap out.&nbsp; If you soak for 24 hours, you can skip the soap.&nbsp; If you're in a hurry and doing the two hour soak, use soap.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing then drying straw?"}}
