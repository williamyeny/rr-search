I have been looking at the pins and using the way they look as an indication to determine if I need to mist. Like if they are glossy, I don't mist, but if the glossiness is gone when I look, I mist again.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's not the indicator you look for.<br /><br />Remember, you don't mist to give humidity.&nbsp; That's the job your perlite does.&nbsp; You mist to replace the moisture that has evaporated from the substrate because of the fresh air being supplied.&nbsp; Misting up in the air does little good.&nbsp; You should be misting the cake directly so the substrate will absorb the moisture.<br /><br />If your mushrooms are growing very slowly, it could be due to cakes being too dry, or too wet.&nbsp; Both will present as slow growth.&nbsp; The way to tell moisture content is to pick the cakes up and judge by the weight.&nbsp; If they're dry and light, set them in a saucer of water overnight, even with pins.&nbsp; If they're heavy and wet, leave the lid off the fruiting chamber for a day or so to let them dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: What do I need to do to make my pins grow right?"}}
