Those of you who suffered painful ear infections as kids can usually thank one or both of your parents for smoking in the house.&nbsp; <br /><br />Smoke particles act like a 'flying carpet' carrying contaminants piggy-back into your fruiting chamber.&nbsp; Generally, mold spores are constantly landing on your substrates anyway and to keep them from germinating and growing we use massive fresh air exchange which stimulates mushroom mycelium and discourages molds.&nbsp; However, to be safe you should keep smoke and dust around your terrarium to a minimum.<br />RR","title":"Re: smoking marijuana near sgfc safe????","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
