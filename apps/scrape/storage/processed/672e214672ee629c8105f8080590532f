Each previous time, you have flamed others and provoked them to flame you back, disrupting the forum, and causing the threads to have to be closed.  <br /><br />The reason for taking contaminated substrates outside has been explained to you dozens of times, but you're just too daft to get it.  Nobody has ever said they won't recover or fruit inside.  I warned you not to start another flame thread over this or I'd ban your butt and be done with you for the good of the community.  Bye bye.<br />RR","title":"Re: Contamed Casing Fruits indoors! Am I gonna die now?"}}
