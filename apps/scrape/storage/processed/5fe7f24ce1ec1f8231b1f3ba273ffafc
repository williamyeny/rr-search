Alcohol is also great for cleaning your latex gloves after you get them on.  For syringes, heat the needle red hot.  Give it about three seconds to cool, but not cool enough that a contaminant spore could land on it and survive.  Use while still hot.  It only takes about the first three drops of solution to cool the needle, allowing the other 1/2 CC or whatever to flow undamaged.<br /><br />Never use a knife or any other sharp object on spores. They are extremely fragile. Inoculating loops are made of wire, so only a rounded surface touches the spores.  You also heat the inoculating loop red hot, but because it's made from very thin wire, it cools in seconds.  <br /><br />Remember, alcohol is not a sterilizer, flaming is.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flaming.."}}
