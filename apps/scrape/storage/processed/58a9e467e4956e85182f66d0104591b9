It takes temperatures in excess of 100C to sterilize grains, and by definition, you can not achieve a temperature higher than 100C if water is present, without pressure.  The only way a microwave or conventional oven could get rye hotter than 100C would be to evaporate all of the water out first. If you want to play, you'll need a pressure cooker or autoclave.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilization","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
