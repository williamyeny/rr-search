Calcium and sulfur are important minerals for healthy mycelium.&nbsp; The stick-preventing qualities are a side-benefit, not the primary function.<br /><br />Liquid coffee will not increase the risk of contamination with grains-failure to follow sterile technique will increase the risk of contamination.<br /><br />Adding coffee grinds to grains is counterproductive, because they're a bulk substrate ingredient.&nbsp; I'm aghast that 8 years after the coffee thread, these most basic questions are still not understood.<br /><br />In addition, if one is <i>sterilizing</i> the bulk substrate, such as in sawdust preparation, a small amount of liquid coffee can be added.&nbsp; I dump my leftover pot of coffee into the sawdust mixer every single day.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain TEK Inquiry","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
