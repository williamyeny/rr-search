NEVER attempt to cut out mold.&nbsp; This has been well-known and documented for many years.<br /><br />I can't take it any more.&nbsp; This thread is a living fail boat full of horribly bad advice.&nbsp; I have to lock it before any more disinformation gets posted here, which will get quoted over and over again years from now. It's bad enough that the OPs grow has been ruined by bad advice. Threads like this one will result in hundreds of more grows being ruined if it isn't nuked. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\":facepalm:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: PE6 Mono *updated with pin pics!!!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
