You need air exchange with terrariums, not gas exchange.  Since you're growing cubensis, the cold shock set your fruiting performance back substantially.  Tropical species do not benefit from cold shocking, it hurts them.  One inch of standing water in your perlite means that part of the perlite is useless and may as well not even be there.  There should be ZERO standing water.  In addition, standing water is a breeding ground for bacteria and molds.   Also, having the terrarium on top of the incubator is likely to lead to condensation, which robs moisture from the air.<br /><br />Terrariums benefit from perlite humidification, but the cool mist running is likely to either dry out the casing layer, or flood it, depending on the type you're using, but either way, it's not a good idea to run a cool mist into a terrarium.<br /><br />Vermiculite is the worst possible choice of a casing material by itself.  You'd get better performance uncased.<br /><br />Cheap digital hygrometers are useless, so you really don't know what your humidity is.  I'd honestly suggest starting over.<br /><br />Set up a terrarium with three to five inches of rinsed but well drained perlite, no humidifier, holes as you have them, spawn grains or cakes to manure and let that colonize fully before either exposing to fruiting conditions, or fruiting uncased. Get rid of the incubator since that is likely where your molds originated due to incubating at a temperature above normal room temperature, which stimulates molds more than mushroom mycelium.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: I'm new to casings and need a little help. W/poll","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
