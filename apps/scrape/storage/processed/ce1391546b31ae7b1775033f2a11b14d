Don't confuse full colonization with overlay. It also takes more than 24 hours for pins to form.  You NEVER lower humidity to get pin formation.  Hyphal knots and primordia form in near saturation humidity, or 99% to 100%.  Once pins form, you can lower humidity a bit if you want, but not before.  <br /><br />The pinning triggers are:  Full colonization, 100% humidity, increased air exchange, and light.  If all that happened within 24 hours of what you did, the primordia were already formed, so it was going to happen anyway.  The rooster may crow at sunrise, but he isn't responsible for the sun coming up.<br />RR","title":"Re: overlay = no delay"}}
