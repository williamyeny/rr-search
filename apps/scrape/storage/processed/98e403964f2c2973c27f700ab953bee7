Mycelium doesn't have a vascular system.  It's composed of long cells, stacked end to end to form a network.  It doesn't take a circulatory system for heavy metals to be absorbed.  Other substances are <i>metabolized</i> by the mycelium.  That's why mushrooms can grow on manure, but we don't get e coli from eating mushrooms.  However, according to stamets, if there's lead or mercury in the soil, they will absorb it.  I've never personally tested for such.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mushroom Mycelial/Fruit Bodies","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
