Condensation shows there is a temperature differential between the inside and outside of the terrarium, and nothing else.  It doesn't in any way indicate humidity.  One needs a hygrometer to tell humidity.  There is no way around that.<br /><br />Asking how to judge humidity without a hygrometer is like asking how to know when you're going the speed limit if your car doesn't have a speedometer.  Nobody can answer that.<br />RR","title":"Re: humidity question"}}
