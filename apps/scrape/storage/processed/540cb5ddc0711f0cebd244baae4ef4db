There is nothing wrong with eating a mushroom from a cake or substrate with mold.  Every mushroom in nature exists in harmony with molds, and wild mushrooms are highly sought after.<br /><br />We don't eat rotten mushrooms because bacteria causes food poisoning.  However, molds are not 'sucked up' by the mycelium and into the fruitbodies.<br /><br />We toss out projects with molds because we don't want to be cultivating and spreading molds in our grow areas, but any healthy mushrooms you pick first are ok to eat.<br />RR","title":"Re: PICTURES. what happened to my shrooms?"}}
