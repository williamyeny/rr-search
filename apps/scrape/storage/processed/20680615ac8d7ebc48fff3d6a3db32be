Depends on how long after sterilization you wait to inoculate. If there is nothing covering the holes then leave the foil on until inoculation. Then ditch it. Otherwise you risk contamination by pushing the needle through a possibly contaminated verm layer.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Incorrect.<br /><br />Remove the foil immediately so the condensation/water under it can evaporate. If not, the verm layer gets saturated and becomes useless.&nbsp; Wet verm is fungi and other contaminant food and they'll colonize right through it. We use breathable micropore tape to prevent the verm layer from accumulating contaminants.&nbsp; Simply wipe the tape with alcohol and inject the red hot needle right through it.<br />RR","title":"Re: My First Grow Attempt - B+ PF Tek"}}
