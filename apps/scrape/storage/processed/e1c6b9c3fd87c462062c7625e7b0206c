Take it back to topia or wherever you got ran off from before you landed here.<br /><br />Chemical fertilizers are not food for fungi as you claim them to be.<br /><br />Minerals are food for fungi which you claim them not to be.<br /><br />I suggest you get off the couch and study a bit of mycology.&nbsp; Absent that, try growing something but the easiest mushroom in the world to grow so you have a knowledge base to lean on. You don't see too many expert bikers teaching tricks to new riders while they still have training wheels bolted to their back axle. <br /><br />If all you know how to grow is cubes, try growing them on BRF cakes, keeping them healthy for a few flushes.&nbsp; They'll shrink to much less than the original quantity of the vermiculite alone, as can easily be determined with a scale.<br /><br />Weigh the dry ingredients before making the cakes and then dry and weigh them after several flushes.&nbsp; The weight of the dry mycelium, what's left of the rice flour, and the verm will be less than the original weight of just the vermiculite.&nbsp; This could only happen if the verm was being consumed.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hydroponic Nutrient Experiment Straw & LC","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
