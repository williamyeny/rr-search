First, the condensation is caused by a temperature difference between inside and outside your terrarium, not excessive humidity. It's the same principle that makes your windows get condensation in the winter, even though it's warm and dry inside the house. You shouldn't heat the terrarium.  If it's too cold in your house, get a space heater in the room the terrarium is in.<br /><br />Second, perlite will not work if it's soaking in water.  You should rinse the perlite under a faucet of running water, then let it drain well, and dump into the terrarium.  NO standing water.<br /><br />It sounds like your cakes dried out due to low humidity and that's the reason for the bluing.<br /><br />You should use a drip shield in your terrarium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Perlite and Condensation"}}
