I've read that in lots of places, but it's flat out wrong.  I've made many, many side by side runs and there is ZERO increase in growth above 80F, with growth falling off rapidly beginning above 83F.<br /><br />As for light, that shelf pictured above is exposed to normal room lighting, which happens to be from six very bright spotlight bulbs for nearly 18 hours per day.  There is no reason to keep colonizing mycelium in darkness.  That's just another of the myths floating around.   Early mushroom growers followed on the agaricus farmers knowledge and grew their mycelium in the dark and had good results.  Therefore, the wrote that mycelium should be 'incubated in total darkness' and that myth is being repeated thirty years later, even though it is just plain wrong.  <br /><br />Light has no effect on colonizing mycelium, either good or bad.<br />RR","title":"Re: I need help with an incubator ASAP, please.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
