It's because cells have an outer wall that protects them.  They don't admit toxins such as alcohol, so that's why something like everclear or 99% or 91% isopropyl alcohol is a poor sanitizer.  <br /><br />Cells admit water through the cell wall by osmosis.  Therefore, if you mix water with the alcohol, the cell wall is tricked into allowing the water to enter, then is destroyed when the alcohol evaporates back out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilization","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
