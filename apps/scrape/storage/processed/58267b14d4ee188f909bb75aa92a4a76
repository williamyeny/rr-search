First, NOBODY uses a sealed up terrarium.  Even if they did, the heat produced by the substrate and the lighting, etc., causes turbulence which stirs the air constantly.<br /><br />I've inserted CO2 probes into terrariums that were constructed properly and there's not even one tenth of one percent more CO2 at the bottom than at the top.<br /><br />Bottom line: Drill holes in all six sides of your terrarium for proper air exchange and you'll not worry about CO2, but it doesn't 'drain' out the holes in the bottom.  If it did, we'd all die from the natural CO2 in the atmosphere settling to the surface, instead of staying mixed with the air.<br />RR","title":"Re: CO2 Idea?"}}
