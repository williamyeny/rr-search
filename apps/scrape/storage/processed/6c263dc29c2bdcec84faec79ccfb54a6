Air exchange is more important with fruiting chambers.  I'm in a very old building that actually should be condemned due to molds in the structure.  My FC's are stacked up against a wall that has black mold coming through.  The FC's are 18\" from this growth of black mold.  None of it has ever infected the substrates, and I've been using that location for a couple of years now.  FAE is the key, not filtered air.<br />There's no link to this method, just what I've described here.  Just trying to help.  Good luck all.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about RogerRabbit's Auto FAE Tub..."}}
