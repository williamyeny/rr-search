Sorry.&nbsp; If you're using a 12\" X 24\" hepa filter, you need a blower that will deliver an AIR SPEED leaving the filter of roughly 100 linear feet per minute.&nbsp; Since a 12 X 24 has two square feet, you would want a motor that could deliver 200 cubic feet per minute at rated static pressure IN a perfect world.&nbsp; Since we don't live in a perfect world, and there's friction losses between the blower and the filter, add about 20% or so to the blower output requirements to make up for these losses.<br /><br />By the above, if you were using a 24\" X 24\" filter, you would have 4 square feet of surface, so you would want a 400 cubic feet per minute blower at the rated static pressure IN a perfect world.&nbsp; Adding 20% to that figure, you'd want a blower that could give you about 480 to 500 cfm.&nbsp; If your blower is too strong, you can always block off part of the intake to cut down on flow.&nbsp; This is commonly used in commercial and industrial facilities and won't harm the blower.<br /><br />The important thing is to make sure the blower you order is rated at the required static pressure.&nbsp; Many cheap blowers might be rated at 'such and such' a flow rate, but at pressure it drops to near zero because they simply cavitate.<br />RR","title":"Re: HEPA filter question"}}
