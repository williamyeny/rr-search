(did I mention I'm anal about that shit?)<br />I can stuff the boiler with logs and go 8 hours, but it causes a lot of smoke and creosote buildup in the chimney.&nbsp; I've already had one chimney fire, and it scared the hell out of me.&nbsp; The whole stack was glowing red-hot and flaming creosote was shooting out the top.&nbsp; If we hadn't already had snow cover on the ground, I'd have started a forest fire.&nbsp; Can't let that happen again.<br />I do need to lighten up and let the Mrs fill in now and then, but I'd lay awake worried she'd screw it up. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />I'm working on taking it <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/15325625#15325625\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">big-time</a> with a new mega-facility, at which time I'll retire this operation.&nbsp; Until then, I doubt I'll get much sleep.<br />RR","title":"Re: If I've ripped your head off lately. . ."}}
