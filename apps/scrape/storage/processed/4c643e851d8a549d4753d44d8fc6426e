I have 7 filter disks and tons of polyfil as well.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Plastic lids suck.&nbsp; Get metal lids, drill four 1/16\" to 1/8\" holes in each lid.&nbsp; Place the lid down, then the filter disk, and then screw the ring on top.&nbsp; This keeps your filter disk dry.&nbsp; If you insist on using a syringe, lift the lid and filter up and squirt the spores directly in, obviously in a glovebox or preferably in front of a laminar flow hood.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>fngbronco said:</b>I do have N95 masks and a box of nitriles. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />If they're N95 dust masks, they're useless.&nbsp; They're designed to protect the wearer from contaminants entering his respiratory system.&nbsp; They do nothing to filter the bad breath of the wearer.&nbsp; Surgical masks on the other hand are designed to stop 99% of the exhaled bacteria from the doctor, thus protecting the patient.&nbsp; This is what we should be using.<br />RR","title":"Re: Losing the battle with bacrteria"}}
