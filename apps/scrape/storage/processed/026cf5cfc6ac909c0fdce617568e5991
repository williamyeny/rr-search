I used to always just wash spider mites off with the garden hose. They don't like getting wet, so a daily spraying up near the top of the plant where they hang out pisses them off and they leave.&nbsp; You can also add a touch of dish soap to the water and that suffocates them.<br /><br />Also, what fungus would grow on your plants?&nbsp; I can think of powdery mildew(similar to cobweb), and peroxide will take care of it if the metabolites don't.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: Metabolites as a fungicide?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
