For the home grower, you can grow out grains and do grain to grain transfers to expand the mycelium far more rapidly than you can with honey, karo, OR fruit juice.<br /><br />In addition, many growers waste valuable time by injecting spores into sugar water.  Many times, you don't know you have contaminants present until you use your 'lc' to inoculate grains or brf.  By then, you would have long ago discovered the contamination and replaced the contaminated jars, had you been growing on grains or brf directly.<br /><br />That said, I'd still suggest a means of gas exchange.  In a glovebox, drill a 1/4\" hole in the lid using a flame sterilized drill bit. Sanitize the lid with alcohol before drilling. You can simply use rubberbands to hold a piece of tyvek over and around the neck of the bottle.  Inject through that and then cover the hole with micropore tape.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bottle of apple juice growing mycelium","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
