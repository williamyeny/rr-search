The wood stove is stoked up to bring indoor temps to 75F to 78F, and the humidity in our cabin is just under 30%, even with a cool mist running near the wood stove.&nbsp; The hygrometer in my shotgun terrarium is reading 93%.<br /><br />If necessary, simply run a small coolmist humidifier near the terrarium, or you could probably lay a damp towel over it to help as well.&nbsp; A few mistings per day will also work wonders for your RH.<br />RR","title":"Re: A little rH problem...."}}
