However, everyone from me to the reputable vendors to paul stamets has found that fewer spores are much better.  Think about it:  The more spores scraped off a print, the more natural contaminants are also scraped off.  Since mold grows far faster than mushroom mycelium, it's self-defeating.<br /><br />I'd suggest setting those jars aside, and ordering from a reputable vendor before you start any more projects.<br />RR","title":"Re: I Don't believe it's mold is it??"}}
