Don't increase above the mid 70's for fruiting.  If the weather is hot and you can't get it that low, don't worry, but never deliberately heat a fruiting chamber above the mid 70's.<br /><br />Personally, I'd get rid of the peroxide in your mister.  While the mycelium can tolerate peroxide, it doesn't make it very happy.  Also, a dunk at the two week period didn't help matters.  Continue fanning, mist only when and if necessary, and wait.  Perlite in a mono tub is likely to be giving you near 100% humidity which is too high for cased substrates.  I'd dump the perlite out next time you fan and let the tray of substrate supply the humidity.<br /><br />It shouldn't have taken that long to colonize, so something else is off.  Either your moisture content, ph, substrate packed too tightly, a substrate not to they're liking, or cold temperatures, to name a few.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: slow mushroom growth"}}
