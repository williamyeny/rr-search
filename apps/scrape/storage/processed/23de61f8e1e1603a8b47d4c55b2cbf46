Refill the jars with fresh substrate and start over, being more careful the next time.<br />Even if the mycelium 'overruns' the trich, the contaminant is still there.  You can prove this by putting two strains or even two species such as pans and cubes into the same jar.  One does not overrun and take over the other.  Most times both will fruit.  I've had lots of bulk substrates fruit both cubes and pans, so don't think the trich is gone just because you no longer see it.<br />So, the trich is sitting in there ready to come back at any moment.  You don't want that happening in your fruiting chamber where it will release millions of additional trich spores to contaminate your future projects.<br />RR","title":"Re: no answers in contam forum"}}
