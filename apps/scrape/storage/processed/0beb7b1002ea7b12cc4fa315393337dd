Somewhere around here is a 50+ page thread on using coffee from 2003 or '04.<br /><br />The only thing really NOT to do with coffee is dunk with it.  That will stimulate and feed mold spores that land on the cake after birthing.<br /><br />There is no doubt that weak coffee speeds up colonization, and also no doubt that if you use too much coffee it will slow down or stop colonization.<br /><br />Coffee grinds are better suited for bulk substrates, but liquid coffee is great for hydrating grains or pf cakes.<br />RR","title":"Re: pf with coffee"}}
