And then they'd write a 'tek'. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif\" alt=\":frown:\" title=\":frown:\"/><br /><br />20 years later, we know that fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger specifically BECAUSE it causes a drying in the terrarium, thus a loss of moisture from the substrate.&nbsp; This moisture is replaced at intervals during the day, and this results in much greater performance than we got in the 'old days'.<br /><br />You need a larger terrarium.&nbsp; Get rid of that little thing that will cause the air to become stale too fast, and look for one that is at least 16\" tall. Use 4 to 5 inches of well drained perlite and lots of holes per the shotgun terrarium tek on my website.&nbsp; Mist as required, but at least three to five times per day, including just before you leave for work and just after you return.&nbsp; Fan after misting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidity.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
