I make it a point to NOT allow a petri dish to fully colonize.  Remember, we use agar to isolate away from contamanants, and if spores are germinated, to isolate strains away from each other.  We don't use agar to expand the mycelium.  Cut a tiny piece or two of healthy mycelium from each dish and transfer to new dishes.  Eventually, if you transfer fast enough you will help the mushroom mycelium to outrun any contaminants. <br /><br />Reishi is very good at resisting and overtaking molds, and most oyster species are very good at overtaking bacteria, but fast transfers away from the contaminants are the key to success.<br />RR","title":"Re: reishi and oyster agar concerns","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
