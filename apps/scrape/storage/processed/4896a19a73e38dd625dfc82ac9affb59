If they sit in a terrarium wet and in still air, they'll abort.  I wouldn't recommend misting and then touching them with anything.   A syringe works very well for squirting a bit of water in between the pins to wet the casing layer.  You can also lay a sheet of wax paper over the primordia to hold moisture in during the time you should avoid misting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question Regarding Misting During Pinset","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
