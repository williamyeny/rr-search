You should wait one full week after full colonization before birthing.  This allows the mycelium to consolidate its hold on the mycelium.  They will rarely pin during that first week anyway, so keeping them in the jars keeps them in the high CO2 environment, where they also lose less moisture to evaporation.<br /><br />Yours should be fruiting soon hopefully.","title":"Re: Sad my cakes wont pin and i have optimal conditions. :frown:","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
