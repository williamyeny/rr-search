No jar filter is 100% effective, and a jar that is full of mold spores WILL leak some to surrounding jars.  I've seen this many, many times.  One jar will get contaminated but not noticed right away, and all the jars surrounding it will also become contaminated.  There's a big difference between a filter being able to handle the ambient spore load, vs the trillions of mold spores released by a contaminated jar in the immediate vicinity of other uncolonized grain jars.<br /><br />Contaminated jars should be tossed at first sign of green.  Mushroom mycelium does not bruise blue until after full colonization, so it isn't bruising.<br />RR","title":"Re: contam fight","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
