You can go to home depot or similar and just buy a sheet of drywall to use for the gypsum.  Remember, gypsum contains both calcium, a sweetner, and sulphur, which is sour.  Together, they work to hold a steady ph and avoid radical swings.<br /><br />Gypsum is not a substitute for lime.  You still need hydrated(water soluable) lime to get the ph right in the first place.  I shoot for a ph of 8 to 8.5 to start, knowing that as the mycelium colonizes the substrate, the metabolytes which are acidic will lower the ph to around 7 at the time of fruiting, which is perfect.<br /><br />In the US, Best Hardware stores carry hydrated garden lime.  If your local store doesn't have it, you can order it online from <a href=\"http://www.doitbest.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.doitbest.com</a>   Just go to that site and use the site search to type in hydrated lime.  They also have gypsum.<br />RR","title":"Re: pH and stuff","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
