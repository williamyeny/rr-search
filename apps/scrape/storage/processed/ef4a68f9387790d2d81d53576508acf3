I've even poured a bit out of the mister by taking the nozzle off and pouring a small amount between the pins.  You shouldn't have to resort to that unless you get behind the curve on moisture content, which is easy to do in hot weather.  Last time I looked, my FC was over 94F.  I'll probably have to pour some water on later as described above.  It's a major heat wave here and most of us have no air conditioning due to the mild nature of the 'normal' climate.<br />RR","title":"Re: misting casing with pins"}}
