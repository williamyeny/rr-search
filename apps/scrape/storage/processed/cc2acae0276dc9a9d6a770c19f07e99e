However, you can spawn your cakes, spent substrates, contaminated substrates, and even grain spawn into your garden and it will grow.&nbsp; <i>P cubensis</i> is an excellent manure decomposer, so it will help to break down the manure and compost in your garden and make it available to the plants.&nbsp; Cubes will also trap and kill root knot nematodes if you have problems with those.&nbsp; Be careful using grain spawn in your garden if you have problems with squirrels or rabbits in your area because they'll dig up the grains to eat.<br /><br />Mulch the areas with a few inches of straw and the mushrooms will fruit up through it when they're ready.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spores in the Garden"}}
