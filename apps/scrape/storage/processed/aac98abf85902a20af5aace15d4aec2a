Close the bag for the first three days, but then open it a couple times per day to air it out.  That will bring a flush faster than waiting for invitro.  Still, that's pushing it.  I'd start giving it plenty of light from the day you apply the casing.  That goes against proper pinning procedure for a massive pinset, but it might get you a less than fantastic pinset a bit sooner.  You might have some fruits ready around the time you leave, which could come in handy for your new housewarming.<br />RR","title":"Re: Poor situation","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
