You know one you can set for 2 hours off, 1 minute one and it just repeats it.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the cyclestat 4 timer.  There's also some other neat stuff we use on that page.  The pre-wired humidistat is also a winner, but bear in mind, when it gets clogged up with spores it will die a horrible death and need to be replaced.  If you use the humidistat, be sure to pick your flushes on time. <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml</a><br />RR","title":"Re: Martha Humidity Is Too High!?
