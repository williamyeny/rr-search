This helps to establish the circadian rhythm of day/night which will help later.&nbsp; In addition, low levels of ambient lighting speed up colonization.&nbsp; Keep colonizing mycelium out of direct sunlight, but not in darkness, which is outdated information, long since proved false.<br />RR","title":"Re: Golden teacher..
