A colonizing substrate needs gas exchange, but not air exchange, so only have a couple of pin sized holes, or let the gasses escape around the edges where the foil is crimped onto the tray.<br /><br />If you have your substrate at field capacity moisture level, that's plenty for colonization.  A substrate that is wet will not colonize well, if at all.  Just keep it covered and let it colonize. Don't mist. A substrate a bit on the dry side will colonize faster and be more resistant to contaminant molds.<br />RR","title":"Re: mist a casing..."}}
