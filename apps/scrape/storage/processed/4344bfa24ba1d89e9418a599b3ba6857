Try laying a sheet of wax paper over the top of the tray.  Copes like 100% humidity to pin.  I like to wrinkle up the wax paper first, and then flatten it back out before using.  This makes a lot of little passageways for air to circulate under the wax paper, while still keeping your very high humidity.<br /><br />Pan Cyans fruit on their own schedule, and are generally a bit slower to pin than cubes, so just be patient.  It sounds like you're doing it right, except i would have kept them covered with foil for a week or so before fruiting to let the casing layer colonize a bit more.  Don't try to fix it now though, just leave it in the fC.<br />RR","title":"Re: Panaeolus casing, day 10 in fruiting chamber no dense colonization and no pinning"}}
