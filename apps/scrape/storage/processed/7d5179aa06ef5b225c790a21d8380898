There are other molds though that will plague your grows if you don't follow strict sterile procedure.<br /><br />Molds are killed off by low temperatures(below boiling), so you can usually assume they are introduced at the time of inoculation.  That means your entire inoculation procedure needs to be carefully evaluated. Use of a glovebox, gloves, flame sterilized needles, wiping of jars with alcohol prior to inoculation, etc., should be considered mandatory for best success rates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need Help From A Cobweb Mold Invasion!"}}
