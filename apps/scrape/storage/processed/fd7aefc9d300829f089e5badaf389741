The top one might be able to be saved by cutting the bag away and washing that uncolonized area with the goop off.  Once you wash it well, if what's left smells like fresh mushrooms, it's ok.  If it smells sweet, sour, like vinegar or dirty laundry, toss it out.<br /><br />The second bag sure looks like bacteria in the uncolonized parts.  It's that greasy, slime looking stuff.  Another give away is the distinct edge between the uncolonized and colonized parts of the bag.  Healthy mycelium will 'fade' into the uncolonized parts when growing strongly, not form an abrupt edge.<br />RR","title":"Re: Stalled or Done colonizing?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
