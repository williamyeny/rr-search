They're acids and often ethylene based to kill bacteria and are produced in response to it. There may be bacteria in the grains, but not in the metabolites. That's why grain jars should be used at full colonization, not weeks later.  The metabolites are the myceliums defense mechanism.  I've used the metabolites from Hypsizygus ulmarium to kill bacteria and trichoderma on a petri dish.<br /><br />You can probably get away with using those jars to inoculate manure, but I wouldn't use them in a grain to grain transfer.  The bacteria that has started growing would get a foothold in the fresh grains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Myc piss.","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
