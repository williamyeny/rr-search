All work must be done in a glovebox or in front of a laminar flow hood.  There is no part of sterile procedure that can be skipped.  I rarely ever inoculate grains without looking at the culture under the microscope first to ensure it's free of bacteria and/or molds.  On agar, it's easy to see both, so there's really no excuse for inoculating grains with a contaminated culture.  Once inoculated, if the grains were properly sterilized, and the lid has a proper filter, there's little that can go wrong.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green every time what am I doing wrong? phenomenon?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
