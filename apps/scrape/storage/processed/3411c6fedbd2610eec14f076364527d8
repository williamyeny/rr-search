They'll dry out and have a very hard time pinning at 80%.  If the cake is already dry, you can re-hydrate it by first washing it under the faucet in the sink, then placing in a tub of water overnight with something on top to hold it down. We call this dunking. Add some ice to the water or put in the refrigerator to prevent bacteria buildup during the dunk.  After 12 to 24 hours, take it out, rinse well under the faucet again, and return to the fruiting chamber.   Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Contamination or what?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
