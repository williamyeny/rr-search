I wish everybody would quit making lc from unproved isolates, but as long as folks insist on squirting spores into sugar water, it's going to be hit or miss because you can't see bacteria in liquid culture with the naked eye.   You'd do yourself a favor by learning agar work, but barring that, you'd be miles ahead squirting spores into grains directly.   A jar of grains will colonize far faster than sugar water, and you'll know by the smell if it's contaminated or not.  Later you can do g2g, or make liquid mycelium from the colonized grains, resulting in far faster production of mycelium than a spore syringe to lc can ever provide.<br />RR","title":"Re: A few questions about grains and LCs","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
