They also won't take on any more water.  Once the kernel is saturated, it doesn't absorb any more, no matter how long you boil.<br /><br />After the soak, add hot tap water to the soak water if necessary to fill the kettle as full as you can before placing on the stove.  Heat to boiling, and then after several minutes, pour the water off.  Shake the colanders so the steam can evaporate off the kernels, drying them.  That's the main purpose of the boil, besides killing the germinated bacteria before pouring it down the drain.  It also gives the grains sort of a pre-sterilization prior to the PC cycle.<br /><br />Don't skip the gypsum.  It's worth a trip to the nursery.<br />RR","title":"Re: soaking rye with hot water, hydrating process","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
