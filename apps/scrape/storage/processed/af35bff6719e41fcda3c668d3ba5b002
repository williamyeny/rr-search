I'd suggest just not worrying about light during colonization, because enough will filter in through windows, etc., to provide the necessary small boost.&nbsp; The main thing is don't worry about trying to colonize in darkness, which was incorrect 30 years ago and still is.&nbsp; If your colonization room window faces the sun, keep the curtains mostly closed until fruiting time to keep the bright direct light out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is Colour Temperature Important on Colonizing Mycelium?"}}
