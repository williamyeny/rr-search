They usually make things worse by quickly drying out your substrate/cakes, especially if you're not there to replenish lost moisture. The shotgun is designed to create airflow without the use of fans, acting as a miniature weather system. Air is pulled in from the bottom of the chamber and through the perlite. The cooler air within the damp perlite is slightly more dense than the warmer air above, causing air to flow upward towards lower pressure, regardless of temperature. This airflow results in evaporative cooling within the perlite, perpetuating the flow as long as the air above is at a slightly lower pressure.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Thanks.&nbsp; Saved me having to type all that for the thousandth time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cigar box humidifier?"}}
