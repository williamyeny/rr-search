It isn't about potency.<br /><br />Popcorn is a poor choice for spawn due to the large kernel size which means there is fewer kernels in each jar, thus much less mycelium in each jar.  Smaller grains such as rye or wbs have more inoculation points as said above, but also have much more mycelium in them at full colonization due to the mycelium colonizing the surface of the grains.  Remember, smaller kernels means much more total surface area.<br /><br />Popcorn also harbors many more bacterial endospores than other grains, so the incidence of some of them surviving the pressure cooker is higher.<br />RR","title":"Re: Popcorn VS Bird Seed","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
