Another easy way to tell bruising from green molds is to look at the spot with a magnifying glass.  Bruising will be the actual color of the mycelium, while trichoderma spores will be sitting on <i>top of the mycelium</i> as a separate layer.  You can see this with the naked eye, but a magnifying glass makes it much more distinct.  Remember, some strains such as Redboy bruise green, so don't throw out something until you've checked closely.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this contamination or just blueing? (please help)"}}
