For example, as humans grow, they produce more cells.

A fully mature mushroom has the same amount of cells (and thus, psilocybin content) as when it was a pin. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />This is incorrect.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium and mycelium grows via cell division.&nbsp; A fully mature mushroom has more cells than a pin.&nbsp; I'm sure there's also some swelling going on as the cells engorge with water, but it's certainly not an either/or thing.<br /><br />Smaller fruits on a substrate are generally more potent per gram than larger fruits on the same substrate though.&nbsp; That's a fact.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is mushroom size contradictory to content?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
