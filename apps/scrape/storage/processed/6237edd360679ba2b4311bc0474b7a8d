My youngest son returned from two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan(Marine Recon) last year safely.&nbsp; I spent nearly every night of those three years sleepless worrying about him.&nbsp; I'm certain that your parents and other loved ones are doing the same.<br />RR","title":"Re: Well I dropped the 44 bucks on the RR DVDs","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
