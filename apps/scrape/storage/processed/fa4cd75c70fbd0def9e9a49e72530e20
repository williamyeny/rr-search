As fahtster said above, direct rain is fine because they're also surrounded by fresh air, being outdoors.<br /><br />However, I'd give a bit more air exchange to those.  The long stems and small caps are an indicator of not enough fresh air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Direct Misting!!!! I have had it up to here with you guys","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
