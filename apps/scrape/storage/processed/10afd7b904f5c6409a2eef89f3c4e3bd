You want to use hydrated lime or calcium carbonate for pH adjustment.  However, hydrated lime is water soluable so it balances the pH right away.  Calcium carbonate is a long term buffer that is better suited to gardens, since mushroom casing layers are not used long term.  Search my posts and hydrated lime for a good starting point on how much to use.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hydrated Lime Burning?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
