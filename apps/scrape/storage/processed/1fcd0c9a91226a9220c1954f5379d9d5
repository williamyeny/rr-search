Was there only one that showed no growth?  A 10ml syringe will inoculate at least 10 pf jars, so how did the other nine fare?<br /><br />I always flame the needle, and then almost immediately inject.  This ensures the needle is clean and contaminant free.  The first drop of solution might sizzle a bit, but then the rest can flow unimpeded and sterile.  Flame between each jar, but not between holes in the same jar.  This prevents cross-contamination should the sterilization process not have been complete in one or two jars.<br /><br />Growth is usually noticable within a week.  Many experienced growers have their jars fully colonized after two to three weeks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycelium not growing, NOTHING growing","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
