But don't get mad if your jars get contaminated after being almost 80% colonized.<br /><br />If you really want to put them in the oven ....I'd suggest:<br /> placing lids on the bottom of a pot<br /><br /> putting the jars in the pot<br /><br /> filling the pot with water until it is a little past the base of the jars<br /><br />THEN putting the jars in the oven<br /><br />Once you hear the water in the pot that is inside of your oven boiling start your 90 minute count down...Keep the oven at 250f by the way<br /></blockquote><br /><br />^^^ Everyone just sort of skipped over that...<br /><br />Technically if the guy REALLY wanted to put it in the oven.... I mean...he could put the jars in a pot of water like mentioned by me earlier (that no one seemed to acknowledge)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's not going to work out either.&nbsp; First of all, air is a horrible heat transfer mechanism.&nbsp; It would take hours to heat the pot of water and jars using a 250F oven.&nbsp; Then, once the water boiled, what do you suspect will happen to the steam which is at 212F when it contacts the sides of the pot at 250F?<br /><br />I take advantage of superheating in my wood fired steam boiler, but it's also a sealed unit.<br />RR","title":"Re: Baking rather than boiling or pressure cooking"}}
