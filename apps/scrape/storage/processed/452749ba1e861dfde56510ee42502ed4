Unless you're trying to grow in a cold basement, you don't need an incubator. I only use a simple bookshelf in normal room temperature.  Jars are exposed to regular room light from day one, and no extra heat is applied. Colonization speeds are normal.  In fact, I'll say this again, any temperature over 80F is going to be counterproductive.  Molds and bacteria will be encouraged more than mycelium.  Good luck with your grow.<br />RR","title":"Re: fanning the incubator!!?!?"}}
