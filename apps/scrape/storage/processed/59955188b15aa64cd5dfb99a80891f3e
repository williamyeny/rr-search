I absolutely love this - it's alot of fun:)<br /><br />Unfortunately, my 2nd PF tek grow has been a non-event. No worries whatsoever. I'm not freakin out. Just having fun learning.<br /><br />I made 24 BRF cakes, inoculated them, about a half dozen blasted out of the gates and colonized in a week, another half dozen were a week behind these, another 6 are maybe a week behind those, and the last 6 I'm questioning whether they'll ever do anything - there is some very light myc growth; but, it's been awhile now and nothing's really happening with these.<br /><br />of those that have colonized to date, i let them consolidate, dunk-n-rolled em, and then put them in my SGFC (see pic) which does maintain at least 95% humidity. these cakes get misted perhaps 5 to 6 times per day, and get fanned after each misting. funny thing is - this time around - nothing is happening. the oldest cakes have now been in the FC for 10 days and absolutely nothing. well, i say nothing, but some are growing this cotton looking stuff (see pic). any idea what this white stuff is? if it's cotton, i'll knit some panties. lol<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-25/011145926-SGFC.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/12-25/011145926-thumb_SGFC.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-25/011146299-cotton.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/12-25/011146299-thumb_cotton.jpg\"></a><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Looks like mold to me.&nbsp; I say it will be green in a few days.<br /><br />By the way, <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">BRF cakes</a> don't colonize in a week with mushroom mycelium.&nbsp; That's about how long it takes to see the first signs of germination.<br />RR","title":"Re: 2nd Grow & I'm Harvesting Cotton (Pic)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
