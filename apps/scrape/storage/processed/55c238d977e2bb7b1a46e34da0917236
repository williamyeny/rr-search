I'll also take one or two bags out of each batch to G2G for the next batch.&nbsp; At around the time of the 3rd G2G we'll inoculate a new grain master from a petri dish.&nbsp; By the time the first batch has reached 5 grain to grain transfers, the new grain masters are ready for their first.&nbsp; This keeps the cycle going indefinitely provided one keeps master culture slants in the refrigerator.<br />RR","title":"Re: g2g or glc"}}
