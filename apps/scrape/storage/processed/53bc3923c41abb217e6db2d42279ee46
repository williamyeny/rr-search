They're too large to stack properly.  If you want to isolate stains, you'll need at least a couple of dozen to get down to single sector isolates.  If you're just trying to isolate away from contaminants, you'll still go through a lot of dishes.  Pre-sterilized plastic petri dishes in a sterlile sleeve of 20 can be purchased for a dime each.   You can't wash and/or sterilize glass dishes and especially jars for that.","title":"Re: agar Q","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
