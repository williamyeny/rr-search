As stated on the title, it's my first time grow and it's coming up to the fourth week (as of tomorrow) since inoculation.&nbsp; I only&nbsp; done 4 jars and all appear to be fine so far with no contamination!&nbsp; <br /><br />However all the jars have some condensation and the one that has made the greatest progress appears to have quite a lot of condensation.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's normal or not.&nbsp; It's not so great that it's pooling at the bottom or anything, but after coming this far I'd be really sad to see it developing some mould or something else that will ruin the jar!&nbsp; <br /><br />I've attached a pic and I'm hoping someone can advise what I should do?<br /><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimageshack.com%2Fa%2Fimg546%2F5986%2Fqrby.jpg\">&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's just from the temperature differential.&nbsp; When it cools off in your house at night, the inside of the jars stays warm, thus the condensation.&nbsp; That's not an excessive amount.<br />RR","title":"Re: First Time Grow...Condensation Question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
