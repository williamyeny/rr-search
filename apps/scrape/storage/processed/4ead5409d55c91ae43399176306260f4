I'd suggest tossing those out and starting over.  Bacterial contamination is the most likely culprit.<br />A 1/2\" hole in the lid is way too much for a small jar.  In fact, with quart jars, I only use three to four 1/16\" holes for gas exchange.  A large hole will not only dry out your grains, but can lead to pinning before full colonization.<br />Start over, and pay very close attention to the moisture content of your grains prior to loading the jars.  1/2 pints are great for the pf tek, but also not well suited for grains.  At the minimum get 1 pint jars, but I suggest using quarts.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: WBS Incubation problem?"}}
