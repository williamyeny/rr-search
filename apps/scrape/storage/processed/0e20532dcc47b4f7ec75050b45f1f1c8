Don't try to seal around the edges at all.  For larger trays or bins, if you're afraid the paper will 'stick' to the substrate, simply wrinkle it up a bit before you lay it down.  I've also used the metal rings from mason jars as a spacer to keep the wax paper just above the surface of the casing layer.  You can remove the jar rings when the fruits are big enough to begin pushing the wax paper out of the way as they grow.   This is also an excellent preventative for cracked caps if your humidity drops too low while you're away at work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wax Paper"}}
