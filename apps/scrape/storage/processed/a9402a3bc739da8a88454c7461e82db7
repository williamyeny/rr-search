That spreads it even more.&nbsp; As already said, your spawn was contaminated, and yes, exposure to light and fresh air will trigger the mold to be active towards sporulation, just like it does with mushroom mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trichoderma showing off after introducing light and FAE to my monotub","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
