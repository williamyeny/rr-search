Personally, I've seen little benefit to adding a casing layer over bulk substrates with cubensis.  Very experienced growers can definitely get a boost with a well managed casing, but for the majority of new growers, I feel you'd be better off getting your feet wet by fruiting uncased. Of course, straight rye or wbs requires a casing to perform well, but bulk substrates such as coir or manure do not. You can dunk the coir/coffee substrate, and then introduce directly to fruiting conditions.  This way, you get your harvest a bit sooner, and don't have the other problems to deal with that casing causes. As you gain experience, add casing layers to future crops.   You can lay a sheet of wax paper over the uncased substrate to hold a high humidity right at the substrate surface, which will stimulate pinning.  Lift it up to fan several times per day, and replace with a fresh sheet every two to three days, or if/when it gets damp.<br />RR","title":"Re: coir and gypsum","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
