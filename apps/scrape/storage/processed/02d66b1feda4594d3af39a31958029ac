Filters are not required.  As said above, air exchange is the key to avoiding contaminants.<br /><br />Bacteria is the contaminant to watch for during colonization of your jars. Proper sterilization and cleanroom procedures will eliminate it from the brf. Once colonized, the myceium can fight bacteria off on its own.<br /><br />Molds, such as trichoderma and cobweb are the contaminants to watch for in the fruiting chamber.  Proper air exchange will prevent these. Pasteurize your casing mix, don't sterilize it.  A sterilized casing will be more prone to contamination than a pasteurized one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Contamination Probabilities"}}
