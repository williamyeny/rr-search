Adding a pinch of gypsum will help with clumping, but my main gripe with that mehod is it doens't rinse the grains first to get rid of the dust and chaff that causes clumping.  Lately, Paul shows that method without measuring at all.  Simply fill the jar about half full with grains, then add water until it barely covers the top of the grains, then add a pinch of gypsum and PC.  It works ok, but I still prefer my method even though it's more work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Preparing Rye Grain ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
