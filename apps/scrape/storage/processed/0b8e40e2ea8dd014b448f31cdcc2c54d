That's why we banished talk of 'strains' to the bastard stepchild of a thread that is a sticky on the top of the page.  The useless information repeated endlessly up there would just get endlessly repeated down here, cluttering up the forum from the actually important parts of growing, such as sterile technique, substrates, fruiting conditions, terrarium building, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />If you don't know which strain to pick, use roadkills method and put names of 'strains' on each section of a dartboard, and then throw a dart.  The strain the dart hits is the one you should order for best results, fastest colonization, contamination resistance, and maximum potency above all others.<br />RR","title":"Re: strain discussion ?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
