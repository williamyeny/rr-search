When green molds show up during colonization of bulk substrates, especially coir, it means the spawn itself was contaminated.  On wood based substrates, you can use salt to cover the spot, but that's because trichoderma will only be on the surface of the wood and easy to kill.  With manure/compost/coir, the trichoderma will be coming from deep within and not easy to kill.  It's best to toss the project and start over.
