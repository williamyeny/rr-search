Temperature drop is not a pinning trigger with tropical species.<br /><br />Expose to light from the time you put the casing layer on, if not before.&nbsp; In fact, there's no reason at all to colonize in darkness, which delays the eventual pinset.<br /><br />Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger because it causes an evaporation of moisture from the substrate.&nbsp; Three air exchanges per day is not enough.&nbsp; Four per hour is recommended.&nbsp; I'd suggest drilling a lot more holes in your terrarium to get the air moving in there.&nbsp; In fact, you could take the lid completely off and use wax paper to hold a high humidity right at the surface.<br /><br />You want bright, high frequency light.&nbsp; 6500 Kelvin which you'll get from fluorescent tubes labeled 'natural daylight' is about perfect, or a bright window will do as well.&nbsp; A few minutes of direct sunlight each day will often trigger a stubborn project into fruiting as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Overlay??"}}
