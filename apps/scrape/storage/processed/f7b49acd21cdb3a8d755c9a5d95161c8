Dust masks are intended to stop the individual from inhaling large particles such as dust and dirt when mowing the lawn, but <i>surgical</i> masks are called for when doing mycology work.  A surgical mask is designed to protect a patient from the surgeons exhaled bacteria, which is what we want to accomplish when doing sterile work.<br /><br />While the pf tek is more forgiving than most methods, use it to learn the proper techniques so that when you move on to more difficult tasks, you will already have an understanding of what's required.<br /><br />In short, I'll never recommend the easiest, cheapest, or laziest method of growing, but you can bet your last dollar that if I recommend something, that it will work.  It would be nice if everyone would also do the same.  That would clear up a lot of the confusion that new growers face with all the conflicting advice they receive.<br />RR","title":"Re: So, my wife wants to help knock up some jars..."}}
