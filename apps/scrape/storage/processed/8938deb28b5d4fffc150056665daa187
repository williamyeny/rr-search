Personally, if I don't use straw within a day or two I toss it out and start over.  With manure, if not used within a week I'll just re-pasteurize to be safe.  Other growers have let these go longer and been successful, but it's so easy to pasteurize again, I hate to take the chance.<br />RR","title":"Re: How long does pasteurized poo/straw last without colonization?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
