You failed to say what your casing layer is composed of, but the majority of times I've seen casing layers colonize fully is when somebody uses coir instead of a traditional casing material such as peat or jiffy mix.  If so, patching with even more coir will keep the mycelium in veg, preventing fruiting. Take hyphae's advice on fae, and up your humidity back where you had it.   A fully colonized casing should be treated as an uncased substrate for best results.<br />RR","title":"Re: When its ok to patch and when its not ok to patch..
