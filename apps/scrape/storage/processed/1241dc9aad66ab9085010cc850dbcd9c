ALL of the flow hoods I have seen have the filter raised about an inch above the countertop, essentially the width of the filter frame and the bottom of the box. So, if the flow hood is blowing out a laminar flow of essentially sterile air, that clean air will miss the bottom inch directly above the countertop. Am I right to assume that contaminated air sneaks into that space? </blockquote><br />That is correct.&nbsp; Dirty air will also carburete into that space from the edges.<br />I use a wire rack in front of the&nbsp; flowhood to elevate petri dishes into the flow.&nbsp; Another method is to have three our four empty petri dishes in front of the hood to set the ones you're working on.&nbsp; You can look at the clips on my website for agar work and strain isolation to see the rack in use.<br />RR","title":"Re: question regarding laminar flow"}}
