Normal room light has no effect on anything during the colonization phase.  I've proved that by many years of colonizing jars at room temperature and exposed to normal room lighting from the day of inoculation.<br /><br />Consolidation is the part of the process where the mycelium has finished 'colonizing' the substrate, but has not had had time to digest enough of the food to be able to fruit readily.  This is the reason for leaving brf in the jars for a week past full colonization.  If you birth right away at full colonization, they won't fruit for a week anyway, so may as well leave them in the jars during that time so they're not drying out.<br /><br />The above assumes that your jars colonized very fast in a properly prepared substrate that remained contaminant free.  Obviously if the jars took two months to colonize, and/or there's bacteria in the jars, they could even start fruiting invitro prior to full colonization.<br /><br />Stamets also explains the idea of consolidation in his books.  It's not necessary with grains if you're going to be spawning to bulk or using for grain to grain transfers, but you do need to wait for full colonization.  However, with pf cakes and other bulk substrates, it helps to wait some time after full colonization before initiating fruiting conditions.  Doing so results in more prolific flushes.  Failure to do so with some of the harder to grow edibles such as P nameko and Shiitake sometimes results in no flush at all.<br />RR","title":"Re: Biology behind mycelial \"consolidation\"?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
