If they contaminate prior to fist flush, it means your spawn was contaminated. Save your lime for the casing, should you decide to use one.&nbsp; My experience is that a casing layer isn't going to help that much.&nbsp; Uncased coir and straw fruit great by themselves.<br />RR","title":"Re: opinions on casing or not casing a coir spawn?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
