Incubators cause way more problems then they solve.  I haven't used one in years.  Glass is an insulator and holds heat very well.  I've seen up to a ten degree increase over ambient in the temperature inside the quart jars of grains, when a thermocouple is inserted into the center of the jar.<br /><br />The other problem with using a tub as an incubator is stale air. It does little good to have filters and holes in your lids if they all just vent into a sealed tub.  <br /><br />Normal room temperature is fine for colonization of mycelium.  Colonization speed peaks in the 75F to 81F range, and falls off dramatically above 83F.  Stamets published a chart in one of his books that said 86F is the fastest for growth, and that is just plain wrong.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is my incubator too hot?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
