It's true that when used like that it has little to no NPK value, however NPK is not used in mycology.  Coir is a rich fungi food, easily the equal of manure or straw.  For the most bang, mix it with manure, worm castings, coffee grinds and straw.  Add gypsum and pasteurize before use.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coir","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
