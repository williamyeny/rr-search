It doesn't matter if they're mold or mushroom.  Because of so many previous edible grows, I'm horribly allergic to the spores of <i>H. ulmarius</i>, and simply can't grow that delicious species anymore.  For me, it causes lung inflammation and a migraine headache that doesn't go away for days, on just a slight exposure.<br /><br />Persons with AIDS have been found to have trichoderma actively colonizing their lung tissue, so if anyone here has AIDS, they'd be advised to provide plenty of fresh air to their projects to ensure they don't breathe the spores.<br /><br />Many new growers have a hard time differentiating the difference between breathing concentrated spores from fungi, and eating mushrooms from a substrate that is moldy, which is harmless.<br /><br />Much more can be learned on Google than here.  Type 'mold' 'allergy' 'spores' for a start.<br /><br />I'll move this to the contamination forum since it's off topic here.<br />RR","title":"Re: The dangers of inhaling mold spores."}}
