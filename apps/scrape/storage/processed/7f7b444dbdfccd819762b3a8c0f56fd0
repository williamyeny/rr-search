I can cut 1\" thick milk thistle instantly with it.&nbsp; The cheap line just wraps around the milk thistle and jams. Another thing to watch is you don't want more than four to five inches of line out from the reel.&nbsp; If you have too much, it breaks off.<br />RR","title":"Re: Chopping Straw With A Weed Trimmer","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
