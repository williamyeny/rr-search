That's way too hot and will not only dry out your cakes, but will tend to stimulate molds.<br /><br />Next time, do a dunk and roll.&nbsp; Also, fresh air is the number one pinning trigger, so get more holes in your terrarium or fan more.&nbsp; Don't use a light bulb for mushrooms.&nbsp; Get a fluorescent lamp that is rated at 6500K.&nbsp; This is the color temperature that will give you the best performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: What am i doing wrong??
