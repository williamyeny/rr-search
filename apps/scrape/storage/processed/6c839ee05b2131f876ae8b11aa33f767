Don't try to mix ratios either.  In other words, it's silly to ask if one jar can spawn X amount of pounds.  A 'jar' can be 1/2 pint or five gallons.  If you're going to use volumetric measurements, stick with them.  One jar of spawn will inoculate five jars of manure, provided the same size jar is used.  If you go over one to five, you risk contaminants before the substrate can get colonized.  In addition, the grain or brf is a major supplier of nutrients, so don't cheap out on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: more hpoo less spawn..","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
