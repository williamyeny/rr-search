That's what you're seeing here.  Give your PE strain credit for hanging in there and working to overcome the contaminant.  <br /><br />Humidity is not the problem.  Perlite alone will deliver 99% humidity, so the ultrasonic is a bit of overkill, but as said, that isn't the problem.<br /><br />It was a mistake to throw out the cake that produced. PE is famous for producing mutated, gnarly looking fruitbodies. I see pins on another cake, so the growth that is producing fruits is the good stuff, the whispy, grey growth is the mold.<br /><br />If it happens to be cool and/or rainy where you live, you might try moving them outside to finish up.  Otherwise, pay close attention to the 'good' growth that is producing fruits and toss out any cakes that do not display that type of mycelium.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the fruits that grow from a cake with mold so don't toss them out.  Remember, in nature molds and mushroom mycelium all live in harmony and wild mushrooms are highly sought after.<br /><br />When this flush is over, I'd suggest cleaning out everything in your grow area and starting over fresh, unless you're in a climate that enables you to move them outside.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: PICTURES. what happened to my shrooms?"}}
