Rye grass seed is different.  It's the seed for lawn and pasture grass, and if you use it, you want to use 1/2 as much water by volume as grass seed.  For 1/2 liter by volume of grass seed, only use 1/4 liter of water.  The correct amount of gypsum to use in a jar is what you can hold in a pinch between your thumb and forefinger.<br /><br />If you use rye berries, rinse them very well before using. It's the dirt and chaff that makes them stick together later.  I use gypsum in rye berry jars as well.  Use equal amounts of water and grain by volume.<br />RR","title":"Re: Slimy rye"}}
