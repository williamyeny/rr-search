The reply below is one I posted in another thread earlier, so I'll take the liberty of cutting and pasting it here for those who would otherwise miss it.  Hopefully it will stimulate some more research and discussion on everyone's part and clear up a few things.  Here it is:<br /><br /><b>LIGHT IS NOT THE MAJOR PINNING TRIGGER FOR MUSHROOMS!</b><br /><br />In fact, light isn't even the major factor in which direction mushrooms grow. Wind or other air currents is the first. Light is the second, then finally gravity is the third.<br /><br />As for pinning, full colonization of the substrate is the most important pinning trigger. If there are contaminants present in a substrate, the mushroom mycelium generally stops growing when it contacts them. This represents full colonization because the mycelium has hit a natural barrier, and often pins begin to develop, whether light is present or not.<br /><br />The second most important pinning trigger is an increase in air exchange, with the corresponding drop in CO2 levels that occurs simultaneously. When you uncover a tray to look at it, you allow the CO2 to escape and be replaced by fresh air. THIS is a pinning trigger, even if you do it in the dark.<br /><br />Third, which goes along with second, is a steady rate of evaporation of moisture from the substrate or casing layer. In the artifical environment of a small tray, we must mist to keep the substrate or casing from drying out, but we also must allow that moisture to evaporate off between mistings.<br /><br />Fourth, when the above three triggers are active, light becomes a pinning/growth initiation factor.<br /><br />If one waits too long to apply the casing layer, or the other factors listed above are in effect prior to light OR the casing layer being applied, primordia will begin to form, which will then push up through to the surface, whether or not it has been fully or even partially colonized. By the same token, if light is applied and the other, more important factors have not been met, primordia will NOT form.<br /><br />This is why experienced growers, such as commercial spawn producers who make their entire living incubating mushroom mycelium, make absolutely NO effort to incubate in the dark. It isn't necessary. People will have much more success in the hobby when they understand that.<br />RR","title":"Attention New Growers - Pinset Initiation Factors"}}
