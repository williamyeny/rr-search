Ditto for peroxide, other than cobweb.  If a substrate is actively flushing, you can make it to harvest OK by applying a salt paste over the spot.  Cover the green spores and about an inch all the way around them with a wet, sticky salt paste.  Don't try to cut any part of it out, or you'll release billions of spores.  The salt paste will kill the spores and slow down the infection below.<br /><br />However, if it isn't fruiting yet, it probably won't and the mold is sure to come back.  If that's the case, toss it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mold/saving my casing."}}
