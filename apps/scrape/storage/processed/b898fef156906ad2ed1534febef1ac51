The second is that a high CO2 level impedes the growth of most competitor fungi, so if those organisms are present, your mushroom mycelium will be at an advantage. The third is we've found a reduction in CO2 along with the other pinning triggers helps contribute to great pinsets.<br />RR","title":"Re: does co2 buildup help initiate pinheads?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
