(resistance)  I'm using a 12 X 24 filter with a 500 cfm motor/blower combination, both rated at 1\" static pressure, and it's perfect at 135 feet per minute leaving the front of the flowhood.  Based on the above, it seems I should be getting 250 feet per minute of airspeed, but I don't.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's the \"Initial Resistance\" and \"Final Resistance\" about laminar flowhoods?"}}
