That encourages pinning below the substrate, and as you have seen, the mycelium reaches into the damp perlite, possibly waterlogging your substrate, which greatly reduces performance.<br /><br />In addition, 'drainage' holes drain the CO2, and you want the CO2 high in the substrate and low on top of the casing layer because that stimulates pinning where you want it to happen.<br /><br />For now, I'd suggest elevating the tray above the perlite for a simple fix.  Next time, don't drill holes in your tray.  <br />RR","title":"Re: mushrooms growing off perlite"}}
