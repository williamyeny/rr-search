They'll never colonize thick enough to hide the grains that are pressed up against the glass because there isn't room for that much mycelium.<br /><br />I disagree with more than one shake during colonization.  A shake at 20% to 40% will spread those kernels around, ensuring the rest is colonized within a few days.  After shaking, there's a 24 to 48 hour period where the mycelium is merely trying to recover from damage, but isn't growing into the new grains.  If you shake more than once, you force the mycelium to waste needless energy re-knitting, when it could be aggressively growing.  <br /><br />The same applies at the end.  Shake to loosen the grains, and then spawn them to your tray of manure or straw, etc.  Let them recover directly into the manure or casing layer.  If you shake, then allow to recover, they're damaged again by spawning, so must recover yet again.  My point is that shaking is abusive, but a necessary abuse.  Simply keep it to a minimum.<br />RR","title":"Re: help me","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
