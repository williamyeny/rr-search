For a quart jar, I use 1 1/4 cup of grass seed, and 5/8 cup of water.  Add a pinch of gypsum between your thumb and forefinger per jar.  Half the amount of water can be substituted with brewed coffee.<br /><br />I put a solid lid on the jar after mixing and shake well.  Allow to sit over night, then shake again.  Replace the solid lid with a filtered lid and PC for an hour at 15psi.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye grass seed for cubes (spawn only)"}}
