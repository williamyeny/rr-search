They're worthless, imo.  They cause too much turbulence in a room and seem to stir up the contaminants more than they filter them.  I actually have less contaminant trouble without them running.<br /><br />Mix up a 10% bleach solution and saturate everything in that room.  Walls, ceiling, carpet, bedding, curtains, etc., etc.   Fill the room up with a mist and close all the doors and windows.  Repeat hourly for half a day or so.  The bleach will kill the mold spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: what to do about a contam saturated room"}}
