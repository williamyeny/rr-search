They will be in a jar with holes and a filter of some sort.<br /><br />I've waited as long as two weeks to inoculate jars, but that is pushing your luck.  Do it as soon as possible.<br /><br />Gypsum won't lower the ph.  It is a buffer that tends to keep the ph at neutral.  Gypsum contains both calcium which raises ph, and sulphur, which lowers ph.  Between them they work to avoid swings in the ph.  Gypsum is great for use with rye berries, as both calcium and sulphur are necessary nutrients for fruitbody formation, and as an added benefit, the gypsum keeps the berries from sticking together.<br />RR","title":"Re: rye storage"}}
