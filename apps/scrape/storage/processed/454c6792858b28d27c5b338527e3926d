There's too much movement in your arms, and having both arms moving really blurs the picture. Put the jar down and rest the camera on a book or something.<br /><br />There's no way to tell from a blurry picture if it's mold or not.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mixing 2 strains in 1 jar?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
