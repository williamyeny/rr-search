You might try misting. Straw is hollow, so holds more moisture, but there's no way the primordia that are forming on individual pieces of straw will make it to maturity without aborting, so don't worry when they do.    With cubes, there really isn't much additional benefit to more than about three inches of substrate, unless it's mostly straw.  If the bottom is colonized solid, I'd scrape off the top part.  After a month, molds are sure to hit the uncolonized areas soon.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why is this happening!","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
