I use the antibiotic agar from fungi.com and fungi spores both perfect and imperfect germinate just fine on it.  Bacteria, when it's in sufficient quantities will also germinate and grow on it.  What the antibiotic agar does is slow the bacteria down enough to help you make transfers away from the contamination into a fresh dish that also has antibiotic agar.  Hopefully, your mushroom strain is strong enough to outrun the bacteria.<br /><br />If you have a clean print or syringe, there is no need to use the antibiotic agar.  I keep both on hand, but only use the antibiotic when absolutely necessary.<br />RR","title":"Re: antibiotic agar"}}
