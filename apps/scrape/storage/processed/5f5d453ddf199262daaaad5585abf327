If you do everything right, you should get 80% to 90% or so of your total possible product in the first two flushes.&nbsp; I never go for a third flush indoors, and usually move substrates outdoors after 1st flush.&nbsp; By then the mycelium is spent and it's normal for molds to move in.&nbsp; If it's taking more than two flushes to get to that point, work on fruiting parameters.<br />RR","title":"Re: rhododendron leaves in casing...
