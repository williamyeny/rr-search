I've been doing a lot of research and I think I have everything planned out for the most part, except for my actual container itself. I plan on doing a bulk monotub grow, and I want to use a cool mist for FAE and humidity. I think I know pretty much how to knock that out, but my real question is:<br /><br />I'm probably going to have to keep everything in a closet, because that's really the only room I have to do this. I know it's probably not a good idea to do this with a humidifier, as it may end up ruining the closet. Would I be able to put a bowl of desiccant outside of the tub, like on the floor or up on a shelf maybe, to keep the moisture levels outside of the tub at a minimum? Or would the desiccant end up pulling moisture out of the tub as well? I feel like it might end up working properly, but want to know what any of you guys think?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />No chance of that mess working.&nbsp; I'd suggest <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf cakes and a shotgun terrarium</a> to learn the basics.&nbsp; Leave it sitting on a shelf or table right out in the open.&nbsp; Hiding things is the surest way to call attention to them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Using desiccant to keep moisture levels down OUTSIDE of a monotub?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
