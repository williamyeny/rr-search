In other words, one cup of DE for each 20 cups of dry horse manure, etc.  I always mix all dry ingredients together first, then add water.  With DE, you'll think you have the moisture content right, then ten minutes later when you check, it's dry again.  The stuff really absorbs a lot of water.  I check and adjust at least three times at 20 minute intervals before loading into jars and pasteurizing. <br />RR","title":"Re: Looking for the DE threads","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
