Many city dwellers have posted coir grows that match anything I or anyone else have grown on manure.&nbsp; Furthermore, cubensis is a primary decomposer, which loves uncomposted substrates and will fruit well on coir, straw, and non-composted manure.&nbsp; Other species require organisms to partially break down the substrate first, but cubensis does not.<br />As for multiple flushes, a properly managed substrate will deliver 80% of its total potential in the first two flushes.&nbsp; Anyone getting more than three flushes has not managed the substrate properly, or it would be spent by then.&nbsp; Nobody gets three or more closed canopy flushes of wall to wall mushrooms.<br />As for microbes stimulating more prolific fruiting, I used to be on that bandwagon too until a few more years of experimenting proved that position to be incorrect. Certain species of agaricus for example will not fruit at all on sterilized substrates because they require that microbial interaction. However, this is not the case with cubensis.&nbsp; In other words, while a sterilized cubensis substrate can be more prone to contamination, it will fruit equally well to a pasteurized substrate with lots of microbes.&nbsp; This is a change in my position from several years ago based on additional knowledge and experience gained since then.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coco Coir vs Horse Poo"}}
