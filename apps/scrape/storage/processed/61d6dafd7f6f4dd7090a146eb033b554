An hour or two in a window with even direct sunlight is great to kickstart a pinset, but don't let the tub overheat.  For the rest of the cycle, find a way to get the flourescent to shine through the clear part of the tub.  Put the light in front of or behind the tub.   it doesn't have to come just from the top.  The white lid will reflect side light down just fine.  My entire greenhouse is lit from the back with flourescent fixtures attached to the wall the greenhouse sits against.<br /><br />Cool white fluorescents produce 5000k, which is very close to natural sunlight.  Incadescents are a much redder light and only produce at around 3200k, which is not nearly as effective.  You want high frequency light for best results.  The natural daylight flourescents are the best, putting out light at around 7000k, but are much more expensive than cool white.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lighting question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
