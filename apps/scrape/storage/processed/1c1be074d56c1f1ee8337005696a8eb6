If you buy a 'martha' type, it will be made in china and none of the plastic will be standard sizes like our pvc.<br /><br />Good luck piping in a humidifier and getting proper humidity with any life at all on the unit.&nbsp; It's better to set it on the floor to one side of your shelves with an empty space above so it can shoot its mist straight up unimpeded.&nbsp; You only need about 14\" of extra space that way.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question for the mini greenhouse owners"}}
