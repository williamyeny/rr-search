For years, I grew mushrooms and plants in the same room with metal halide 400s.&nbsp; While the color temperature of the halides is pretty low compared to fluorescent(4,000 Kelvin), the intensity of the 400 watts makes up for it.&nbsp; If you're using sodium vapor lamps, they're a bit too red to give the best results, so in that case, I'd go with the fluorescent right above the fruiting chamber as shown above.<br />RR","title":"Re: lighting"}}
