People were always saying perlite is needed for better humidity. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />You are absolutely wrong.  It's disingenuous to say the least, to show a picture of an empty terrarium with perlite and a totally dry hygrometer reading 97% humidity, followed by a picture of a loaded terrarium with substrate trays and an obviously soaking wet from being sprayed hygrometer showing 99% humidity.<br /><br />I can spray water on a hygrometer in the middle of the desert and make it read 99%.  What we need for mushroom growing is a <b>high humidity coupled with lots of fresh air exchange</b>.  The humidity must remain high while air is being constantly exchanged.  Standing water will only evaporate so much, and certainly not enough to maintain humidity with four to five air exchanges per hour as recommended.  I can set a bucket of water out and very little will evaporate from it.  In fact, it would go stagnant before it would evaporate dry in a tub.<br /><br />Perlite humidification has been proved by countless experienced growers for many years because the rate of evaporation from it will keep up with the massive amount of air exchange required for mushroom cultivation.  It's the way to go, and when you can layer it four inches deep for only a dollar or two worth of perlite, it's much cheaper even than any other method.<br />RR","title":"Re: no need for Perlite (pics)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
