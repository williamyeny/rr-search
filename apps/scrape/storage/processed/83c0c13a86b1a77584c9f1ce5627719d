The casing is only the non-nutritious top layer added to the top of the <i>substrate</i> after full colonization.  Don't refer to the whole project as a 'casing'.  That's an improper use of nomenclature.  If everyone would stop doing that, new folks wouldn't get so confused about casing.   The word 'casings' in the plural should never be used.
