When they're fully colonized, plant them into a bed of chips/sawdust outdoors, but don't break up the sawdust/chips from the bag, as they might not have time to recover setting them out in July, which is about when they'll be ready.  You should get a small fruiting from the area the original bags were placed.  Don't pick more than ten to twenty percent of the fruits the fist year.  Allow the natural process of slugs, bugs, birds, etc., to eat them and spread the patch.<br />RR","title":"Re: outdoor cultivation","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
