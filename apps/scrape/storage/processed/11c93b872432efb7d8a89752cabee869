You increased your chances of contamination substantially.&nbsp; Never leave uncovered grains on top of a substrate.&nbsp; They'll dry out, which slows the mushroom mycelium down or even kills it outright, and then mold spores will land on the grains and germinate.&nbsp; Always cover your grains with at least a thin layer of substrate material such as coir.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing with coir.
