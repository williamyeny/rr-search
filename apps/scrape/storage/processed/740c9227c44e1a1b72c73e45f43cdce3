That way when I need to look at something, I just pick it up and look at it.  There is no need to keep jars in the dark.  That is a myth that has held over from the agaricus growers.  It's very rare for a strain to pin prior to full colonization, but it does happen from time to time.  No need to worry though, if you're building casings or doing grain to grain transfers, simply dump the grains and pins right into the casing or next jar of grains.  The mushrooms from within a sterile jar are also sterile.  Since fruits are mycelium, they clone right into the grains and don't contaminate.  I've done this many times.<br />Also, blue light does not cause pinning.  What stamets and others have found is that a light rich in the blue spectrum will tend to help give a 'better' pinset.  Cultivators who have grown mushies in the same room with their garden and exposed the mushrooms to light from a MH lamp know they get somewhat better pinsets then they get with incadescent or fluorescent fixtures.<br />RR","title":"Re: photographer's dark room light... for incubation viewing?"}}
