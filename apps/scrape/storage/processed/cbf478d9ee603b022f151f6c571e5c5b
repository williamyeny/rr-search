Incandescent bulbs burn with a red color at about 3,000K.  You want at a minimum to use cool white fluorescent with a color temp of 5,000 Kelvin, but a daylight fluorescent lamp at 6,500 Kelvin is better yet.  Get a 15 watt, 6,500K compact fluorescent, and you'll be miles ahead and only use 1/4 as much electricity.<br />RR","title":"Re: there up and running but not quite as high up as you would expect","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
