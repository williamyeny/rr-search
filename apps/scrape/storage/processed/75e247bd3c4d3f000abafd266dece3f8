I use a proved strain on a petri dish, and eberbach it into an LC for inoculations six days later at most.  However, this procedure is out of reach for those without agar skills, a microscope to verify a clean culture, an eberbach autoclavable blender, and a flowhood.<br /><br />What I hate is the constant advice from noobs to other noobs to inject a spore syringe into karo water and hope for the best.  I've seen many new growers around here give up after a few tries with LC and lose interest in the hobby.  If they had simply followed established procedure, they would have grown mushrooms instead of molds.<br />RR","title":"Re: can trich live dormant"}}
