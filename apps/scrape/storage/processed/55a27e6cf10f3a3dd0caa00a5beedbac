Put your terrarium on a shelf or table.<br /><br />Secondly, for terrariums, you can't beat perlite humidification.  Two to three inches of damp, but not wet perlite will easily give you 99% humidity for three to four weeks, which is plenty of time needed for a crop cycle.<br /><br />To get fresh air in and stale air out, simply leave the lid a bit crooked.
