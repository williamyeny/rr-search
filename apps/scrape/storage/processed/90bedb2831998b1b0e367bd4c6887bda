The grains should be hydrated slowly to prevent bursting.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />then stick it threw the filter disc so that the hole in the jar lid is not going to expose the hole in the filter disc.<br /></blockquote><br />You don't want to puncture your filter disks.  In addition, rotating the lid won't stop contaminants from going through the hole you make in the filter.  Air, and the contaminants within will take the path of least resistance, which is through the hole rather than through the filter material.  It also helps to have the filter disk on the outside of the lid so it stays totally dry.  A filter on the inside runs a risk of getting damp from condensation, which then allows contaminant molds and bacteria to colonize through the filter material and into the grains below.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Mycelium will occur a thermal death at a temperature of 106F but, if your temperature is at 86F you won't have to worry about that. <br /></blockquote><br />Actually, thermal death comes much higher, despite what you'll read elsewhere.  I've heated mycelium to 120F for half an hour in LC to kill off virus.  That temperature kills the virus but leaves the mushroom mycelium unharmed.  However, 86F is a few degrees past the point of fastest growth with cubensis, and it doesn't account for the 2 to 5 degrees of temperature rise due to thermogenesis.  Growth with cubensis begins to decline at 83F, and that's when measured inside the jar.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend a colonization temp over 80F.  When large spawn bags are used instead of jars, stick to 75F.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: TheNewGuy's Rye Prep Tek"}}
