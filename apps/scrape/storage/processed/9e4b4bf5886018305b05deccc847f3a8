However, despite their efforts, they got fruits.&nbsp; They then attributed the fact that their trays fruited to the cold shock, and a myth was born.<br /><br />In the summer months, if your 'cold' water is pretty warm, I'd suggest dunking in the refrigerator, just to prevent any fermentation while the cake is underwater.&nbsp; The rest of the year, just use cold tap water and dunk at normal room temp.&nbsp; More valuable then using cold water though is the rinse before and after the dunk with running water.&nbsp; You'll notice the cakes are somewhat slimy after a dunk.<br />RR","title":"Re: cold shocking"}}
