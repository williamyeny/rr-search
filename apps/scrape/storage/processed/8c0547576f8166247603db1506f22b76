I'm all for research and development, and the ways we grow mushrooms today are quite a bit different than they were even five years ago when NOBODY thought coir could be used as a substrate.&nbsp; Experimenting is what keeps our hobby fluid, and I hope that never changes.&nbsp; Just try to avoid posting the cart before the horse, if that makes sense. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/peace.gif\" alt=\":peace:\" title=\":peace:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: Brassinolide and P.cube: Increased yield and growth...How-To","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
