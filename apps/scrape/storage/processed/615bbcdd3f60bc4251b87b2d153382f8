The thermal mass of all that water slows the cool down phase which is where most people boil over their agar. After you turn the heat on 'high' and vent steam for five minutes until it's shooting out pretty strong, put the weight on to build pressure.&nbsp; <br /><br />The key element is to watch your PC as the pressure increases, so you can throttle the stove burner down as pressure is reached.&nbsp; Don't allow the weight to jiggle <b>at all</b>.&nbsp; When the weight rattles, your bottle of agar boils over.&nbsp; Thus, you want to intercept the pressure increase so it stops at no greater than 14.5 psi.&nbsp; Try to keep the pressure as steady as you can by using your stove control. 13psi to 14psi is fine.<br /><br />During the cooldown phase, you want pressure to drop very slowly, so turn the stove back on a few times as pressure drops to slow the process.&nbsp; This also prevents boilover, because the hot agar in the 'insulated' glass container doesn't cool off as fast as the PC itself, thus the boilover problem.<br /><br />As for contaminants getting sucked in, they do, but if you'll follow the suggestions to filter the lid, and then cover it with foil the way we do with jars, that won't be a problem.&nbsp; At the time Paul wrote that book, and even into the 90s, he was still preparing agar in a flask.&nbsp; That's why he had to be so careful about using a sterilizer rather than a PC.&nbsp; Using the methods outlined above, you can do agar work with a PC, which is how it's shown in the DVD.<br />RR","title":"Re: beginning agar question","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
