Quarts aren't used with brf because it takes forever to colonize and the brf is likely to spoil before full colonization.  The growth on the other side looks good, so you might just let it rip and see what happens.  If the orange spots grow or the stink gets worse, toss it out.  In the meantime, start more jars with what you learned from that one. Get 1/2 pint wide mouth jars so the cake can just drop right out when it's ready. It takes a few tries to get it right.  Hang in there.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is/caused this contam?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
