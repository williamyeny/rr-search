You used hydroponic plant solution?  The growth you describe sounds like cobweb to me.  It grows thin and whispy and you see right through it to whatever is below.  If it's on a cake, it can look quite white.  When it's on a casing layer, the brown below makes the Dactylium look much greyer.  If you dunked in a nutrient solution, that is much more likely to be the case.  You don't need to feed the mycelium once fruiting begins.  Your original substrate is all it needs, and any addition is going to feed new mold mycelium, not the mushroom mycelium.<br /><br />I'd suggest spraying it with peroxide at 3%.  That is the strength it's sold at over the counter in the US.  Simply put the spray attachment into the bottle of peroxide and mist the cake or pour it full strength into your misting bottle.  If it's cobweb, it will melt and dissappear on contact with the peroxide.   If all it does is sizzle a bit, but not dissappear, it's probably mushroom mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: white and puffy looking"}}
