That's why it's mixed with water.  The reason is that alcohol kills when it evaporates away from whatever it is in.  Cells, including bacteria cells admit water through osmosis, but reject toxins.  By mixing water into the alcohol, the cell is tricked into admitting it, then when the alcohol evaporates away, it kills the organism.  Bacterial endospores are in grains, but we PC for those.  The use of 70% alcohol is great for tables, gloves, needles, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: According to this, alcohol is pointless...","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
