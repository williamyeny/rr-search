Trich also loves wet surfaces, uncolonized surfaces, and exposed grain on the surface, whether or not they are colonized already with mushroom mycelium.<br /><br />It isn't an either/or scenario.&nbsp; You want fresh air, AND moving air.&nbsp; Both will help to fight molds and promote mushroom growth.&nbsp; The main reason we air out our grow areas is to stimulate pinning and fruit development, which can't happen in CO2 laden air.&nbsp; The fighting molds aspect is a side-benefit.<br /><br />Mushroom mycelium can tolerate a high CO2 level.&nbsp; However, it doesn't stimulate it to pin.&nbsp; For pinning you want a low CO2 level, not more than twice ambient.&nbsp; If there's a dozen or more substrates in a closed up closet, the CO2 level will go to 5,000 ppm within a few hours, even if there is a fan going.&nbsp; The air is still stale, just moving.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fresh air and Green molds","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
