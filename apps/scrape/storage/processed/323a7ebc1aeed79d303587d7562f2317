If they're going to recover, they will have by then.  Normally they're finished within two to three weeks, so in another week, if you still have nothing, boil them for a couple of hours, then clean out the contents and start over.<br />RR","title":"Re: Jars incubating smell like ROTTEN EGGS (sulfur)","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
