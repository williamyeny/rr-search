I think I may have even seen you quoted saying that it would be like wiping shit on your face after a shower, lol.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I've been under the impression since day 1 that flame sterilizing your needle in between jars is necessary to prevent cross contamination. Is this untrue or is the alcohol swab the only issue here?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry to bother but I've been cooling my needles with iso since I started growing, and would like to stop if it really is hurting more than helping. It just seems to me that if i shoved a red hot needle into an injector port it would melt the silicone, or at least burn up the first ML of glc coming through the needle<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks and my apologies for bothering with silly questions (: <br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>RogerRabbit said:</b><br />Flame only, never wipe with alcohol.&nbsp; I've been very clear about that forever.&nbsp; Please ask cultivation questions in the forum,&nbsp; not PM.<br />RR <br /></blockquote><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Why would you lie about such a thing?<br />RR","title":"Re: Flaming needles between jars","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
