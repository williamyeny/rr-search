Once pressure is reached, turn down your stove to the lowest setting that will allow a slight hiss, but no rattling. Order a nozzle now, and you should be able to find a gauge in AU from any boiler supply.&nbsp; The thread size is 1/8\" NPT.&nbsp; The boiler shop will know what that means.&nbsp; 15 psi is the same as 100 kpa, or 1 atmosphere, if that's how the gauges are marked there.<br /><br />Be sure to lube the matching surfaces with Vaseline or olive oil.&nbsp; It's also a good idea to remove the wing nuts, and grease the threads on the bolts.&nbsp; This will make it tighten and loosen easier.<br /><br />Very nice score.&nbsp; That would be a bargain at three times the price.<br />RR","title":"Re: AA 925 Pressure Cooker Question"}}
