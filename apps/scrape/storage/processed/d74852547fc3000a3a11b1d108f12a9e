You need at least 1\" of air space below the terrarium. Your humidity will actually increase if you'll follow the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">tek</a>.&nbsp; The only problem I see is those appear to be larger than 1/4\" holes(6mm).&nbsp; It must be remembered that a 1/2\" hole is 4 times as large as a 1/4\" hole, so by going larger you can screw things up.<br />RR","title":"Re: My Shotgun FC....Overkill on the holes?
