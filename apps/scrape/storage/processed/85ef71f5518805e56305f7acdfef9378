Substrates with a steady-state moisture content will just sit there and not fruit.&nbsp; This is also the reason we use foil under the cakes-to prevent them from absorbing water from the perlite.&nbsp; You might find the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek</a> helpful and up to date.&nbsp; The third video of that series describes the shotgun terrarium, which will out perform the old fish aquarium idea.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>JERSEYGROWN said:</strong><br />Just like \"back in the day\" we weren't dunking our cakes and rolling them in verm until one day, someone created a thread that said something like.....\"How About Dunking Cakes in Water Before Fruiting\".</blockquote><br />That was probably me over on ADM in the mid-90s.&nbsp; Soaking substrates has been done since the ancient Chinese soaked shiitake logs in water over 1000 years ago.&nbsp; This community seems to be a bit behind the times, or at least back then it was.<br />RR","title":"Re: Hydro Fruit Chamber??????"}}
