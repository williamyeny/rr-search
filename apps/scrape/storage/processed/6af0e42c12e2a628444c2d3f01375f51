Simply lay the pin on top of the agar and wait for the mycelium to grow, and then grab a tiny piece of the leading edge and transfer to a new dish.&nbsp; Since pins are growing so fast, they outrun the competition and allow you to grab a clean culture after a few days.<br /><br />250ml of agar isn't going to be enough for 20 dishes.&nbsp; You'll need twice that to get the film thick enough to support growth without drying out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Using a small pin on a petri dish?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
