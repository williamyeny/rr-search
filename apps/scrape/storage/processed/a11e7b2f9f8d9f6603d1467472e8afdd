You rarely see the old hands using any sort of 'positve pressure' box.  A glove box need not be sterile or have sterile air.  There is absolutely no way that a dust mask or even a vacuum cleaner hepa filter on a sterlite container with a computer fan is going to deliver better performance than a simple container with two holes cut for your arms, but otherwise closed up.<br /><br />What you want in a glove box is to have zero air movement.  You can lightly mist the inside air of the box with plain water, and this will attract whatever contaminants are floating around in the box to the water droplets, where they will fall by gravity to the bottom of your glovebox.  After that, simply do your work wearing latex gloves.  I use tyvek sleeves on my wrists, pulled down over the surgical gloves.  Wash the gloves with alcohol before working.  I have nothing at all attached to the glovebox.  Just two 4\" holes for my arms to stick through.  The loose fitting sleeves seal around the holes well enough, and allows me to pull my hands in and out with ease to use my alcohol torch. (I don't like to use the flame inside the box due to excessive heat)  My success rate with the glovebox described above is equal to that of my laminar flow hood.  I prefer the flowhood because it's easier to work in front of and you have more room to move around.<br /><br />The problem with having a fan on your glovebox is it will cause turbulence inside the box, which will keep any contaminants in suspension where they are actually more likely to land on your project than without a fan.  Best of luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: working on a glove box... some questions"}}
