It's an inert volcanic material produced at exteremely high temperatures and is already sterile when manufactured.  For use in pf cakes, it gets sterilzed again along with the substrate.  For dunk and roll, you can bake it in the oven at 350 for half an hour, but I've used it many times right out of the bag without problems.
