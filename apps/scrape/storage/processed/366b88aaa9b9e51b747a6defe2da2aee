If they're drying out, chances are, your gas exchange holes are too big.  You don't want more than four 1/8\" (3mm) holes.  You could even get by with smaller holes.  I use four 3/32\" (2.4mm) holes for both 1/2 pint pf cakes and full quart grain jars.  Larger holes can dry out the material and encourage invitro pinning.<br /><br />Bear in mind, a substrate on the dry side will colonize faster than an overly wet one, so if your jars didn't colonize, something else might be wrong.<br /><br />It's also a good idea in a dry climate to run a humidifier in the room your grow is located to raise the ambient humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re: dry climate..."}}
