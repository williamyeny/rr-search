Filter patch bags generally hold more product than jars, therefore there is more internal heat produced as the grain colonizes.  Don't go over 80F during colonization of grains.  <br /><br />Also, light has zero effect on colonizing spawn(agar, rye, millet, wbs, etc), good or bad.  I've placed colonizing petri dishes and grains on an open shelf at normal room temperature with normal indoor light exposure for many years.  Once the grain is spawned to manure or cased, it's a good idea to cover with foil to restrict air exchange while allowing gas exchange, as well as to block light during the time the substrate/casing is colonizing.  This allows the introduction of light to the <i>fully colonized</i> substrate to act as one of the pinning triggers.  Just remember, light is one of the pinning triggers, but it's horribly overrated by many growers who misunderstand that it's not the only one.  You still need a fully colonized substrate, an increase in fresh air, which results in a rapid decrease in CO2 levels, evaporation from the substrate or casing layer, <i>and</i> light.<br /><br />If one wishes to grow invitro on grains in a bag, it helps to mix moistened vermiculite in with the grains prior to sterilization. This is known as rez-effect.  Otherwise, I'd recommend opening the bag up and applying a casing layer to the top once it's fully colonized.  You can fruit in the bag by opening the top of the bag once or twice per day to allow fresh air exchange.  Remember, the filter patch will exchange a very small amount of gasses, but for good fruiting performance, you need actual air exchange, which the filter can't provide.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycobags","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
