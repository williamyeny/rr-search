Anybody who's ever eaten a carrot or potato, onion, etc., has eaten those because they're in the soil everywhere.<br /><br />Organic gardeners in desert climates often order trichoderma cultures to put into the soil in order to increase harvests.  It's a beneficial organism.  Gardeners also spray bacillus(BT) on plants to control caterpillars, and the fruits are safe to harvest and eat the day of spraying.<br /><br />Anyone who eats store bought mushrooms eats mushrooms that have come from moldy substrates because commercial farms make no attempt to toss out fruits from contaminated substrates, nor does the health departments in any country require them to.  Molds indoors are harmful to our substrates and mycelium, but not to the sex organs of the mycelium, unless the grower is lazy and allows cobweb or verticillium to crawl all over the fruits, which takes several days after the moldy substrate becomes visible.  Anyone who has ever eaten cheese has eaten green molds.
