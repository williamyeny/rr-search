Horse or cow works fine.  Don't lime the substrate.  Mycelium prefers a pH of around 5 to 6.  Lime the casing layer later.<br /><br />I'd suggest a drive out to the countryside or a wealthy area of your city where people have horses.  Simply knock on the door of a house where you see horses, holding a bag and shovel in your hands.  I've never been turned down when asking for manure.  They're glad to have you haul it off for your garden.  Get the dry, field aged manure that's been out in the sun and rain, not the wet stuff from the barns.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is composted peat manure alright?","forum":"Mushroom Cultivation"}}
