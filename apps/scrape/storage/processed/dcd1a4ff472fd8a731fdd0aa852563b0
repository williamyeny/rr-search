The reason is that grains require sterilization, and manure does best with pasteurization.  They also each have different moisture requirements and different gas/air exchange requirements, so mixing them uncolonized is not recommended.  Follow the advice agar gave above if you want to succeed.  Nobody wants to help you fail.<br />RR","title":"Re: requirements for h/poo to colonize with spore inoculation"}}
