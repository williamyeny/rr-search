Never set the cakes directly on perlite.  The cake gets soggy, and so do the fruits.  If your cake is too wet and not losing moisture during cropping, you'll get a crappy pinset.  Bummer.  Next time, set the cake on a jar lid or something.<br /><br />The jar pictures are too blurry and dark to see anything.  Can't help ya there.<br />RR","title":"Re: Do these look like contams?!"}}
