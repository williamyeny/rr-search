It was wild to look at.  Blue shelves, with bright orange and red jars sitting on them, and the sawdust bags supplemented with wheat bran were white hot.  I could actually tell how far along the jars and bags were colonized by the heat signature coming off them.<br /><br />Paul Stamets says he doesn't heat his incubation rooms, even in the middle of winter.  There is enough heat coming off all the substrate bags to heat the entire building.<br /><br />Another big problem with incubators is that at least twice a week we get a post to the effect of \"are my jars toast?\" because somebody's heater stuck and their incbator was over 100F while they were gone to work all day.<br /><br />There is no question that jars, especially pints and half-pints will colonize faster at 82F, then at the 75F I recommend, but is it worth the expense and risk for two to three days at most faster colonization?  I say no.<br />RR","title":"Re: very confused"}}
