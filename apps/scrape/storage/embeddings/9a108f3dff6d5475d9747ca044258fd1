humidifier will be lucky to last one.&nbsp; Perlite isn't messy, and algae will not grow on it unless you get the wrong stuff from miracle grow with chemical 'fertilizer' in it.<br />To correct something someone else said above, you should never run a fan in the room with a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>.&nbsp; Fans screw up the natural circulation in a room on which the terrarium design depends for proper operation.&nbsp; Elevate the terrarium on blocks and set it on a table or shelf in an open room, not a closet.&nbsp; A window should be at least partly cracked open for fresh air.<br />Also, to the original poster, don't get hung up on your made in china hygrometer reading.&nbsp; If you built your shotgun terrarium to specs, you can be sure your humidity and fresh air exchange are at the right level.&nbsp; Never sacrifice fresh air supply in favor of humidity. <br
