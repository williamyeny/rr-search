In addition, peroxide weakens the mushroom mycelium, slowing it way down.&nbsp; It may kill mold spores, but fruits from the wild also have live mold mycelium which recovers from the peroxide faster than the mushroom mycelium, thus you defeat the purpose.&nbsp; Don't use it.&nbsp; If you want to dip in anything, use a dilute iodine mix.&nbsp; I don't use any chemicals, but instead make a series of transfers to isolate the healthy mycelium from the molds and bacteria.<br />Cardboard is OK for outdoor grows, but you won't be able to transfer from cardboard to grains with any decent rate of success.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cloning wild fruits and beating
