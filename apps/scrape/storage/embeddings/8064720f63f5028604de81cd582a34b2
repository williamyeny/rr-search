What I get is another flush of mushrooms.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />There's no need to damage the substrate.&nbsp; Cut the mushrooms off at the base while still in the tub.&nbsp; Then, your next flush will come sooner and you'll have less chance of contamination from ripping the mycelium apart and then expecting it to re-colonize, which it will not do.&nbsp; Your next flush will be far larger than what you'll get from the primordia on the ripped out substrate that was already waiting for next flush.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />i wouldnt cut the mushrooms off the sub, i know a lot of people do this, but i dont see why you would want to leave the bottom of the mushroom on the sub.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The bottom of the mushroom is by definition 100% mycelium. The substrate is only what supports the mycelium. The 'base of the mushroom' will remain alive in the substrate and continue to function if you don't rip it out as if the mushroom were a plant and the mycelium was roots, which they are not.&nbsp; Far too many new growers don't understand this basic fact and thus spread bad info.<br />RR","title":"Re: What I do with my ripped up monotub
