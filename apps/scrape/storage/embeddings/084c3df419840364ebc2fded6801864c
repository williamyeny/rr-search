I regularly add wheat or rice bran to sawdust blocks, but they get pressure cooked. If you want an extra push, just use a higher spawn ratio.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, so that's a big part of what makes coffee so good.&nbsp; Don't lime or otherwise adjust the pH.&nbsp; I've never seen them 'add' lime to gypsum.&nbsp; Are you sure you're not just seeing 'calcium' in the ingredients?&nbsp; Gypsum is calcium sulfate.<br />RR","title":"Re: when using a
