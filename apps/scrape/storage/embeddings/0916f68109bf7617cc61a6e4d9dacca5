hard to fix what's already broken, so leave your cakes in there while you get a new tub and build it right.&nbsp; Use 1/4\" holes every two inches over all six sides.&nbsp; Place four to five inches of well drained perlite in and you'll be set.<br />Bear in mind, a 1/2\" hole has four times the area of a 1/4\" hole, and will screw up the airflow.&nbsp; You want air exchange while holding humidity.&nbsp; I experimented with nearly every drill bit I had before settling on 1/4\" holes.&nbsp; Cheap analog hygrometers from pet stores are as crappy as 'most' digital ones.&nbsp; The problem is once the electronic sensors get damp, they quit working right.&nbsp; If you can find a quality analog hygrometer with a human hair mechanism, it will be perfect.&nbsp; The chinese crap they sell now isn't worth wasting money on.&nbsp; Build the terrarium per the tek and it will work.&nbsp; <br />I don't even have a hygrometer in my underground mushroom farm.&nbsp; I've learned to 'read' the mushrooms themselves and the gravel on the floor to know when it's right.&nbsp; Once a person gains experience, the hygrometers can be taken out.&nbsp; While you're learning the ropes, you need a hygrometer that actually works though.<br />RR","title":"Re: Not enough holes?
