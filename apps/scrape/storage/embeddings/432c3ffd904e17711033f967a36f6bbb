As fungiphiles, we can really increase our knowledge and skills by expanding the species list we grow.<br /><br />Oysters grow great on straw logs, and shiitake grow well on alder sawdust which is easy to get in the PNW.  After fruiting indoors, both can be tossed into a woodpile in the back yard for a ghetto inoculation.<br /><br />Do a search online for hardwood dowels.  Get the spiral grooved ones that are made for putting furniture together.  Soak in water for three days, then PC and inoculate with grain spawn.  When the wood dowels are colonized, just drill holes in freshly cut logs and drive the dowels in with a hammer.<br /><br />Here's a few projects that can be started indoors, then moved outside later.  First is hericium, the lions mane on sawdust.  I add 20% wheat bran and ten percent gypsum to the sawdust and these get huge. Next is a local reishi, Ganoderma oregonese that I cloned from a wild mushroom this summer and it's already forming a conk indoors.  Next is three shiitake pictures grown on the same sawdust/bran/gypsum formula as the lions mane.  They get as big as portabellos if you use wheat bran and gypsum in the substrate. The pint jars have the exact same substrate, but in jars that were grown in a terrarium with perlite humidification.  With timely birthing and cold shock, shiitake fruits even before the blocks turn brown, usually within 30 days of spawning. Last is a straw log of oysters using my straw log tek from several years ago.  The bowl of oysters is 1/2 the harvest from that log.  The other half were picked early to give the rest room to grow.  Good luck and I'd love to see more folks getting into edibles.<br />RR<br /><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-43/189642630-Hericium_on_Sawdust.jpg\" class=\"highslide\"
