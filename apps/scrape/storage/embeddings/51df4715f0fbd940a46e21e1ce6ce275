(More on that gizmodery some other time) <br /><br />The fan kicking out is a concern but the humidifier provides fresh air also, with or without a fogger, air comes in through a fishtank pump (that's what the blue tubing connects to btw) arguably in my next version I could justify getting rid of the fan all together...<br /><br />I look forward to a time when I'll have a job that has me home every day so that I can just set up a tub with polyfill and call it a day.&nbsp;  Until then, this has been working nicely with my schedule! <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\"

everything just fine with no fire hazard and nothing to break down.&nbsp; I hold degrees in both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, and what did I design?&nbsp; The <a
