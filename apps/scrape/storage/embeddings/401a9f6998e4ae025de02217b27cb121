said:</strong><br /><b>Now keep in mind this is probably incorrect, but this is what I understand:</b><br />The light is to trigger pinning,&nbsp; when the mycellium sees the light it thinks it has colonized all the way and is now at the top.&nbsp; It wants to produce mushrooms in the air not in the ground.&nbsp; If the mycellium sees no light it thinks it is still under the ground and not ready to fruit.<br />The light also gives the mushroom a direction to grow ( up ).<br />If this is true it would seem to me the type of light would not matter as long as it is not too hot and dry out the substrate.</blockquote><br />That's right.&nbsp; Your entire post is totally incorrect.&nbsp; Light has nothing to do with 'telling the mycelium its reached the surface', nor do mushrooms need light to tell them which way is up.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown in total darkness grow straight up, away from <b>gravity</b>, which tells them which way to grow.&nbsp; Mushrooms orient towards the light because they're using it as a source of energy.<br /><a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek#lighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Lighting requirements of
