This is a very common problem when running cool mists 24/7 because the air can't absorb all the moisture you're pumping into the greenhouse.  If your casing layer becomes waterlogged, it won't pin.<br />Ideally, you would mist your casing layer until it 'glistens', then allow it to dry out a tad before misting again a few hours later.  This steady rate of evaporation of moisture from the casing is a major pinning trigger.<br />I used a coolmist as you are for a year or two before settling on the way I now do it, with the coolmist sitting directly on a shelf inside the greenhouse.  You'll need to connect it to a humidistat or timer to keep it from saturating everything inside.  <br />Right now, I'm fruiting Reishi from uncased substrate blocks so I need a very high humidity.  I'm running my coolmist 30 seconds on, three minutes off.  This provides 90 to 95 percent humidity with no water droplets forming whatsoever.<br />When fruiting cased substrates, I run it one minute on, six minutes off.  Of course, these figures are based on my unique setup, so you'll have to experiment to find the sweet spot in your operation.  <br />I have several large slits, and even a few holes cut in the plastic for air exchange.  In fact, the door is simply a large sheet of plastic sheeting hanging from the top, with a weight on the bottom to hold it down.  The full length of both sides is not connected, so two large slits run from the ceiling to the floor of the greenhouse.  The more air exchange you can give the better, as long as you can maintain humidity.  That is the reason I moved the coolmist into the inside, rather than on the outside.<br />The unexpected side-benefit to this system is my cheapo vics humidifier is now a year and a half old, and hasn't failed yet.  When I was connecting hoses from the coolmist to the greenhouse, they would fail almost like clockwork at ninety days.  I suspect it's the slight amount of static pressure that develops when using hoses, which forces moisture into the motor bushings.  They would always get noisy, then fail, and you can't return them to the store for credit because they've been modified.  The timer I now use is the repeat cycle timer near the bottom of this page. <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml</a><br />I also have the humidistat they sell on that same page, but if you order it, be very careful to always harvest before a major spore drop occurs, because the spores will jam up the mechanism, causing the humidistat to fail.  The cycle timer mounts outside the greenhouse so it's safe.  Also, the humidistat won't provide over 80%, which is fine for cased substrates as long as you put a sheet of wax paper over the casing layer during pinning initiation.<br />RR","title":"Re: Martha RH
