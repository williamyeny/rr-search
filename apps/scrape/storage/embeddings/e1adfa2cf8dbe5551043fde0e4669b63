an 'idea' to back up your claim.<br />Cubensis is a primary, not secondary decomposer.&nbsp; Oyster mushrooms for example can be both.&nbsp; You can grow Shiitake on sawdust blocks, and then re-sterilize the blocks and inoculate with oyster mycelium for a second round.&nbsp; You can't however use them to grow Shiitake again, nor could you grow Shiitake on spent oyster mushroom blocks.<br />The point is don't argue that which you know nothing about, and don't call people dumbass for not supporting your theory, which is not sound to begin with.<br />Experiment, and then post the results.&nbsp; That's how it works.<br />RR","title":"Re: Special usage of \"empty\"
