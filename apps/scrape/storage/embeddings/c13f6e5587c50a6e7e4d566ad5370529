In fact, I probably beat up your daddy or grandpa when I was in high school. You follow me around just to troll my posts, and then say the opposite no matter what, and I'm sick and fucking tired of it.  I've asked you privately to wait until you've grown your first mushroom crop before passing out your bad advice, but you simply don't listen.  <br />Just two weeks ago, you didn't even know what mushroom mycelium was, telling a guy with an obviously contaminated jar that it was fine, for no other reason than you saw that I had posted and told him that a jar that colonizes fully from spores in two days is colonized with mold.  Even after he posted pictures of the jar, <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/5866649#Post5866649\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/5866649#Post5866649</a> you told him it was ok, because you have no idea what a jar of mushroom mycelium looks like.<br />To even suggest using tin foil to prevent contamination proves you're an absolute moron.  Perhaps in a multi-million dollar sterile lab, such will work, but nobody here has a sterile lab.  We have kitchens with moldy fruit and bedrooms with carpet, curtains, bedding, dogs and cats, etc.<br />I'm trying to help people here out of a love for the art, and you're nothing but a post whoring kid trying to make a name for yourself at the expense of others with your keyboard.<br />The problem with idiots like you is the new folks who are trying to learn the hobby take bad advice and then ruin their projects with it and lose their hard earned money all for nothing.   <br />You need to sit back, study for a while, then attempt to grow a crop yourself before telling others how to do it.  A high school biology class doesn't make you a mycologist.  The advice I gave on agar preparation is straight from 20+ years of experience doing isolations of hundreds of species and from my work with internationally known mycologists, from whom I've learned the ropes.  I will never teach the easiest, lazy-ass way of doing anything.  I will explain what I know works, and will only post teks that I have used and proved for years.<br />Now, go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, and stay off my back.<br />I sincerely apologize to anyone offended by the above.  I've tried using the nice approach.  I've tried gently pm'ing the guy to ask him to stop trolling.  Other growers have tried both nicely and not so nice to get the guy to grow up and act like an adult. He even spouted off to a moderator earlier that tried to prod him in the right direction. He simply refuses to act like an adult.  I'm over it with the idiot.<br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation from Syringe: check my
