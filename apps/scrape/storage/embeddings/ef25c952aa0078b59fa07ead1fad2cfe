Not \"lots.\"<br />Anything above 92-95% will cause problems. 100% humidity is absurdly high for fruiting. Mycelium grows in a moisture saturated environment when it is colonizing, it knows to fruit by two main triggers: exposure to light, and lower humidity - which means it has broken the surface of the substrate and its time to fruit.<br />High humidity causes the mycelium to continue colonizing and consuming everything it finds, including its own fruits.<br />I suggest reading The Mushroom Cultivator by Stamets for some good background info on the life cycle of mushrooms. It covers humidity levels very well.</blockquote><br />Incorrect, and TMC is chock full of outdated and incorrect information, most of which was corrected in GGMM.&nbsp; TMC says to 'incubate at 86F, which is ten degrees too hot.&nbsp; It says to incubate in total darkness, which delays pinning.&nbsp; It gives the incorrect humidity as you stated above, and many other things that we now know more about than back in 1985.<br />You want near saturation humidity and massive air exchange.&nbsp; A drop in humidity is not a pinning trigger, and light is a secondary pinning trigger.&nbsp; A loss of moisture from the substrate is the number one pinning trigger, and you can get a loss of moisture even at 99% humidity if your rate of air exchange is high enough.<br />The mycelium growth over the caps is an indicator of stale, still air.&nbsp; I think you're saying roughly the same thing, just in a different way.&nbsp; If he'll increase fresh air exchange, the problem will rectify itself, even if he keeps a high humidity, which uncased substrate requires.&nbsp; Primordia form in saturation humidity, so an uncased substrate requires near 100% humidity.&nbsp; A cased substrate tends to hold a higher humidity right at the surface, thus it's more forgiving of improper attention to humidity control.&nbsp; At any rate, fresh, moving, and turbulent air is what leads to the number ONE pinning trigger, which is evaporation of moisture from the substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's up with these strange looking
