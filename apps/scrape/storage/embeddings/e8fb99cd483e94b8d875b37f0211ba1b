The mushies are made up of and grow on the mycelium network. That network carries nutes to the mushies, it also carries the contam to the mushies. So if there is mold on your casing, it is also in the mushi.\"<br /><br />My friend, that is totally false and goes against everything we've learned about how mycelium works. Mushrooms are not like plants where the mycelium is the root.  It simply doesn't work that way. The mycelium metabolizes the food it 'eats'. When you go to paul stamets seminars he covers this myth in depth.  He has used mycelium to clean up diesel oil spills and other toxic waste dumps and the mushrooms are completely edible and free of all toxins from the soil as established by rigorous testing with gas chromatography.<br /><br />For those of you who are afraid of moldy cakes, be sure to never eat cheese, because cheese can not be made without mold.  Very thick layers of mold are cut off the blocks of cheese to give them eye-appeal for the market.  The cheese is safe, believe me. You've all eaten cheese all your lives.<br /><br />Now, that being said, I immediately throw away any contaminated substrate as soon as I see it.  The danger is in polluting my growing environment with the released spores that will contaminate future projects.  However, any mushrooms on the substrate are 100% safe to eat.  That is a fact.  We seriously need less disinformation and fear mongering.  If anyone can produce evidence from one of the established university mycological programs such as Penn State, or anything Stamets has written on the subject I will gladly eat my words.  I have done serious research into this.  Green molds are common in commercial mushroom operations, so if you eat store bought edible mushrooms, you are very often eating mushrooms from substrates with molds. There is not mold in the fruitbody.  They are 100% safe.<br />RR","title":"Re: Safe to eat mushrooms off of a cake with green
