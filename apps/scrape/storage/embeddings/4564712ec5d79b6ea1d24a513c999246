This means they're already releasing their carbon into the air as CO2, thus there is a zero carbon footprint from burning it for heat.<br /><br />People in other places will need to do what is appropriate for their area, but using 'conventional' heat transfers money from working people to the super-rich and terrorist organizations who own and manage the so-called 'energy supply'.<br />RR<br
