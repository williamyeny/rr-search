It's the same principle of leaving a tray too dry and then noticing the fruits only form around the edges.<br /><br />Try this again while maintaining conditions on all trays via proper misting and you'll see even performance on all.&nbsp; What it does tell us is what we've known for a long time; that a casing layer allows one to grow mushrooms with less maintenance. This is beneficial for those who need to be gone for a day or three at a time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cased vs uncased Psilocybe
