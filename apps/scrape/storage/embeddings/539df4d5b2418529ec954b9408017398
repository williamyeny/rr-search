I'm wondering if it's too late for me to dunk anymore. My thought is that if I do choose to dunk the cake will get waterlogged.</blockquote><br />If your cakes are dry then dunk for a few hours and then see how it goes.&nbsp; You can tell by the weight if the moisture level is too much or too dry.<br />The saucer of water is another excellent method, but as with dunking you don't want to allow it to get waterlogged, which it will if left too long.<br />There's bad advice above because many new growers still don't understand the relationship between humidity, fresh air exchange, misting, and substrate moisture content, all of which need to be balanced to get good performance.<br />It's easy to get 100% humidity-simply put the cake in a large jar and close the lid.&nbsp; You'll get saturation humidity, but no mushrooms.&nbsp; In order for pins to form properly, a substrate MUST be losing moisture to evaporation.&nbsp; This requires a constant fresh air supply.&nbsp; Even at 99% humidity, if you're getting sufficient fresh air, the cake will lose moisture and pins will form.&nbsp; Now, you must mist daily to replenish that moisture or the cake will dry out.&nbsp; A cake that gets very dry will often mold after it gets re-hydrated because allowing it to dry totally out stunted the mycelium on the surface, allowing mold spores to germinate and grow.<br />The desired balance is proper humidity, proper air exchange, proper substrate moisture content; which means allowing it to lose some moisture, and then replacing it.&nbsp; A <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> will do all of the above but the misting and dunking/saucer tek, and for that you need a pair of eyeballs-it can't be automated.<br />Your cake was damaged by drilling for that silly straw thing.&nbsp; That is another of the bogus teks that need to be deposited on the trash heap of the past and I've done my part every time it comes up.&nbsp; Your cake won't fruit until the mycelium heals from the damage.","title":"Re: Will dunking a cake under these curcumstances ruin
