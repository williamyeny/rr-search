cup)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Always keep your measurements in the same units.&nbsp; If you want to use cups, then use cups or parts thereof for everything.(quarts, pints, cups, tablespoons, teaspoons) Don't mix cups with ml.&nbsp; If you want to use metric measurements, then it makes everything easier to use the 'parts' measurements I gave you earlier.<br /><br />In the link I gave you, I said to use one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat and you'll get close enough.&nbsp; That's about 2%. <br /><br />Note that if you're using a bulk substrate and growing cubensis, a casing is of little benefit anyway.<br />RR","title":"Re: newb question about
