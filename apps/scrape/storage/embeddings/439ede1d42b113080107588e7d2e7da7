That figure comes from an error in paul stamets TMC, which was corrected in later books.  However, many growers only have TMC, thus refer to it as <i>the bible</i>, as if everything we've learned about mushroom growing since 1985 when artificial cultivation at home was in its infancy, is void.<br />Cubensis is a TROPICAL species that fruits in Texas and Florida in the friggen summer months for crying out loud.  What's this crap about a temperature drop being required??  People really need to think these things through rather than blindly following.  Temperature drops are required for cold weather, fall fruiting mushrooms, not tropical summer fruiting species.  Why does this crap keep getting repeated ad nauseam?  It defies common sense.<br />RR","title":"Re: Temperature
