'mated', forming dikaryotic mycelium.<br />Cloning a store-bought shiitake is going to be hit or miss, mainly miss.&nbsp; I'm a small shiitake farmer, but I still do four to five grain to grain transfers using 5 pounds of rye berries in each spawn bag, so my mycelium is really grown out by the time it fruits.&nbsp; I'd hate to start that process over at square one again.&nbsp; If you're seriously into growing edibles, you should pony up the bux and get a good culture.&nbsp; They're $225 each at aloha medicinals, but you'll get young cell lines with aggressive growth, and proved fruiting performance. <br />RR","title":"Re: Shiitake
