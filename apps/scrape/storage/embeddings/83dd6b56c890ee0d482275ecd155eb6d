species is very important.&nbsp; If we're growing E coli, we'd use a warmer temperature near our own body temp in order to favor the organism we want to grow.&nbsp; If we wanted to grow thermophilic bacteria, we'd run around 90F to 100F.<br /><br />Most mushroom mycelium will grow fastest at around 80F.&nbsp; However, that can also stimulate competitor organisms.&nbsp; It's not just about sterilization because the material we use for filters is rarely 100% effective, especially those crappy postage stamp filters on spawn bags.&nbsp; We need to assume that contaminants will get into our media at some point and adjust temperature and other parameters to compensate.<br /><br />For example, my Shiitake blocks spend three to four months in the bag before stripping the bags off to fruit.&nbsp; To compensate, I keep my colonization area at 60F to 65F, which means slightly slower colonization times, but substantially lower contamination rates during that three to four months.<br /><br />For cubes, a temperature of 75F to 80F gives the best performance since even on a petri dish there is no increase in lateral colonization speed above 81F, and it begins to decline in speed at 83F.&nbsp; Temps above this amount stimulate molds while throttling back the cubensis.<br />RR","title":"Re: Making grain masters from agar
