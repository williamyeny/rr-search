is in there every few hours misting and fanning.<br /><br />She is using a stray bottle to spray distilled water.&nbsp; Our water has chlorine in it so that is why we arent using tap water.&nbsp; She sprays the walls of the tub and the perlite while trying to avoid direct spraying on the cakes.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Bad news.&nbsp; If you're going to use the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>, you should follow the teks properly.&nbsp; You're supposed to mist the cakes.&nbsp; The plastic terrarium has no need for water, so misting the sides is an exercise in futility.<br /><br />Mist the cakes, and then let them dry out for a few hours before misting again.&nbsp; By 'dry out' I mean the visible moisture on the surface has evaporated.&nbsp; The mycelium on the caps indicates you're not letting them dry out enough between misting.<br /><br />Never use distilled water except in a humidifier.&nbsp; Don't make cakes with it, don't water with it and don't mist with it.&nbsp; The amount of chlorine in tap water will not harm the cakes.&nbsp; In fact, I've dunked substrates in a ten percent bleach solution before, so rest assured tap water is fine.<br /><br />The reason they're different colors is because they're different strains.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>mavruss said:</b><br />Yes, we are using a SGFC.&nbsp; We closed some of the holes because we couldnt keep the humidity between 95-99% humidity.&nbsp; More like 80-85%&nbsp; We live in dry/cold climate.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Never tape the holes.&nbsp; You're restricting free air movement, which lowers humidity as has been proved with dozens of side-by-side tests.&nbsp; Place 1/4\" holes 2\" apart on all six sides and make sure you have the terrarium elevated off the table it's on so air can enter the bottom.<br />RR","title":"Re: A first time post, a first time grow, and one
