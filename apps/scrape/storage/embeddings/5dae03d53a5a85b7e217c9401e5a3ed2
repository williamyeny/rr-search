results.<br /><br />You will not fruit 30 jars in a 56 quart terrarium.<br /><br />We've known for years that digital hygrometers will not withstand the high humidity of a terrarium.&nbsp; You need an analog hygrometer.<br /><br />A fish aquarium pump will not provide sufficient fresh air exchange, nor is it desired or necessary to filter air entering a terrarium.<br /><br />Incandescent lamps are the wrong color temperature for mushroom growing.<br /><br />2 gallons isn't enough Perlite for a 56 quart terrarium.&nbsp; You want the perlite 4\" to 5\" in thickness.<br /><br />If you ever see the word 'hydroponic' used for any reason in relation to mushroom growing, run away as fast as you can.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mega Mushroom Growing and Incubator
