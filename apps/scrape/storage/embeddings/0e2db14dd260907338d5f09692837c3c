It's an awesome substrate material, right up there with horse manure in fact.  It is not however, suited as a casing material unless it's cut by way more than half with verm.  The same results could be obtained by 'casing' with horse manure mixed with verm. The fact is, once your coir 'casing' gets fully colonized, it is no longer a casing layer, but a second layer of substrate.  However, cubes are so darned easy to grow, they grow on almost anything and don't require a casing layer.  That's why a good strain will fruit from a coir substrate, but the fruits will be larger if there's a way to add moisture to the casing layer, which becomes difficult if it's fuly colonized.<br />I find it most disingenuous that you call 'bullshit' to those who disagree, while cherry picking a couple of pictures of success out of the hundreds of pictures of failures and fully colonized, non-pinning coir casings we see folks asking for help with here and on the other sites every day, including your own. Such does not prove coir is superior.  The experienced growers who try their best to steer the new folks in the right direction have reached their conclusions after years of research and experimentation. If coir is such a great casing material, let's see a few successful coir 'casings' on Agaricus, shaggy manes, enoki or pan cyans.  <br />RR","title":"Re: coir versus vermiculite
