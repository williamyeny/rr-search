relevant to your question because it proves you're using the search engine here as you should. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/> <br /><br />No tub is air tight unless you tape the lid in place, which is not recommended.&nbsp; It's not the light causing premature pinning.&nbsp; Light is a secondary pinning trigger, but mycelium uses it as an energy source from day one.<br /><br />Avoid bright, direct light, especially sunlight during colonization, but normal ambient room light is good, and will actually speed up colonization.<br /><br />Whether your mycelium fruits in one giant flush, or in a few mushrooms at a time continuously(or only around the edges for example) is much more strain related than how you juggle fruiting parameters.&nbsp; Obviously you can aid or screw up a good flush by failing to follow good pinning strategy, but keeping colonizing substrates in the dark is outdated info based on TMC, which was absolutely the best guide around at the time, and still has lots wonderful information in it.<br /><br />If you want massive single flushes, isolate or clone a strain which will deliver that.&nbsp; There's a lot to be said in favor of 'one flush wonders' because you get all your product at once and then discard the substrate outdoors before green molds naturally set in.<br />RR","title":"Re: light confusion with bulk
