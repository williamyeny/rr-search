In fact, I don't think I've ever picked an oyster mushroom from a log in the forest that didn't also have trichoderma growing on it.  That's how common trich is.  In fact, trichoderma inhabits nearly every cubic inch of soil on earth except extreme deserts and the arctic.<br />On page one of Paul Stamets 'Mycelium Running', he starts with this sentence: <i>\"There are more species of fungi, bacteria, and protozoa in a single scoop of soil than there are plants and vertebrate animals in all of North America\".</i>  However, we can pick wild boletes, chaneterelles, agaricus, matsutake, etc., etc., from this mold infested soil, and eat them without getting sick. We can pick Cubensis from a nasty pile of maggot infested cow shit and eat it without getting sick.<br />If you put blue cheese salad dressing on your salad, you're eating huge chunks of the penicillium mold, because it's floating in the dressing.<br />It never ceases to amaze me the fear that gets spread on these boards over harmless molds.  If your fruits were covered with yellow or brown molds, I'd say toss them, as you would any moldy fruit or other food.  Likewise if they were wet and became rotten from bacteria, because bacteria can cause food poisoning.  <br />However, as I've said for many years, just because there's a spot of mold on a cake, does not mean the fruits growing from that cake are contaminated.  Mushrooms do not have vascular systems like plants, and do not suck up contaminant molds or bacteria from the substrate.<br />If the fruit is fine and healthy, munch away.  And, for those of you who don't know, please stop spreading myths and fear.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can you eat the mushrooms that grow from a cake that becomes
