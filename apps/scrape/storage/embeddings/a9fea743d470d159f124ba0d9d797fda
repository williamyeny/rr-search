/>There's a difference between 'legal' and 'smart'.<br /><br />Remember, magic mushrooms are still just mushrooms, and in the final analysis pot is little more than a commercial farm commodity, something humans have been producing since the dawn of civilization.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've always found pot growing books to be poorly written, even worse edited, and mostly dumb hype.&nbsp; Ditto for 'magic mushroom' books.&nbsp; If one is a master gardener, he can grow pot well because he understands how plants function and grow.&nbsp; If one is a master mushroom grower and desires to cultivate mushrooms of a particular species, he can do that because he understands what mycelium needs to grow and fruit.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, a book about nothing but cubes would indicate a lack of experience on the part of the author, just as a pot book shouldn't be taken as a scholarly horticultural text.<br />RR","title":"Re: Legality of a shroom
