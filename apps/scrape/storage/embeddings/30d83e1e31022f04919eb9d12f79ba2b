been experimenting with using less gypsum to find the cut-off point where the benefits start to fall off, mainly to control costs since in our Shiitake farm we're buying gypsum by the 1,000 pound pallet, which gets expensive in our location.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've found any less than 3% by weight and our yield starts to fall off.&nbsp; 3% by weight is about 1% to 2% by volume due to gypsum being considerably heavier than most dry substrate materials.<br /><br />Using a bit too much gypsum doesn't hurt at all because the fungi will only consume what it needs.&nbsp; I used to recommend up to 10% gypsum by volume, but I have now discovered that using quite a bit less than that will still give the same results in substrates.&nbsp; If you're making casing layers, 10% is great because it keeps the casing nice and loose.<br />RR","title":"Re: Did I add enough
