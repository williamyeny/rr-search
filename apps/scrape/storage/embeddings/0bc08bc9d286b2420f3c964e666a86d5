This is contrary to my knowledge of that kingdom. A study showing what he is claiming would be a very big deal to the field.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Gosh, this is old news. Try reading the first chapter of the mushroom growers handbook.&nbsp; I've posted the link many times.&nbsp; In addition, I've observed hundreds of thousands of mushroom grows over the years, and I know for a fact that they grow up to three times the size by providing proper lighting.&nbsp; Hopefully nobody thinks I like spending lots of money on electricity for my commercial mushroom farm for nothing.&nbsp; I do it for massively increased yields.<br /><br />Think about that.&nbsp; Three times the size and weight, which means three times the calories when we eat them.&nbsp; Calories are a unit of energy.&nbsp; Provide light to the mushrooms, and the mushrooms produce energy.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Nalim said:</b><br />Mycelium derives no energy from light. All energy production comes from breakdown of organic compounds.<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Nalim said:</b><br />I have a masters degree in biology with a&nbsp; large chunk of that aimed at microbiology.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The first thing you should have learned as a freshman is to avoid making blanket negative statements such as 'Mycelium derives no energy from light', which can not be proved.&nbsp; It is as wrong as saying 'gravity has no bearing on mushroom growth'.<br /><br />We know some mushrooms are phototropic and will orient towards light.&nbsp; This is a reaction to light.&nbsp; Growing twice as large and producing twice or more the weight is not a reaction.&nbsp; The mushroom has derived energy by or from the light in some way.&nbsp; I have observed this countless times over the years, and duplicate the 'experiment' daily.&nbsp; It's how I make my living.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need Professional Help and Tips
