I have, and have found absolutely no correlation with potency to substrate.  A fact of cubes is their inherent inconsistency in potency.  It even varies from flush to flush, and from mushroom to mushroom on a single flush, even with an isolated strain.  I've had extremely potent mushrooms from every substrate, and I've had weak mushrooms from every single substrate.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />I'm not spreading misinformation, Cubes are a dung loving mushroom. They do the BEST on their native food source.</blockquote><br />Which is not horse manure by the way, although they do well on it.  <br />I'm sure this will still be getting argued about when we're all sitting in our wheelchairs shitting our pants, which actually proves my point.  If you could grow them on ONE substrate that would produce extremely potent mushrooms EVERY time, the question would have been settled years ago.  However, such is not the case and never has been, so people still waste time arguing about it, instead of doing what does work, such as isolating better strains or growing more potent species, or just eating more.<br />RR","title":"Re: how to get bigger mushrooms?w/
