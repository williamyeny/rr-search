more than one doctor.&nbsp; However, it doesn't take a degree to be a mycologist.&nbsp; A mycologist is one who practices mycology.<br />As long as we buy our jars in quart size and have measuring <i>cups</i> in our kitchen cabinets, that's the system we're stuck with in the US.&nbsp; I have no doubt we'll make the switch someday, but we Americans are so damned afraid of making changes for some silly reason, even when shown something else works better.&nbsp; Look at all the ruckus the rednecks are stirring up over health care overhaul as a prime example.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why don't we
