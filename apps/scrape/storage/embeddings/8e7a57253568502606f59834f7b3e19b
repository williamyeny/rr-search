Temp, O2, and Light are the seasonal triggers for Mushies to stop the Veg state, and enter the fruiting phase, I don't think it matters if they are tropical, or not. Cold shocking just seems logical to initiate the Fruiting cycle, don't think it really has mush to do with Bacteria, as they would most likely survive the dunk &amp; shock with no problems..</blockquote><br />Sorry friend, but cubensis fruits all season. It does not wait for cold weather. Folks in Texas and Florida are picking them now.  This is spring, not fall.  The purpose for dunking in the refrigerator is as stated, to keep bacteria under control during the dunk.  The bacteria survive the dunk, but they don't double their colony size every two hours, because the refrigerator protects the cake, just as it protects your food from rotting due to bacteria.<br />Cubensis fruits very well in the 70F-80F degree range.  I colonize all jars at room temperature, then keep at room temperature for the flushing cycle. There is no reduction of temperature at any time in any of my grows(edibles excluded)prior to first flush.  I do dunk casings in the refrigerator after first flush, but as stated above, this is not cold shocking.  I hope this has helped to clear up some of the misunderstanding.<br />RR","title":"Re: COOLER
