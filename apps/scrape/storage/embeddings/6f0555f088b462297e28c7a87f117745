Pressure goes UP one psi for every 10 degrees farenhiet. Put a ballon in the freezer and watch it deflate. Cold air is more dense and therefor has LOWER pressure. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Don't confuse what happens in an enclosed vessel with what happens in free air, such as a shotgun terrarium full of holes.&nbsp; The highest pressure on the planet occurs in the arctic areas during winter, and the lowest pressure occurs in the tropics during summer.&nbsp; You're arguing physics without a basic understanding of processes involved.&nbsp; Sorry to be harsh.&nbsp; Keep reading and studying though.&nbsp; It's how we all learn.&nbsp; Air expands when heated.&nbsp; That means the molecules are farther apart, resulting in <i>lower pressure</i>.&nbsp; We can artificially create pressure by heating air in a vessel such as a hot air balloon, but that doesn't simulate what happens in free air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dry conditions--Miracle Gro perlite the
