is defined as a temp between 69F ad 77F.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>fee said:</strong><br />and as far as bacteria is concerned I wouldnt be worrying about the temp producing it I would be worrying about my sterile techniques </blockquote><br />True, but expect at least some bacteria to make it into every substrate, regardless of how careful you are.&nbsp; The important thing is to encourage the mushroom mycelium and not the bacteria.&nbsp; If you stimulate each equally, the bacteria will win nearly every time.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>fee said:</strong><br />I mean for fucks sake when your doing commercial grows you dont even need to pasteurize your horse poo as it does it for you by being in large piles<br />I guess we dont need to pasteurize any more either since commercial growers dont</blockquote><br />Not so.&nbsp; Commercial farms ALWAYS pasteurize manure and/or straw, and sterilize supplemented sawdust.&nbsp; Don't confuse composting with pasteurization. <br />As for colonization temperatures of cubensis in jars, growth speeds up until an ambient of 75F, where it remains flat until 80F, and then begins to slow down.&nbsp; An ambient of 83F or higher will result in a mycelium temperature approaching 90 or more, leading to slower growth and a higher incidence of failure due to bacteria and thermophilic molds.&nbsp; Several years ago, I ran tightly controlled tests over a variety of 'strains', and repeated them three times, intending to average the results.&nbsp; However, there was little to no variance in results over these runs.&nbsp; Since that time, those same temperature ranges have been used by countless growers, and they've reported lower rates of contamination at lower temps.<br />RR","title":"Re: A word about
