The mycological definition of 'strain' has nothing to do with the name somebody who collected a wild print gave it and succeeding generations that came from that original.<br />There is no rule that says \"all B+ will colonize faster\" or that \"all penis envy will look like a penis\" or \"all cambodian will freak you out\" etc.<br />The family with ten kids will have a doctor, a bum or two, an athlete or two, a fat kid, and a couple of skinny ones. A few will be smart, and a few will be dumber than rocks. Each child by definition is a 'strain'.  Ditto for mycology.<br />As for different qualities due to the part of the world they were harvested from, all come from tropical or sub-tropical reigons and have remarkably similar environmental requirements.<br />To prove this, take a single spore print and isolate ten sectors and fruit out each one.  I guarantee that each of the ten isolates will produce distinctly different fruits with different trip qualities, and the differences will be just as great as if you took ten different prints and grew out each one from multispore inoculation.  Try it.
