title=\":grin:\"/> </blockquote><br />It's the next model up from the SZ300 pictured here. <a href=\"http://www.microscopesusa.com/SZ300.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.microscopesusa.com/SZ<wbr>300.html</a> It's in the same housing as the SZ300 but has better lenses and a plan-achromatic objective.&nbsp; I have the trinocular version with CCD tube and the flexible arm stand so I can use it over petri dishes in front of the flowhood to make very accurate cuts and transfers when doing strain isolations.<br />This is the type of microscope you want for looking down on an object.&nbsp;  A <i>light microscope</i> on the other hand, shines the light from the bottom, so you look at the light that shines <i>through</i> the object.&nbsp; A stereo zoom microscope lets you see the light that is reflected <i>back</i> from an object, so it's more like having a super macro lense on a camera.&nbsp; It takes pretty nice gill shots too.&nbsp; In the last picture of the series below, you can see the cheilocystidia lining the edge of the gills.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/190239515-P_nameko_gills_42a.jpg\"
