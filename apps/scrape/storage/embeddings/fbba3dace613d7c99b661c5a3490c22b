What I really want to know is exactly what affects the pinset. From what I have gathered it would be the growth parameters(ie, CO2, RH etc...) but I would like to hear it here in person so I can ask questions. Thanks for any help,&nbsp; MM<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The first thing is full colonization, plus a week or more for the mycelium to 'consolidate' its hold on the substrate, thereby digesting some of the food it has colonized.<br /><br />The second is massive amounts of fresh air exchange.&nbsp; Three air exchanges per hour are not nearly enough unless you only have one cake in a large terrarium.&nbsp; In fact, the whole concept of <i>air exchanges per hour</i> is a horrible way to measure fresh air supply because it doesn't take into account the amount of mycelium, thus the amount of CO2 being produced.&nbsp; Constant fresh air supply is far better, and it must be enough to keep the CO2 level at less than 1000 ppm.&nbsp; I personally shoot for under 700 ppm in my grow rooms.<br /><br />The third most important pinning trigger is light.&nbsp; That means bright, high frequency light and lots of it. Remember that the intensity of light decreases by the square of the distance from the source, so have your lamp as close to the mushroom substrate as possible without overheating the area.&nbsp; Use 6500 Kelvin lamps, as that frequency has shown to be best for mushroom production.<br /><br />In addition, clear tubs have little or nothing to do with side pinning.&nbsp; Clear tubs are better because they admit light on five sides rather than just one side(the top).&nbsp; Light anywhere on a substrate will stimulate pinning anywhere else on the substrate where conditions are ripe.&nbsp; Light doesn't just trigger pins in the area it hits, thus clear tubs are fine, and wrapping with tape makes no difference regarding side pins.&nbsp; If for some reason you don't want side pins, line the inside of the tray with plastic sheeting, which will stick to the substrate and shrink as it does, thus eliminating the gap around the edges, which is the real cause of side pinning.<br
