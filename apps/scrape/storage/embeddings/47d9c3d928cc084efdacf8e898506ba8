This was my original way of thinking. I have an LC i made from a ms syringe. The lc is 1st gen. I knocked up a qt with it (2nd gen) which I plan on using to g2g to 10 more qts wihch would be 3rd generation. Makes sense to me until I saw this old post from a TC <br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b><i>jamman said:</i></b><br />Start an LC with a syringe(1), let colonize, inject into grain jars(2). Let those colonize and transfer to more grains(3). Would the last batch of grains (3) be considered the third generation or second generation? <br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>Roadkill said:</b><br />a second generation.<br /><br />tc <br /></blockquote><br /><br />so now I am definitely confused. Can anyone explain to me why my original way of thinking is incorrect.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />They were both wrong in their use of nomenclature.&nbsp; It was simply an expansion of the first generation.&nbsp; A grain to grain transfer or an LC to LC transfer is not a generation.&nbsp; A generation is to germinate spores, grow mushrooms and take a sporeprint.&nbsp; Germinate those spores and the next generation begins.<br />RR","title":"Re: Understanding
