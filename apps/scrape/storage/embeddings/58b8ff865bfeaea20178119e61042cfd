No fancy borders are needed, just ask them to over-stitch 3 times, so it would make it stronger and stitches wont open of broke. Tell them that you want the stitched on the “fur” side to get a pocket made of “satin”, so the gypsum dust wont stick on it.<br /><br />Kasha is probably the strongest kind of lining that exist and it’s used it high quality winter coat or other of that kind. It is made of a kind of Satin on a side and on the other it’s a kind of strong fiber looking a bit as velvet.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Isn't that going to cost more than the gypsum?&nbsp; You're in a farming area.&nbsp; You should be able to get ground gypsum from the same place the wheat farmers get theirs from.&nbsp; For example, I get 1500 pounds of gypsum loaded into my pickup truck for $117, and it's already ground to the perfect texture for use.<br /><br />Call your local farm supply store or co-op and ask where the farmers buy gypsum to spread on their fields.<br
