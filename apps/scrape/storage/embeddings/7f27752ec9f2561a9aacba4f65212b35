I believe that was an anomaly in the samples sent for testing.&nbsp; After picking thousands of each, I'm firmly in the camp that says <i>P cyanescens</i> is better, both from a potency standpoint and a quality of trip standpoint.&nbsp; In fact, I quit making the annual fall run down to the mouth of the Columbia river a few years ago.<br />I have a P cyanescens isolate that I'd have to say is a 3 to 4 on the scale that places cubes at 1. The average <i>P cyanescens</i> would be at around 2.5, and the average <i>P azurescens</i> I'd give a 2. <i>Mexicana A</i> scerotia would be a 2 as well.&nbsp; I wasn't that impressed with atlantis sclerotia, but I only grew them twice, so they're not really a representative sample.&nbsp; As for subbs, I'd put them at .6 or so.<br />RR","title":"Re: Relative potency of
