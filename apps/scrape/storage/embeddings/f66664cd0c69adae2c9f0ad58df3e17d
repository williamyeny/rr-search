They're ten times thicker than tyvek, with a smaller micron size.  Mine are made from PFTE specifically for gasses and filter down to .05 micron, which is much smaller than any laminar flow hood filters out.<br /><br />They're infinitely reusable.  I have some that are ten years old and covered with rust and other stains, but still 100% effective after many hundreds of uses.<br /><br />I use the regular mason lid upside down, so the metal is in contact with the glass(for easy removal-no sticking), with the filter disk on top and the ring over that, covered with foil to prevent condensation from dripping in. You should always use a foil cover because the lid of the PC 'rains' during the entire cycle onto the jars below and can ruin your moisture content if not covered. This allows me to tighten down the lid fully tight before PC'ing so I don't have to open the PC as it cools.  I like to let it sit overnight and remove the jars when they've cooled to room temperature.<br /><br />Personally, I think paying 46 cents for a pre-cut, perfectly fitting synthetic filter disk that you'll use virtually forever is a bargain.  In fact, it would be a bargain at three times that price.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tyvek vs Filter
