something like G2G, usually two rounds would be as far as you'd want to go.&nbsp; As in, use 1 pint to make 10, use one of those to make another batch, then stop...&nbsp; So in other words, you don't

at least 100,000 quarts of rye.&nbsp; Beyond simple cell division, chronological time is very important.&nbsp; If you stretch out the G2G transfers over a period of months, the mycelium will lose
