since it's closer to the normal room temperature you'll be working with.&nbsp; Static pressure is measured in inches of water column or the metric equivalent. <br /><br />Imagine taking a piece of tubing and bending it into a U shape an filling the bottom of the U with water.&nbsp; The water would equalize in the bottom and extend the same distance up each side of the U.&nbsp; If you connected a hose from the plenum of your flowhood to one side of the tube and it pushed the water down 1\" while raising it 1\" on the other end of the tube, that would be 1\" WC static pressure.<br /><br
