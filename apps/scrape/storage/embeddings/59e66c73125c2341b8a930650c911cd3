the amount of air entering the bottom holes and passing up and out the top.&nbsp; However, you don't just want fresh air; green molds suffer and mushrooms thrive in turbulent air, thus the holes in the sides increase total fresh air movement and exchange.&nbsp; I experimented for nearly a year with that exact design before finally going with the shotgun with holes on all six sides.&nbsp; Both perform, but in my experience, consistent performance was better with the holes on all six sides.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see your results after several runs, which would tend to equalize out the variations caused by multispore inoculation.<br /><br />One viable explanation for the size discrepancy could be the increased amount of FAE and the lack of enough misting to replace the extra lost moisture in the substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun FC - Side holes may reduce
