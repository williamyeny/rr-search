Even with less holes than the tek called for.<br />Original setup was a large blue sterlite container, about 30 gallons or so, 1.5 inches of wet perlite on the bottom, a fish bowl with water/lava rocks in the middle, air pump hose w/ bubble stone running into that. Above that was a shelf rack to hold cakes/casings and a mason jar with water/lava rocks and another air pump hose w/ bubble stone running into that. 10 holes drilled all the way around the FC at rack/substrate level, also four holes drilled on the front side at perlite level to allow for better circulation. There is plenty of circulation at the lid level because of the ghetto plexiglass lid I made not sealing completely. Micropore tape on about half of the holes, as an attempt to get RH above 80%. </blockquote><br />None of which is part of the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium tek</a>.<br />Ditch the air pump, the fish bowl, and the tape over the holes. Then, drill holes on all six sides per the tek, and put four to five inches of perlite per the tek, and your humidity WILL be in the upper 90s percent.&nbsp; Don't run a fan in the room.&nbsp; The natural air currents in the room will be fine.&nbsp; A fan can disrupt the proper functioning of the terrarium, which creates its own miniature weather system by drawing air in through the bottom, and expelling it through the holes in the upper part.<br />As said, digital hygrometers are shit.&nbsp; I have one that cost over $200 and it's as crappy as the twenty dollar ones.&nbsp; Get a quality analog one at a cigar shop and calibrate it via the wet towel method.&nbsp; Take your digital hygrometer outside and smash it to bits with a rock.&nbsp; It's actually therapeutic.<br />RR","title":"Re: Low RH (help?)
