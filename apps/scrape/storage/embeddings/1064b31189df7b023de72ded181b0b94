Ive seen it addressed that a casing with a casing layer that is without its own nutrients, is no more effective at producing mushrooms than a cake.</blockquote><br />You're misusing terms due to reading posts from other noobs who also misuse terms, thus everyone gets screwed up.&nbsp; 'Casing' is not a name for a project.&nbsp; It has two meanings.&nbsp; The verb form refers to the <i>act of placing</i> a casing layer over a substrate, and the noun form refers to the <i>non-nutritious layer</i> that is placed over the substrate.<br />The whole conversation is moot because <i>P cubensis</i>, which most new members are learning to grow with, requires no casing to perform well.<br />You want air space in your terrarium for the dissipation of gasses.&nbsp; In addition, this space is needed for the fruits to grow.&nbsp; Many growers have stacked cakes and also placed them on BBQ skewers with mixed results.&nbsp; If you're interested in maximum yield, break the cakes up and spawn them to a bulk substrate such as manure or coir.<br />Once you get the hang of it and learn sterile procedure, switch to grains such as rye to spawn to manure or straw, coir, etc.<br
