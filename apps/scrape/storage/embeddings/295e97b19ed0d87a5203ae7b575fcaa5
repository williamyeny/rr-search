So sorry mustard tiger it was all in your head.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Even if two strains crossed, which they often do, it wouldn't be a hybrid.&nbsp; If a lady named Smith and a man named Jones had a baby, would you call it a hybrid?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Taken farther, if a man from Japan and a woman from Africa had a baby, would it be a hybrid?&nbsp; No, it would still be the same species, human.<br /><br />There are no sub-strains.&nbsp; A strain is a strain, period.&nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, not the name some idiot wrote on a print, the spores of which can create tens of thousands of individual strains.&nbsp; When people get a print and call it a 'strain' I go batshit, because it only serves to spread disinformation.<br /><br />This is why edibles are only sold as strains when an isolated single sector of mycelium is traded.&nbsp; If you fruit a shiitake for example and take a sporeprint, your original strain is gone once you start growing from spores again.<br />RR","title":"Re: New Strains, Straight Forward
