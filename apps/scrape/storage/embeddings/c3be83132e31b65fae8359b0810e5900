I already know you like to use lights.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Then your opinion is null and void, because that is my farm.<br /><br />I have already experimented for 40 years, so I'm not about to repeat experiments I did with lighting over the years, impacting my livelihood just to prove a point for the thousandth time.<br /><br />If what you want is a 'paper' written by some college kid instead of a mushroom farmer with four decades of experience growing mushrooms, then I suggest you seek such a thing and follow that advice.&nbsp; Every mushroom farm I know keeps their secrets very closely guarded.&nbsp; They want every competitive advantage over other farms.&nbsp; I'm the only one I know who freely shares the knowledge I've gained from actual experience.&nbsp; If you chose not to accept it, no problem.&nbsp; There's no law that says you have to. <br /><br />I wholesale my mushrooms for $6 per pound and sell to distributors for only $5 per pound, so the difference of only fifty to a hundred pounds a week means making a living or going broke.&nbsp; I don't run expensive bright lights because I think they look pretty. <br />RR","title":"Re: Light
