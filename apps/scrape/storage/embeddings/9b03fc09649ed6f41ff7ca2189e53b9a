wish to use foil to do so since it's an excellent printing medium which can be folded and mailed easily.&nbsp; I like slides, glass plates, foil and wax paper, but won't declare any to be the last word.<br />Wax paper is especially good for those making syringes because the spores don't stick to the paper.&nbsp; Just be careful though because when you pick up the print all the spores will slide off if you tilt it before folding.<br />RR","title":"Re: Whats the most professional spore print
