I think I may have even seen you quoted saying that it would be like wiping shit on your face after a shower, lol.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I've been under the impression since day 1 that flame sterilizing your needle in between jars is necessary to prevent cross contamination. Is this untrue or is the alcohol swab the only issue here?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry to bother but I've been cooling my needles with iso since I started growing, and would like to stop if it really is hurting more than helping. It just seems to me that if i shoved a red hot needle into an injector port it would melt the silicone, or at least burn up the first ML of glc coming through the needle<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
