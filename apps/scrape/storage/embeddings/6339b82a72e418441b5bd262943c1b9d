a hardware cloth at the entrance to the hive.&nbsp; The pollen is scraped off their legs and drops into a tray below where it's collected.&nbsp; Many beekeepers collect this pollen and then feed it back to the bees during the winter.&nbsp; Others sell it on the market, and then feed sugar water to the bees in the off season.&nbsp; The bees use it to feed the young and queen.&nbsp; It isn't used in honey making.&nbsp; They collect and use nectar for that.<br /><br />My point was a few years ago when bee pollen was all the rage, I tried it on several side by side tests.&nbsp; There was no increase in growth, rate of colonization, or health of the mycelium vs no pollen.&nbsp; Since that time, I've started raising bees and studying their habits and needs.&nbsp; It's universally accepted among beekeepers that harvesting the pollen for sale is hard on the colonies.&nbsp; Whether that's the main cause for collapse disorder or not is debatable.&nbsp; My wife and I live in a very remote mountain cabin in an area with no commercial agriculture, but millions of acres of wildflowers all over the mountains, and too far north and too high an elevation for the Africanized bees to survive.&nbsp; We want to do our part to try to save the bees.&nbsp; Sorry if I came across as preaching.<br />RR","title":"Re: bee pollen
