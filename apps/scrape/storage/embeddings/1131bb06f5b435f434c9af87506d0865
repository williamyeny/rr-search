oyster mushrooms, and the heat of colonization can be put to use in other ways.&nbsp; I don't heat the colonization room in my underground mushroom farm.&nbsp; In fact, I keep a window open to the outside, even when it's -20 outside, to prevent the room from overheating.<br />I think it's a great project, although I'm not clear on just what you're needing shroomjew.&nbsp; If they can set up a lab to expand the fungus, I have a test tube of the isolated oyster strain that produced the laundry basket shown on my DVD front cover.&nbsp; However, unless you help them or some other mycologist does, they'd probably lose the culture.&nbsp; How do they plan on getting this done?&nbsp; You might have her tell the instructor to contact me via the contact form on my site at <a
