Having the air saturated in no way is going to flood your cakes.  What WILL flood your cakes is pumping from a humidifier AFTER the air is already at 100%.  That's why I recommend three to five inches of well drained perlite for a terrarium, and no mechanical humidifier.  This way, if your humidity reads less than 95%, it means you need to calibrate your hygrometer.<br />Mycelium will pin best at or near saturation humidity and plenty of fresh air, whether the substrate is cased or not.  A casing layer simply helps to hold humidity high right at the surface, under less than ideal ambient conditions.  Of course, once pins form, the casing layer also helps to supply the substrate below with moisture, so you want to keep the humidity high to prevent the casing layer from drying out too much between mistings.<br />RR","title":"Re: The Myth of 100%
