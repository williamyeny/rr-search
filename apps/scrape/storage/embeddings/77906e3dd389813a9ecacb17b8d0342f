guys will quit thinking 'strain' is the name on the print, or syringe.&nbsp; Every person who finds a wild cube, takes a print and names it with a cute name, and then calls it a 'strain'.&nbsp; Exactly what makes a cube picked in one field different from a cube picked in another field besides the name some guy gave it?&nbsp; Is every kid born in one county going to grow up smarter, bigger, and with better eyesight, etc., then every kid born in a different county? <br /><br />The definition of strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, not the name on the print which has millions of spores, thus millions of possible strains.&nbsp; Strain determines potency, growth characteristics etc., within the parameters of the species.&nbsp; However, nobody can say 'such and such' a <i>named strain</i> is always a fast colonizer, more potent, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: 1st grow please review. have read forum for
