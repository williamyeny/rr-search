I would bet money they're using multispore inoculation by the looks of the pictures.&nbsp; I would also bet money they don't know how to adjust pinning triggers, by the looks of the crappy harvests they got.&nbsp; Nor do they know what a casing layer is.&nbsp; They also didn't quantify the light source or frequency used, only making high-schoolish references to dim, medium, bright, etc.<br /><br />In addition, the pictures of fruits grown in poor light conditions also show signs of insufficient fresh air exchange, which could be skewing any results obtained.&nbsp; It seems in their vigor to block light, they also blocked fresh air.&nbsp; Based on the pictures, they only had a few fruits to work with, and as everyone here has found out by experience, there can be an exponential difference in potency between individual mushrooms on the same flush.&nbsp; It takes a LOT of mushrooms to establish any sort of factual data.<br /><br />Since these results contradict the experience of thousands of members here over the last decade and earlier, I'm going to dismiss this as a fluke.&nbsp; How many times a week do we get noobs here saying things such as \"this-or-that strain are fast colonizers, slow colonizers, more potent, less potent, more contam resistant, etc\"., all based on one or two grows, when they haven't even learned the variables yet.<br /><br />Furthermore, chemistry geeks are going to have a field day with their extraction technique, which involves heating the dried fruits, completely fucking up the psilocin which is what they were trying to measure.&nbsp; They didn't even measure psilocybin, the main ingredient.<br />RR","title":"Re: Must Read!!
