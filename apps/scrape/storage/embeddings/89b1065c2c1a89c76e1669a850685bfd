In fact, on bulk substrates, cubes will fruit as well without a casing if other conditions are met.<br />I can't think of one single species of mushroom that REQUIRES a casing layer that will fruit on a sterilized one.  If you never plan to grow anything but cubes or copes, then sterilize away, or skip the trouble and don't bother with casing.<br />However, if you look at cubes as an introduction to mushroom growing, then try the techniques out that you'll need later on when you move to much less forgiving species.  If you try to fruit azures, agaricus, shaggy manes, stropharia, etc., etc., on a sterilized casing, they will sit there and refuse to pin.  The casing will turn green long before the beneficial organisms that aid in pinning can get re-established.<br />I have several trays in my grow area right now that are well over a month old, and the casing layers were not heat treated.  None have shown the slightest signs of trichoderma.  <br />If you read the chapters in stamets books on casing preparation, whether you look in TMC or GGMM written almost 10 years later, you will find no mention of sterilizing or pasteurizing casing material.  Stamets writes that the casing is \"wetted to field capacity, then applied to the fully colonized substrate\".<br />I work directly with three mushroom farms in my area, supplying them with sterile cultures and lab work.  NONE of them pasteurize or sterilize casing material.  It only seems to be in the OMC where people recommend this.  In the real world, where failure of a tray means lots of lost money, and the chance that the infection can spread to thousands of trays, they don't sterilize their casings.<br />Remember, cubes are so easy to grow, they practically grow themselves.  They don't need a casing layer, so they fruit just fine if one is prepared incorrectly, or not even used at all.  However, it's a mistake to develop bad habits that will have to be UN-learned later on.   <br />Another point to take note of is that all three mushroom farms I work with got their start because of the owner's interest in psilocybin mushrooms.  It then progressed to edibles and a very good living.  They're millionaires now.  Don't teach yourselves bad habits.<br />RR","title":"Re: Anyone not sterilize their casing
