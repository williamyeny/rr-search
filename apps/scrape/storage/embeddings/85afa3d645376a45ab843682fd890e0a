said:</strong><br />ok..but a humidifier is only about 30 bucks just seems like u would have alot more controle over the hummidity, nothing to have to rehydrate..and u dont have to replace it or keep buying bag after bag of perlite..<img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/confused.gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\":confused:\"/></blockquote><br />WTF would you need to buy more perlite for?&nbsp; It lasts a lifetime.&nbsp; When it gets dirty, you rinse, and then bake in the oven.&nbsp; It's then good as new.&nbsp; If you'll go to the hydro store, a 3 cubic foot bag of perlite which will barely fit in the trunk of a car is $18 and enough for five or six terrariums.<br />A humidifier is $30 to $50, requires a timer to regulate it, and judging from the pile of broken humidifiers in my junk pile, rarely last more than six months to a year.&nbsp; That's hardly cheaper.&nbsp; In addition, moisture that isn't absorbed immediately into the air falls on the substrate, possibly water logging it.&nbsp; Waterlogged cakes perform worse than dry cakes.&nbsp; <br />If using terrariums, stick with perlite, which is far cheaper and proven by those of us who have been doing this a very long time to be best.&nbsp; When you move up to a mini-greenhouse, you'll want to look into mechanical humidity control.<br />RR","title":"Re: why perlite
