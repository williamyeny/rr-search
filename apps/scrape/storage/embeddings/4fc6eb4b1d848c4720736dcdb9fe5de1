said:</strong><br />Its not about how many 'generations', more about how much the mycelium has traveled/spread</blockquote><br />This is correct.&nbsp; Most of you are using the word 'generation' wrong in this thread.&nbsp; A generation is going from spores to fruits and back to spores again for the next generation.<br />When it comes to grain to grain transfers, there's not a set 'number' of transfers you can do.&nbsp; Obviously, 5 grain to grain transfers with pints is a bit different than 5 grain to grain transfers with large spawn bags.&nbsp; Age of the mycelium also plays a role.&nbsp; If you let the grains sit for a week or two after colonization before G2G, you can't do as many transfers before senescence sets in.<br />When I'm rapidly expanding mycelium, I'll do 5 G2G transfers before calling it good and starting over with a fresh, low P-value culture.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many g2g's is too
