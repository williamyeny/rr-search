the mycelium is consuming.&nbsp; I know from experience that the verm is being 'eaten' by the mycelium because of how much brf cakes shrink over time.&nbsp; After six or seven flushes, they're about 1/3 original size, which means they've lost way more than the brown rice flour.&nbsp; In addition, bulk substrates with verm perform far better than without, even though other bulk substrate materials often hold as much water as verm.<br />We know mycelium can absorb the minerals in gypsum, so it only makes sense they're absorbing and using the minerals in vermiculite too.&nbsp; Another clue is that brf cakes made with sawdust instead of verm under perform cakes made with vermiculite, even when used for wood loving species such as oyster and shiitake.&nbsp; Since sawdust and verm both hold the same amount of water, it isn't the reservoir action of the verm.<br />RR","title":"Re: Aluminum Contamination of
