away from my sg fc and its fluorescent so it \"heating\" anything near my fc is not plausible</blockquote><br />Mushroom substrates produce heat which lowers the pressure by moving the air molecules farther apart, and humid air is less dense than dry air.&nbsp; The heat from a light is only one factor out of many.<br />Regardless of the air exchange physics discussion above, you'll get better fruiting performance by moving it much closer.&nbsp; The amount of light received by your mycelium decreases by the square of the distance the light moves away.&nbsp; Try to get your fluorescent fixture within 12\" or so of your fruiting chamber and pinning and fruiting performance will go significantly up.&nbsp; <br />To repeat for the 1,000th time for those who don't understand physics 101, CO2 doesn't miraculously separate from air and fall out the bottom.&nbsp; The CO2 mixes with the air and raises the total amount of CO2 in PPM of the air.&nbsp; If CO2 settled to the ground in our heavily polluted planet, we'd all be dead already from living on the surface.&nbsp; Instead, CO2 can be detected in the highest levels of the stratosphere.<br />The reason a terrarium works with holes only on the bottom is the same reason that ten years ago terrariums 'worked' with no holes, drip shields, and instructions to never mist the mushrooms and keep them in the dark while colonizing at 86F and don't worry about light when fruiting.&nbsp; However, we've progressed far beyond that prehistoric level as can be seen by the grows noobs are turning out on their very first attempt, compared to what the 'experts' were doing ten years ago.&nbsp; A Model T was great in its time and nobody says it didn't work, but if you're going cross-country today, a new Cadillac or Boeing jet will serve your purposes much better.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun Fruiting Chamber
