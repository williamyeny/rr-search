Mushrooms aren't plants. Mushrooms aren't converting light into energy.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Says who?<br /><br />I think it's pretty damned obvious that mycelium is converting light into some other form of energy that is useful to it.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown with proper lighting pin more prolifically, grow fatter and meatier with considerably more finish weight, and are more vigorous and healthy looking.<br /><br />It's worthless to compare mushrooms to plants.&nbsp; Mycelium is as different from plants as we are.&nbsp; The absence of photosynthesis doesn't mean the mycelium isn't deriving energy from the light.<br /><br />To answer the original poster, you'll get mushrooms from the HPS.&nbsp; It will make up somewhat in intensity what it lacks in proper spectrum.&nbsp; I've had excellent results with a 400 watt MH which was already running in the room anyway.&nbsp; MH is around 4,000 Kelvin,&nbsp; which is closer to what we're looking for than an HPS which tends to run around 2700 Kelvin.&nbsp; As said above, unless you're already running the HPS for something else, get a fluorescent fixture and save the HPS for another day.<br />RR","title":"Re: So, has anyone successfully
