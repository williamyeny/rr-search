ingredients that we view as having more nutes? <br /></blockquote><br /><br />A few years ago when I started growing on coffee, folks said, \"coffee has no nutes\", so how can mushrooms grow on it?&nbsp; A year or two later when I started growing on coir and called it a bulk substrate ingredient, people said, \"coir has no nutes, how can you grow on it\".&nbsp; Now, they're saying it about vermiculite.&nbsp; I really don't care 'what' the mycelium is eating in the verm.&nbsp; I do know that it consumes the verm, and not just the moisture within.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />hat about using equal parts verm to manure? <br /></blockquote><br /><br />It's what I've been recommending for a few years now.&nbsp; Use verm at up to half of any bulk substrate.&nbsp; In fact, you can mix your colonized rye grain or wbs half and half with verm, and it will fruit as well as if you'd used manure, coir, castings, coffee, compost, whatever.<br />RR","title":"Re: PF tek w/o
