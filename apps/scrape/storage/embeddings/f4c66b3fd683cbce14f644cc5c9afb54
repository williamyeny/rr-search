intact(helps retain log moisture level) the longer the log will produce. </blockquote><br />It's not just about moisture, but fruiting surface.&nbsp; The mushrooms form on the bark, not the bare wood.&nbsp; Smack them with a rubber or rawhide mallet if necessary to protect the bark, or pour in some wax to seal the damage if the bark gets torn.<br />Concussion is a well known shiitake pinning trigger.&nbsp; Shiitake also fruit all summer, and many of my best strains such as S75 don't react to a cold shock at all, so I skip it.<br />In addition, shiitake will perform better on sawdust than on whole logs outdoors as well as indoors, so growers should take note.&nbsp; Some of the sawdust blocks below are in their third and fourth years fruiting and only a fraction of original size.<br
