He corrected it very well in the 1990's when he wrote 'Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms', where he correctly stated they are antibiotic compounds.<br /><br />Furthermore, the journal of medicinal mushrooms publishes articles on a regular basis identifying the various antibiotic compounds in various species of mushroom mycelial metabolites.<br /><br />The first mass use of metabolites in medicine was in WW2 when the production of metabolites from the Penicillium mold saved thousands of Allied soldiers lives due to a product that was named Penicillin after the mycelium metabolites it was made from.  I'm completely in awe that you folks don't know this.  It should have been taught in elementary and junior high school, both in history and science. It's not brand new news.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is a time and place for vulgarities.  I'm no prude and no religious freak by a long shot, but in science one need not use vulgar terms if he wishes to be taken seriously.  I'll be the first one to let out a four letter tirade over politics when I'm having a few beers down at the pub, but not here, and not in conjunction with mycology.  I hope this clears it up.   I'll stay on it until people stop using the wrong terms.  It's no different than correcting someone for referring to an uncased bulk substrate incorrectly as a 'casing' or referring to manure as a spawn, rather than a substrate, etc.  It's simply incorrect an should be corrected or new growers trying to learn get fed the wrong information.  Peace and good luck to all<br />RR","title":"Re: mycelium
