should read more.<br />EVERYONE doesn't know you have to have 6500K.&nbsp; The optimum range is 5000K to 7000K with a peak at 6500K.&nbsp; Cool white fluorescent lamps are generally 5000K to 5500K, putting them right in the optimum performance range for growing mushrooms.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>bestscreenname said:</strong><br />any 6500K light bulb will work, wattage doesnt matter.</blockquote><br />Wattage does matter, at least to a point.&nbsp; Mushrooms derive energy from light, and grow far larger and heavier when grown in the presence of sufficient light.&nbsp; Mushrooms aren't plants and don't have need of 1 kilowatt lighting, but don't think you can put a 13 watt cfl in a ceiling fixture and have good performance from substrates several feet away.<br
