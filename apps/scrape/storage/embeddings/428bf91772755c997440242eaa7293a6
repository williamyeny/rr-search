casing from cakes?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />The 'casing' is simply the top layer that is placed over the substrate.&nbsp; It has no nutrient value and is only to supply moisture and beneficial organisms.&nbsp; If your casing layer is loose and airy as it should be, it will create little air pockets of high humidity that can help stimulate pinning.<br /><br />You'll still need to colonize cakes or grains as spawn to inoculate your bulk substrates, that you'll later case if desired.&nbsp; Casing layers benefit cubensis very little if you're good at managing light, moisture, and air exchange.&nbsp; With soaking/dunking, casing layers have become obsolete, in my opinion.&nbsp; Some species won't fruit without a casing layer, but <i>P cubensis</i> isn't in that catagory.<br /><br />Many old hands still swear by them, but if you'll manage your substrate properly, you can achieve the same end results uncased.&nbsp; You'll have fewer fruits, but they'll be larger.&nbsp; A properly maintained casing layer can produce&nbsp; wall to wall fruits, but they'll be smaller.&nbsp; Overall yields hardly change.<br />RR","title":"Re: finally got my
