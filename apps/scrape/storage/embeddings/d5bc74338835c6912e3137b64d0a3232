when people act like they can grow from a print and get a certain 'strain', which is ludicrous.&nbsp; That is why we say a cube is a cube.&nbsp; It doesn't mean they're all the same, and every substrain develops its own characteristics, but the only way you'll grow that same strain again is if it's a single sector isolate.&nbsp; The name on a print doesn't define a strain.&nbsp; That's only marketing.<br />Cubes only evolved in tropical climates.&nbsp; There are no temperate region cubensis.&nbsp; This isn't true with species such as P ostreatus, which might grow on Alder in Alaska or palm trees in the tropics, yet it's the same species, and the strains really are different from each other.&nbsp; You must also keep in mind that the spores float on the winds, which carry them thousands of miles and they'll grow anytime they land on a suitable area, blending the 'strains' from one region to another.&nbsp; P cubensis from Thailand isn't much different from P cubensis from Florida in the US.<br />By the way, Paul never said 86F is the optimum 'incubation' temperature.&nbsp; That's being misread.&nbsp; He was quoting another study which found a 'mycelium' temperature of 86F resulted in the fastest lineal growth on a petri dish.&nbsp; My own studies have found that threshold begins to fall off above 83F, which is a very slight difference.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why
