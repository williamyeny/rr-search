finally fruits, it would be very uneven.&nbsp; It would be like three mice sharing a cage, as opposed to one mouse.&nbsp; Less room for all, and the amount of food to keep them sustained would need to be much more.&nbsp; If you kept the same amount of food as for one mouse, they would all suffer.</blockquote><br />Nice analogy</blockquote><br />But incorrect.<br />Don't confuse 'strain' with 'species'.&nbsp; Strains of the same species don't compete with each other.&nbsp; They usually combine into a single organism, but even if they're non-compatible strains, they'll each simply occupy the part of the substrate they were able to colonize, and then fruit normally.&nbsp; You could take ten jars of spawn, all inoculated from either the same 'strain' or even each inoculated with different 'named strains' and mix them all at spawning to bulk.&nbsp; It would be no different from any other multispore grow.<br />If you want to talk about 'competing' for substrate, you'd need to be mixing different species, such as Shiitake and Oyster in the same substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can i mix my jars of mycelium
