For example, as humans grow, they produce more cells. As a fetus reaches maturity in the womb, it's multiplied its cells from the zygote stage to term exponentially.<br />Conversely, the cells in a mushroom simply swell with water as they grow. A fully mature mushroom has the same amount of cells (and thus, psilocybin content) as when it was a pin. </blockquote><br />This is incorrect.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium and mycelium grows via cell division.&nbsp; A fully mature mushroom has more cells than a pin.&nbsp; I'm sure there's also some swelling going on as the cells engorge with water, but it's certainly not an either/or thing.<br />Smaller fruits on a substrate are generally more potent per gram than larger fruits on the same substrate though.&nbsp; That's a fact.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is mushroom size contradictory
