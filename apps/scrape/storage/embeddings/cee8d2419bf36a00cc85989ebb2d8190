won't buy or sell a product unless it's professionally made, replicated from glass masters, individually packaged with UPC codes, has copyright filed with the US government, an ISBN number, has a professional cover design, individually shrink wrapped, etc.&nbsp; That shit ain't cheap, so why skimp on production?&nbsp; If you guys think it's easy to get crystal clear full screen agar shots on petri dishes, just look at 99% of the crap posted here and find some.<br />I'm not interested in how to do things the cheap, lazy or easy way.&nbsp; I'm only interested in doing things the absolutely best way I possibly can.&nbsp; I turned down a huge opportunity with walmart because I didn't want to get the disks stamped out at a plant in china just for them, as they demanded.&nbsp; If people don't want to support a quality made in USA product, that's too bad.&nbsp; I won't do it any other way.&nbsp; As for the music, I interviewed local Seattle bands until I gave up.&nbsp; They sucked, and I didn't want to play the only two or three good songs they could do over and over again for four hours.&nbsp; I now have enough royalty paid music to do ten more DVDs should the market situation change.<br />I didn't make the DVD for broke college kids to learn how to grow drugs.&nbsp; I made it for individuals who want to get into mushrooms for the health benefits to learn how to get started.&nbsp; That's why it focuses on edibles.&nbsp; If one wants to take the information on edibles and use it to grow cubes, that's their business, just like pot growers often buy Rodale press books on organic gardening.&nbsp; My hope is that in the coming years, mushrooms are going to be big, like gardening is today or even bigger.<br />I also hope that my product will be on the market for many years to come, just like paul stamets books are still selling after 25 years.&nbsp; My only point was that I spent an awfully lot of money to produce a product that gets illegally downloaded at least 100 times for every purchase, and I only make $5 over replication cost on each purchase, with all the expenses outlined in the previous post coming out of that $5.&nbsp; I had to stop selling direct from my site to get national distributors, and I have a gentleman's agreement with the shroomery vendors who buy it wholesale it not to compete with them.<br />I only ask that if you want the product, please pay me for it.&nbsp; It represents the collective experience gained from growing mushrooms since 1972, and the teks outlined do one thing very well. . .They work.<br />RR","title":"Re:
