A mini-greenhouse is really not suitable for cakes unless you put the cool mist directly INSIDE the greenhouse so it can recirculate your moist air, adding additional humidity to it.<br />CO2 should not be allowed to build up, then vented.  For best results, have constant air exchange during fruiting.  It's counterproductive to use a humidifier for air exchange.  You will never get the humidity high enough for cakes if you're pumping in fresh air with a humidifier.  Rather, leave the door unzipped or cut slits in the sides of the plastic both top and bottom to allow for constant air exchange and circulation.<br />Place the humidifier(s) on a bottom shelf or floor of the greenhouse.  Humidity in mini-greenhouses seems to stratify into layers with higher humidity near the top and lower at the bottom.  By placing the humidifiers on the bottom of the unit, the air drawn into the humidifier will cause circulation from the top back down, thus equalizing the humidity.<br />You need a floor.  Easiest is to use plastic sheeting and duct tape it to the sides.  To catch drips, use trays of damp perlite.  These will return the drips to the air as humidity.<br />I spent years modifying humidifiers before I worked out this method.  A humidifier that has been modified has a life span in weeks, sometimes months, but not years the way an unmodified unit has.  My two coolmists on the floor of my greenhouse are now over two years old without failing.  Also, when it fails, you can't return a drilled out humidifier to the store.<br />Using the above system, I can easily keep my greenhouse at 95% to 99% humidity which is what's required for cakes or substrate blocks of sawdust during fruiting.  You'll need a good cycle timer for the humidifiers.  Don't let them run more than a few minutes at a time, followed by another few minutes of 'off' time.<br />When you're first filling up the greenhouse, place trays of damp perlite on any empty shelf space.  A greenhouse full of substrate is much easier to keep moist than an empty one, so the trays of perlite make up the difference.<br />RR","title":"Re: 60 in Martha Closet setup
