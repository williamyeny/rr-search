everybody can be on the same page.&nbsp; The word <i>casing</i> is a verb.&nbsp; It is the <u>act</u> of applying a casing layer.&nbsp; There is no plural form to verbs, so the word 'casings' doesn't exist, and the hair on my neck stands up every time I see it.<br /><i>Cased substrates</i> should be maintained as close to 100% humidity as you can.&nbsp; While a casing layer makes a substrate less dependent on saturation humidity, providing it will result in best results.<br />Use a damp towel wrapped around a hygrometer to calibrate or test it for accuracy.&nbsp; Hygrometers are only accurate over a very short range, and salt checks accuracy at around 70%, while a damp towel will see how accurate it is at 99%.<br />RR","title":"Re: Water droplets, bad or good for
