There isn't going to be any bad bacteria or some mutant organism or organisms from that? And my chances of NOT getting sick is guaranteed? Because that is what I am understanding from all of this, If a pigeon lands on my bbq'd hamburger takes a shit, I can eat that burger and be just as healthy and if not more contaminant free? And somehow it will benefit me in the long run. That doesn't make any sense to me. Even if it was 5 percent, everybody is saying go ahead and eat that, because it's only 5 percent. Nobody questions that or wonders if maybe that isn't accurate? So go ahead and just do that there will be no future consequences in that, that's what I am reading on here. And I am apparently am butthurt because I ask questions and require proof? How the fuck does that work out????<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Quoted for posterity.<br /><br />Don't eat bird shit.&nbsp; If you think that toxins or bacteria in the manure substrate is going to be conducted into the fruits, then you don't understand how fungi works.&nbsp; There is no vascular system for circulation in fungi.&nbsp; Nutrients and moisture must travel from cell to cell through the mycelium.&nbsp; This is why mycelium makes such a great filter.&nbsp; No bacteria from the manure can possibly be in the mushrooms. <br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b>MadSeasonStudent said:</b><br />Where is the proof that we can eat pigeon waste and still be healthy and not have an effect on ourselves, as a result? OP wants to direct me to Google for the answers, that is not sufficient evidence.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Now, that is just over the top.&nbsp; Nobody is suggesting anyone eat manure of any kind.&nbsp; Please do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up before somebody brings out a ban hammer and slaps the 'tard out of you.&nbsp; I said Please.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about pigeon
