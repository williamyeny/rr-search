1/4\" holes two inches apart, and you'll have 95% or greater humidity, which is a secondary concern anyway.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger.<br /><br />No, you don't think of mushrooms as bananas or apples.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium.&nbsp; A banana is different than a banana tree.&nbsp; A mushroom is not different from the mycelium in the substrate.<br /><br />How
