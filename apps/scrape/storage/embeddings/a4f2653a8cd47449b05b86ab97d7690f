said:</strong><br />Well I already have a 4\" filter.&nbsp; It's 24\"X48\" enclosed in aluminum with a 12\" hole on the back to attach a duct.&nbsp; It's rated 720 CFM flow at 0.50 inches.&nbsp; </blockquote><br />That's a filter, but you're not going to get laminar flow from it even if you found a way to hook a motor up.&nbsp; At that flow and that static pressure, there's no way it's going to give laminar flow.&nbsp; Look for a flow hood HEPA, which will be at least 5 1/2\" thick.&nbsp; Most are 7\" to 11\" thick.&nbsp; You'll want to build a plenum behind the filter roughly as large as the area of the filter itself.&nbsp; This pressurized plenum is how you obtain laminar flow.&nbsp; You'll want to pressurize the plenum to .9\" to 1.2\" WC.&nbsp; If you ever put that much pressure behind the filter you describe, it would blow far too hard for mycology use.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is an inline duct fan or for a flow
