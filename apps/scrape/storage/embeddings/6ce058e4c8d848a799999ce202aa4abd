The casing is the non-nutritious layer on the top.  It would be impossible to flip that over.<br /><br />Two important factors to consider are, one: when the mycelium goes from vegetative mode to fruiting mode, it tends to stay there.  If you try to re-case a substrate, the new casing just sits there and never colonizes.  This leaves it open to contaminants.  Two: Most of the primordia for the first two or three flushes are set at the same time as first flush.  Therefore, these primordia are waiting for you to harvest the preceding flush so they can begin to grow.  If you flip the substrate over, these primordia are now on the bottom where they can't grow.<br /><br />It's best to leave the substrate right side up whether you soak or not. Fill in the divots with fresh casing material, but don't 're-case' the whole substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you fip your casing
