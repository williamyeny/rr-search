I hope you don't think that with nearly 50,000 members, you're the first one to purchase <i>The Mushroom Cultivator.</i><br /><br />Nobody knows a 'specific wavelength' of light that mushrooms pin best at. In mushroom growing, the whole is often greater than the sum of the parts, so one can't point to a single item that makes things work or not.&nbsp; What many hundreds of successful mushroom growers know is that you'll get 'some' pins with any ol' light source, even a 60 watt bulb on the ceiling.&nbsp; However, for the best pinset, it's been shown time and time again that fluorescent lighting, or indirect lighting from a bright window works best.&nbsp; It's also been shown that fluorescent lamps in the 6,500 Kelvin range work better than the others.<br /><br />When you have a few dozen successful grows using some other light source, feel free to chime in with your results, along with your pictures and methods.&nbsp; Until then, be very careful calling the info presented by experienced growers here wrong, just because the latest research contradicts one of the first mushroom growing books for homegrowers ever written.&nbsp; We've learned an awful lot since then.<br /><br />Re-invent the wheel if you want to, but be very careful not to act high and mighty while you do it.&nbsp; Light is only a secondary pinning trigger anyway, so there's far more important parameters to worry about learning first, before you even get to the need for lighting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pins on brf jars again!
