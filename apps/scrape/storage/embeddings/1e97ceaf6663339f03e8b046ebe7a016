said:</strong><br />Ok so I ran out of mineral water for my TIT incubator so I put tap water in and added a few drops of non bio chlorine neutralizer the stuff thats for making water safe for gold fish it just takes the choline out the water but Ive also added bleach to stop the water going stagnant even tho I have a air pump filter so i just added a a little squirt now it smells like a swimming pool in my incubator but im worried about mixing the chemicals and the potential fumes that may be given off as its also being heated with an aquarium heater does any one know if these chemicals are safe together does any know what non bio tap safe for fish acutely is and weather it will be safe to mixed with bleach as google cant tell me nothing useful bit of a weird one I know thanks ...........Angel</blockquote><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>Angel-2-one said:</strong><br />What about the chlorine tho and the mist possible getting into my incubation box with my jars&nbsp; via vapour you see originally I was just using a air pump filter with the tap safe (choline neutralizer ) and no bleach but most people said that the air pump filter wouldn't keep it from going stagnant alone so I added a little bleach and it only hit me today that maybe I shouldnt of mixed them together ...to be honest I think I may go back to using the air pump filter and the tap safe as theirs only a little amount of water and after 4 days the water was still fresh and sum said the filter would stop it from going stagnant but would have to be changed every few weeks just like chemicals as im not big on chemicals but I dont mind a few drop of tap safe thats why I onley do shrooms bit of a new age hippie&nbsp; ??</blockquote><br />On your keyboard right between the comma and the slash key is an interesting symbol called a period.&nbsp; Please use it and try to form coherent sentences.&nbsp; That is just too hard to read while trying to decipher what you're trying to say.<br />I fail to see why you would use bleach, and then an acid to neutralize it.&nbsp; In fact, I fail to see why you would be compelled to use such an outdated device in the first place, but that's not the point.&nbsp; You can dunk cakes in up to a ten percent bleach solution, so why would you think it's going to harm the plastic tubs, and why would you want to use mineral water in the first place?<br />RR","title":"Re: chlorine neutralizer mixed with bleach any one know if its
