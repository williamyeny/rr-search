Hydraulic actuated tripods for each camera to give smooth pans added another $1500 for each one. Color temperature balanced lights and umbrella stands are over $900 each, and I purchased 10 of them for filming that video.&nbsp; UHF wireless microphones with multiple channels set me back another $3,000 and the wired microphone for the voice overs was another grand.&nbsp; The commercial Adobe software to upload, edit and produce video, and make the original studio masters set me back $10,000 and then as Roadkill said, I took off from my regular job for over a year, to work full time on that project.&nbsp; I paid $10,000 to buy royalties on the music alone.&nbsp; Nothing I used was downloaded from the internet, it was all purchased with our life savings, including the banner fees I pay to the shroomery every single month to be a sponsor here, even though I don't even sell the video-it's available through other shroomery sponsors or amazon.&nbsp; <br />In addition, I paid to have glass masters made, and every DVD set is stamped from the original glass, ensuring consistent quality.&nbsp; Nothing is burned.<br />All those mushrooms, mycelium, petri dishes, grain jars, and test tube slants didn't grow themselves, and I had to set up the studio equipment to film all the segments, just as the mycelium was at the right stage in growth.<br />Add to all that, Mrs Rabbit has cancer, and was going through chemotherapy just as I/we were filming, so she was sick all the time, and the medical bills were piling up, and still are-except now I have to drive her 150 miles just to get to the doctor.&nbsp; I spent the money we had for doctor bills on producing a professional quality DVD, hoping to save her life with the income it would produce.&nbsp; Now that I get it done, at least half the members here have downloaded the video from torrent sites illegally, stealing medicine directly from a sick lady who would cut off her own arm to help a total stranger.&nbsp; It just isn't right, and we're heartbroken over it.<br />If things change and people stop stealing from us, I might make another video that covers things that wouldn't fit on the fist one, along with the latest projects I've been working on in absolute secrecy. Until then, I've suspended work on anything but a mycology and mushroom cultivation textbook I'm writing for use in public and private schools.&nbsp; When you guys see my video on torrent sites, please try to convince whoever is offering it to take it down.&nbsp; They're not spreading knowledge, they're keeping it bottled up.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is RR coming out with a new
