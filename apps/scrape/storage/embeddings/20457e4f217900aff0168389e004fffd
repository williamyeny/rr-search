Then, when your project molds and all you get are aborts, come back and listen to those who have done this thousands of times before you.<br />All of this has been covered many times before in this forum and the information is there if you'll only do a few searches, or an hour or two of reading.  People are tired of typing the same thing over and over and over again in detail for those who don't want to use the search function, or look for the answers on their own a little. I have explained this exact question you're asking dozens of times in the last year.  You've been pointed in the right direction.  Either go with that or ignore the advice.  It's your choice.<br />RR","title":"Re: reptile humidifier.. great idea, but do i need it for
