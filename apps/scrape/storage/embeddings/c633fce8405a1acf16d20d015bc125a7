I want to develop the relationship there so with a simple plug and chuck equation. One where you just put in the values of your chamber and it spits out the corresponding hole size and spacing.<br />Forgive me if that went above some heads or seems like a dumb question.</blockquote><br />The only head you went above is yours.&nbsp; You can't <i>calculate</i> flow because it will be different under various atmospheric pressure and temperature scenarios, both of which are constantly in flux.&nbsp; The conditions in your bedroom today won't be the conditions in your bedroom tomorrow or in my bedroom at any time.<br />This is why we recommend 1/4\" holes every 2\" around the tub. It provides an excellent mushroom growing environment over a wide variety of conditions. <br />RR","title":"Re: SGFC
