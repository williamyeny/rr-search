often a human hair that expands and contracts due to humidity.&nbsp; Any of you members with long hair knows this happens.&nbsp; This hair pulls against a spring which is attached to the dial.&nbsp; It's a simple instrument, but is only accurate through a narrow band, because a hair will only expand and contract so much, regardless of the change in humidity.<br /><br />If you're using the hygrometer in your house, or in a cigar humidor, use the salt method, since that is the range you want it to be accurate in.<br /><br />If you're using the hygrometer in a fruiting chamber, use the damp towel method, since you want your accuracy in the 95% range.<br />RR","title":"Re: Another issue with
