Lumens don't matter. Think about it. Shrooms don't grow in open sunshine.&nbsp; Light cycle is most important. <br />C</blockquote><br />Disregard nonsense like this.&nbsp; Cubensis grows in Texas and Florida in open cow pastures in direct sun.<br />Lumens are irrelevant.&nbsp; They're just numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., and mean nothing unless they are delineated over a specific area.(Lux)<br />Lux is an important measure because it refers to the amount of light over a given area. We want very bright light.&nbsp; Watts are a measure of power consumed, but not of the amount of light.&nbsp; The reason we say a 13W to 26W is fine for a terrarium is simply based on experience, but that light fixture must be within a few inches of the terrarium to be of much use.<br />Mycelium uses light as a source of energy.&nbsp; More light leads to better performance. There is no defined upper limit for light exposure.&nbsp; When I grew in a room with 4000K metal halide 400 watt lamps, performance was better than with 6500K CFL lamps. The latter had a closer color temp to ideal, but the former made up for it with intensity.<br />RR","title":"Re: Light clarification question (re: RR's
