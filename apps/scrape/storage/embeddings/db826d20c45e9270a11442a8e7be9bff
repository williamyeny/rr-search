You never case with a substrate material.  You want to spawn your grains or brf cakes into your substrate, which would be straw, coir, manure, etc.  Consider 3\" to 4\" the maximum depth.  Beyond that, things get iffy real quick.<br />The casing is the non-nutritious top layer you put on after the substrate has become colonized with mushroom mycelium.  Consider 1\" the maximum depth of casing, but 1/2\" to 3/4\" is probably better yet.  I rarely use over 1/2\" of casing, even with deep substrates.<br />Other species of interest to people here require a thin substrate and casing layer.  For example, Pan cyans rarely fruit from a substrate over 1 1/2\" thick.  If you're growing those, keep your manure layer thin, and apply a very thin casing layer, such as 1/4\".<br />RR","title":"Re: What is the best substrate layer
