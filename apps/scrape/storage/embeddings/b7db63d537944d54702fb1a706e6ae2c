However, a pf jar is <i>spawn</i> when used to inoculate manure or straw, etc.<br />Rye is a <i>spawn</i> when used to inoculate manure or straw, etc., but is a <i>substrate</i> when cased with peat-verm or verm-coir, although coir is better suited as a substrate than a casing material.  If you mix the rye in as an inoculant, it's <i>spawn</i>, but if you lay it in a tray and apply a casing layer over the top of it, the rye becomes the <i>substrate</i>.<br />A <u>bulk</u> substrate is a large amount of material that supports mushroom growth that you spawn your mycelium into.  Bulk substrates can be manure, straw, coir, worm castings, coffee grinds, etc.  Grains can spawn to a bulk substrate, or serve <i>as</i> the substrate, but are never considered a 'bulk' substrate.<br
