measures RELATIVE humidity, which is a measure of the <i>capacity</i> of the air to hold water.&nbsp; A 20F rise in temperature allows the air to hold roughly twice as much moisture.&nbsp; Therefore, if your air is at 50% humidity and 70F, a drop to 50F, would lower the temperature to the dewpoint and you'd have 100% humidity.<br />RR","title":"Re:
