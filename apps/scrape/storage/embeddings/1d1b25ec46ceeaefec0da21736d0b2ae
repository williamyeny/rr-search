Right where the human eyes sees best. <br /><br />Color temp can be misleading also just by having more relative output at one end of the spectrum than the other. For example you can have a bulb with a color temp equating to the red end even if its putting out the full blue spectrum just by having it putting out 50% less in relative power of blue than red.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I don't really know where to start with this.&nbsp; As said above, I had a legal medical mj grow and mushrooms at the same time when Mrs Rabbit was getting chemo.&nbsp; The mushrooms did very well near a 400 watt MH, to my surprise since my MH fixtures put out around 4100K according to my white balancing chart. They made up in intensity what they lacked in the 'perfect' color temperature.&nbsp; In addition, color temperature is indeed the <i>perfect</i> parameter for mushrooms.&nbsp; I've grown hundreds of tons of mushrooms under all sorts of conditions, both indoors and out. I doubt any member here has that level of experience, or even close. <br /><br />I can say for an absolute fact that a color temperature of 6500 Kelvin is perfect for indoor growing under artificial light.&nbsp; Above or below that and performance-per-watt falls off.&nbsp; This isn't science, it's nature.&nbsp; Mushrooms seem to respond to a wider range of light than a single wavelength, thus the color temperature parameter is perfect, and as a bonus it's the way lamps are labeled from the manufacturer, making it the perfect method of selection.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Boosting lumens is not going to increase growth because fungi do not use light in the way plants do, its simply and on or off switch. More light aint gonna make it more on. <br /></blockquote><br />That is patently false.&nbsp; More light <b>does indeed</b> translate into more mushrooms and larger mushrooms.&nbsp; This has absolutely nothing to do with plants.&nbsp; This is a mushroom forum, and mushrooms use light in their own way. Mushrooms are more closely related to humans than to plants, so leave plants out of any discussion of fungi please.<br />RR","title":"Re: question about
