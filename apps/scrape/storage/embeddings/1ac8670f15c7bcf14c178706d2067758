6400K cfl.</blockquote><br />That will work fine since you already have it.&nbsp; 7,000K is well within the optimum range.<br />Also, to Mad Hatter, I was speaking above of lux as I said, not lumens.&nbsp; Always think in extremes to understand a point.&nbsp; A bright bulb a mile away would do little good.&nbsp; That's why we don't think in terms of brightness of the bulb alone, but in brightness vs distance.&nbsp; Lux is thus a more accurate representation of the amount of energy available at the substrate level than lumens.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fruits grow larger during the dark
