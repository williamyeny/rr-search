What separates us from the competition is that no mushrooms were grown in our product, so all the micronutrients, trace elements and other conditioning agents are still available to your plants. Nothing has been used up from the growing of mushrooms.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That quote was taken from your link.&nbsp; It proves they're 100% full of shit.&nbsp; The mushrooms don't 'use up' nutrients needed by plants, they break them down so they become <i>available</i> for the plants.&nbsp; Plants have no direct use whatsoever for manure.&nbsp; The manure must first be broken down by bacteria and fungi before the plants can use it.&nbsp; I'd avoid that product.&nbsp; If you have any doubt, sterilize some manure and then try to grow plants on it. <br /><br />Go to a horse ranch and offer to clean up their pasture.&nbsp; You'll get all the field aged manure you could ever want.<br />RR","title":"Re: Organic Mushroom compost blend w/ sphagnum, maker swears it's not been
