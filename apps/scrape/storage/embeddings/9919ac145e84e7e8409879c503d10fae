spores germinate into hyphae, which are single strands of branched monokaryotic mycelium and generally unable to produce fruits.&nbsp; When hyphae from compatible spores meet, they may or may not 'mate' and become dikaryotic, meaning there will be two or more nuclei in each cell.&nbsp; Whether monokaryotic or dikaryotic, it's still mycelium, as is the conidial mycelium produced by molds.<br /><br />Mycelium = singular form<br />mycelia&nbsp; = plural form<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Instead of your mycelium are colonizing good?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Since mycelium is the singular form, you would use 'is' rather than 'are' so that sentence would correctly read, \"your mycelium is colonizing well\".&nbsp; If you want to use the word 'good', then you'd say \"your mycelium is looking good\".&nbsp; Hopefully, a grammar/nomenclature lesson is what you were asking for.&nbsp; If not, sorry.<br />RR","title":"Re: how should it be
