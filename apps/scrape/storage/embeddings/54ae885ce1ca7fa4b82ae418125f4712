if you were to regulate the heat of your jars, wouldn't it be best to keep ambient temperature a bit higher after inoculation/G2G, then drop it down as the mycelium colonizes?</blockquote><br />Yes, you can do that, but if you're constantly starting new projects as the earlier ones colonize, it increases your workload.<br />Bear in mind, glass is an insulator, so even if the substrate within is smaller, the heat has a harder time escaping than it does from a plastic bag which doesn't insulate nearly as much. <br />I've previously reported up to a 20F heat difference in colonizing spawn bags vs the ambient air around them.&nbsp; In fact, it's the only heat source planned for my underground colonization room.&nbsp; Considering that it will hold over 1500 substrate blocks and is very well insulated, I suspect I'll have to keep a window open even in winter, to preventing overheating.<br />RR","title":"Re: Internal
