to the unit as the contents cool.&nbsp; This is important if you're canning, because as the jars of jam cool, a vacuum is pulled in the jar, sucking the lid down tight.&nbsp; If there was a vacuum in the PC, the jars would never seal.<br /><br />In a sterilizer, the unit is completely air tight, therefore as it cools to below 212F/100C, no air is admitted, thus a vacuum is pulled in the vessel.&nbsp; This vacuum holds until you lift the toggle to release it.&nbsp; I do this in front of a laminar flow hood, thus only sterile air is admitted to the sterilizer.&nbsp; If you use a sterilizer for agar, it will boil over as a vacuum is pulled, so you'd want a canner, OR you'd have to babysit the sterilizer to lift the toggle exactly as zero psi is reached.<br /><br />I prefer a sterilizer when preparing rye grain or sawdust/woodchip bags.&nbsp; The sterilizer ensures the contents of the bags remain completely sterile, even if it's a few days before I can get to them after sterilization.&nbsp; Nothing bad is admitted, and besides, nothing can grow in a vacuum.<br />RR","title":"Re: A Little confusion- converting an All American 921 into a
