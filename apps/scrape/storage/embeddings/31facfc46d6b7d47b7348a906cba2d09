{"key":"embedding-6727446","value":{"id":6727446,"first":6723152,"last":6792926,"when":1175267182,"utime":"03/30/07 06:06 PM","content":"80F is fine for incubating, but don't exceed 81F or growth will slow.  86F is not optimal for cubensis.  Stamets quoted somebody else who supposedly put out some petri dishes in various temperatures and reported that to him, so he printed it.  I've tried to duplicate that experiment, and after several times, I reached the positive conclusion that mycelium rate of growth is fairly flat from 75F to 83F, with it falling off sharply at 84F and above.<br />It should also be noted that glass is an insulator, so the heat produced by the mycelium has no place to go and can easily spiral up into the range where growth falls off and thermophilic molds are encouraged.  That's why I recommend normal room temperature for incubation, even if it is a tad slower.  The benefits of a lower contamination rate far outweigh the extra day or two earlier they might colonize at a slightly warmer temperature.  besides, you should be waiting a week after full colonization anyway before birthing or spawning in order to allow the mycelium to consolidate its hold on the substrate.<br />As for fruiting temperatures, the lower 70's seems to produce the best fruit quality.  For years, I didn't AC my house in the summer because I live in a generally mild climate, and they still fruited fine into the 90's, which my grow area would often reach on summer afternoons.  I found that temperatures which would fry the mycelium during colonization, would hardly be a factor during fruiting, but the fruits grew very fast, were not very meaty, and the 'other' quality we look for was often lacking.<br />When I switched over to all edible and medicinal mushrooms, I installed a refrigeration unit on my mini-greenhouse, because mushrooms such as shiitake would refuse to fruit at all in those hot temperatures.<br />Light is very important after full colonization, when an increase in FAE is made.  Enough light to 'see the tray' is absolutely NOT enough light unless you're happy with shitty pinsets.  Brighter light is better.  Higher frequency(blue) light such as is emitted by 'natural daylight fluorescent' tubes which produce light at 6500K are best from mine and Stamets tests.  Cool white fluorescent tubes would be a second, lower cost choice and will work fine.  Incandescent bulbs which emit 'red' light at 3000K are the worst choice.  In addition, 24 hour light is extremely counter productive because hyphal knots form, and the fruit bodies seem to grow the most during the period of darkness.  You can all prove that by simply measuring your growing mushrooms when you turn the light on, and again when you shut it off.  You'll find growth is higher during the dark phase.   <br />Mycelium needs light for much more than for the mushrooms to 'know which way is up'.  Upon full colonization and a reduction in CO2 levels brought about by increased FAE, light becomes an important pinning trigger, and must be bright enough to penetrate the casing layer so that hyphal knots can form from deep within the casing instead of just on top.  Dim light will produce 'some' pins, but if you want one of those wall to wall flushes, use bright light.  I hope this helps clear up any confusion.<br />RR","title":"Re: New Here and just really tryin to absorb all of the
