I wonder, if I put dye in the substrate and water, would there be any chance that the mushrooms would change color? I think it'd be pointless but cool, and would be usefull if you had different strains mixed together that looked the same, but you'd need to tell apart. Any thoughts?</blockquote><br />Think about this for one second.<br />If putting food coloring in the substrate worked, wouldn't mushrooms grown on brf cakes be tan, and wouldn't mushrooms grown on manure be dark brown?<br />It doesn't work.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium metabolizes its food.&nbsp; It doesn't have a vascular system like roses to draw coloring up from the root system to the flower.&nbsp; Mushrooms are as different from plants as a lizard is from an cactus.<br />RR","title":"Re: Red, green or blue
