substrates, but no longer do.&nbsp; However, I pasteurize straw in a lime bath at pH 12, and then spawn the straw after draining and without rinsing, and the mycelium rips right through it, so as the penn state guys noticed, mushroom mycelium has a wide range of acceptance. <br /><br />My tests were with petri dishes at pH levels .5 apart, from 5 to 9.&nbsp; Lineal growth peaked at a pH slightly lower than neutral.&nbsp; I suppose there's nothing 'wrong' with liming substrates if it doesn't cause harm, but I just haven't seen that it does any good either.&nbsp; If you want a good calcium supplement, use gypsum, which has little effect on pH.<br />RR","title":"Re: ANyone ever use this ph
