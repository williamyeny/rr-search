out wrong.<br /><br />Light does play a major role in the size of the mushrooms.&nbsp; Mushrooms derive 'energy' from light, and bright high frequency light will grow larger mushrooms with more finish weight.&nbsp; Commercial mushroom farms have proved this fact beyond debate.<br /><br />HPS has a very low color temperature and is not the best frequency of light to use.&nbsp; Most are around 2700 Kelvin, while mycelium pins and produces the largest mushrooms when given light at around 6500 Kelvin.<br /><br />Light does not tell mushrooms which way to grow.&nbsp; They grow opposite gravity in the absence of light.&nbsp; Mushrooms turn towards light because they are benefiting from it.<br /><br />Light is a pinning trigger, increases growth and vigor of mushrooms after pinning, and helps to coordinate the circadian rhythm when run in a normal day/night routine that includes warmer daytime and cooler night time temperatures.<br /><br />The lights that are proved to work best are 'natural daylight' fluorescent in the 6500 Kelvin range.&nbsp; I'm running tests on LEDs and will report back the results once I've confirmed them though multiple grows.<br /><br /><a
