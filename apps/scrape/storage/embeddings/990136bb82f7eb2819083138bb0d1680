I see no evidence whatsoever of it being \"disproven\", and this thread is not at all about that.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />For the record, the whole blue light nonsense came into being 30 years ago when TMC was being written.&nbsp; A cubensis grow was being conducted in total darkness, except for taking a photograph once a day.&nbsp; The substrate pinned, therefore it was (incorrectly) deduced that 430 nm or whatever the 35mm camera flash projected for a millisecond or two is what triggered the fruiting.&nbsp; We now know that cubensis pins and fruits in total darkness, even if poorly.<br /><br />Best pinning and growth performance will come from a normal day/night schedule with lights in the 5000K to 7000K range, or a bright window.&nbsp; Above and below that they'll still work, but performance isn't at its peak.&nbsp; Light is far more important <i>after pinning</i>, since mushrooms will grow far larger and heavier in the presence of bright 'daylight' spectrum lighting.<br /><br />As for the other point, how exactly is a bacterium going to interact with a salt to produce food for mycelium?<br />RR","title":"Re: Waste no grain, use no 'bulk'! •Seed &
