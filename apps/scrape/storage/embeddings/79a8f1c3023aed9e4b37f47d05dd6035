but it won't hurt.&nbsp; Don't get too 'blue'.&nbsp; In other words, a color temperature of 6500K is perfect.&nbsp; If you go above 7500K, performance will drop off.<br />A good rule of thumb is the brighter you can make it without impacting humidity via excess heat is going to be OK.&nbsp; Mushrooms derive energy from the light to convert sugars in the substrate to ATP in the cells, but via a different mechanism than the one plants use.<br />Mushrooms are 100% mycelium, so don't change color spectrum as you would with plants.&nbsp; Keep the 6500k fluorescent right through fruiting.&nbsp; Hanging them vertically in front of a mini-greenhouse is fine.&nbsp; It's what I do when growing indoors.&nbsp; Light from the sides is just as good if not better than light from above.<br
