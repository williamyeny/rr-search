filters, one at 99.99% and one at 99.995 resulting in a 50% reduction in contaminants passing through.<br />HOWEVER, so-called hepa filters in plastic housings for home use are rated at 99.9%.&nbsp; Therefore, they'd let ten million contaminants pass through out of that billion.&nbsp; There's a huge difference between 50,000 and 10,000,000 and that only counts what slips through the filter, not what makes it around the sloppy made in china housing and gaskets.<br />I've often said my advice is never the cheapest or easiest method, but the advice I give will allow a grower to have the highest level of success possible.&nbsp; I'll never compromise on that.&nbsp; I've been in a lot of commercial spawn labs, and I've never once seen an operation with a hardware store paper filter being used for spawn generation.&nbsp; They're fine to run in your house to help filter the ambient dust and allergy spore load, but in my experience, and in the opinion of professional spawn labs, they're not suitable for mycology.<br />I have never accused anyone of lying about this-that's not my style.&nbsp; I state the facts as my own personal experience has shown.<br />RR<br /><a
