the one listed in the link above (note, i have TWO entirely different hygrometers, as shown in my picture above) the one in the ebay link, seems to be faulty somehow.&nbsp; But I don't know whats causing it, or if its just a piece of crap.</blockquote><br />It's a piece of crap, just like every thing from china.&nbsp; You can thank walmart shoppers for the fact that we can't get ANYTHING of quality any more.&nbsp; When a good analog hygrometer was $20 and made in USA, you knew what you were getting and it worked.&nbsp; When everyone went for the cheapest price no matter what, all that became available was crap from china.&nbsp; A stinking rock would probably be as accurate as that chinese toxic waste they disguise as consumer products.<br />Here's what to do.&nbsp; Toss BOTH of those so-called hygrometers in the trash and build your terrarium <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">per the tek</a> and
