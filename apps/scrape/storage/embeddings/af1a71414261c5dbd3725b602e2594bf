bad info, which then gets repeated and repeated <i>ad nauseum</i>.<br /><br />Not only did mycelium fail to evolve a urinary tract, it doesn't piss.&nbsp; Certain enzymes are secreted by the mycelium to break down food for digestion.&nbsp; This is normal.&nbsp; To call it piss means one must think it's normal to piss on his lunch before eating it.<br /><br />Another function of the mycelium secretions is as an antibiotic defense against competitor organisms.&nbsp; Common antibiotic drugs used for humans and animals are derived from mycelium.&nbsp; If you got the clap and went to your doctor asking for a shot of myc piss, he'd call the men in white suits to come pick you up.<br /><br />Let's all work to learn the proper terminology please.<br />RR","title":"Re: Yellow piss from myc
