I tried to get them for the grow I'm working on but out of stock. These are based on my own particular setup. All grown the same. For my money I would go with them again. Your mileage may vary. As a side note P.E takes more time to colonise than most at least in my experience.</blockquote><br />This is exactly why we have a sticky at the top of the page for 'strain discussion'.&nbsp; New growers soon find out that every grow is different.&nbsp; Early on, they attribute this to the name someone wrote on the print or syringe.&nbsp; Later, they realize every grow is just different because when you grow from spores, every grow is by definition a new strain.","title":"Re: Choosing a strain.
