has been settled for many years now.&nbsp; I know of zero growers who have switched to bright light in the blue spectrum of around 6500K, who have ever switched back to incandescent lights, no matter how much they bitched that light doesn't matter before trying it.<br /><br />If someone wants to do things the old way, don't argue.&nbsp; Let them do what they want.&nbsp; For some people, 'good enough' is good enough.&nbsp; Others want all the advantage they can get&nbsp; because they want to take their interests to the next level.&nbsp; This is true in any hobby or profession, including this one.&nbsp; Live and let live.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's a reason there's less than 300 commercial mushroom farms in the whole US, supplying a multi-billion dollar market.&nbsp; Those who don't learn to take every possible advantage to get the most product with the least investment, fall by the wayside and go bankrupt.&nbsp; Those who look for and take advantage of every angle, become or remain millionaires.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lighting Question
