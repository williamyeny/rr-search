said:</strong><br />You shouldn't be sealing your bags prior to PC, you might get an exploding bag someday.&nbsp; Rather, fold the gusseted ends in and pinch all the slack against the block so there is no air space, then fold the bag accordion style 3x's and either hold plastic down with rubber band or packaging tape it down but be sure to not seal it shut.&nbsp; Then place a dinner plate on top of everything to make sure bags dont pop open.&nbsp; Look at RR's video on spawn bag preparation in the sawdust/chips section of his video:<br /><a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/a204fac6-28fe-419c-aff5-c8ef245aad70.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/<wbr>a204fac6-28fe-419c-aff5-c8ef245aa<wbr>d70.aspx</a><br />I don't use impulse sealers, easiest and cheapest thing to do is get some 18gauge picture hanging wire, cut to lengths to about 6in, take the end of the bag and accordion fold it with 1\" folds from one side of the bag to the other, then twist the end tight and use the wire to twist around the twisted plastic to hold it shut.&nbsp; It makes a suprisingly good seal and you can reopen in front of hood for additions/etc.</blockquote><br />I have been preparing at least fifty bags a day like this for the past few weeks, keeping all three of my PCs busy ten to eighteen hours a day.&nbsp; It's still the tek I recommend.&nbsp; The bags vent when they need to and as the PC cools, they form a vacuum.<br />One additional thing to protect the tyvek filters on the autoclavable bags is to put a small piece of tyvek over the filter, so that it isn't pressed against the plastic, which it can stick to and be damaged when you unfold the bag.&nbsp; Since I use tyevek sleeves in each filter patch bag, I fold the part that hangs out over the filter to protect it, unless I'm using the 18\" tall bags, and with those, I have tyvek filters cut for jars, and I use one of them over each bag filter during the PC cycle.<br />We have lives, so don't trash people for not being here full time to answer your questions.&nbsp; Nobody pays us to do this, so it's best not to make anyone mad, because then they avoid your questions.<br />RR","title":"Re: Experience with vacuum sealers (esp
