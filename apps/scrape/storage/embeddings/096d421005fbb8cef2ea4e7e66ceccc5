Set one to come on at 80% to 85%(or whatever) to lock in a relay.&nbsp; Set the other one to 95% and use it to unlock the relay.&nbsp; The relay contacts would then be connected to cycle the humidifier.<br />An alternative method would be to use a time delay relay and only one humidistat. When it calls for humidity, the timer would prevent the humidifier coming on for fifteen minutes or whatever setting you use after the contacts on the humidistat close, but would shut off immediately after the humidistat set point is reached.<br />RR","title":"Re: To get a hygrotherm or not to get a hygrotherm for
