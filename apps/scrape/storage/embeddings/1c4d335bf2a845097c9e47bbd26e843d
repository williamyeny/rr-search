fans are designed to deliver large amounts of air through a duct for the purpose of supplying or exhausting air.&nbsp; The air from a vortex fan swirls through the duct just as water exits your toilet or smoke exits your chimney.<br />Such is not suitable for a laminar flow hood where you want perfectly straight airflow and static pressure behind the filter, with a very low rate of flow.&nbsp; Order a new furnace blower, or visit your local heat and air shop, and I'd venture a guess to say they have units out back in their bone yard which have been removed from customers homes when a new one was installed, and you could salvage a good blower from one of them cheaply.<br />RR","title":"Re: Will this fan work with Evilmushrooms Flowhood
