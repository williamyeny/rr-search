hate walmart and i understand that but shit.. 70 bucks for a 23 quart that will last half as long as an AA will.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Nonsense.&nbsp; Nobody has a made in china presto over 3 years old which still works.&nbsp; An AA will last a lifetime and your kids lifetime and your grandkids lifetime.&nbsp; Even if you figure you're only 30 years from dying of old age, that makes an AA a huge bargain-basement find when bought brand-new at full retail price.<br /><br />Anyone who expects volume production will need to isolate strains, or else they're starting over from spores and the associated bacteria and other contaminants each time.&nbsp; My advice is for those who want to succeed a majority of the time, not those who want to roll the dice with spores and the resulting luck of the draw each time.&nbsp; There's a huge gap between 'getting some shrooms' and getting reliable harvests time after time. <br /><br />I no longer even attempt to advise the former, but the latter.&nbsp; There's a reason Mercedes Benz doesn't sell crappy chinese cars under their own brand, and there's a reason every single member here who as tossed out his hard earned cash on a hygrometer from walmart has seen it fail to work properly for even one day.&nbsp; Walmart exists for only one reason and that's to separate you from your money on worthless shit that does not perform as advertised in order to destroy our manufacturing economy and jobs in America and Europe in favor of sending our money to a communist state with nuclear weapons pointed at your front porch.<br /><br />Besides, anyone who has the lack of class to even step one foot inside a walmart store already has no hair on his balls.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />get the PC can't go wrong Hell I got my Presto cooker in the 80's and its still all good.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />That's when Presto was still an American brand made in America.&nbsp; That isn't the case today. . .They're made in china shit and don't last beyond the warranty period.&nbsp; The price of two made in china prestos will buy you a made in America AA which will last 100 years, AND it keeps American people working in American jobs, paying American taxes to support America, not some communist state out to destroy us with help from the treasonous bastards who run walmart in order to line their own pockets with your money to invest in chalets in Switzerland.<br />RR","title":"Re: Have $500 to invest into a bulk
