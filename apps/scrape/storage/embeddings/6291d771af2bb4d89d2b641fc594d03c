consistent) <br />Then either evaporate all the way or to a set point for crystals to fall out (freeze percip)<br />Weight resulting \"crystals\" (sure they arent 100% someone on that site said 50%)<br />If you do this two times with each isolate should give a good comparison imho.</blockquote><br />PF was wrong then and still is.&nbsp; Those who attempt this waste 99% of their product or more.&nbsp; The 'crystals' are some sort of salt, but not psilocybin.&nbsp; The site has been archived so that bad info will live on in infamy.<br />RR","title":"Re: A possible method for selecting
