It has nothing to do with multiple primordia 'intertwining' into a single fruit.&nbsp; When that happens it's perfectly visible. In addition, not only strains can be cooperating together in a fruiting body, but other species as well, along with numerous species of bacteria.&nbsp; The count can be dozens or more.&nbsp; They are not all the same.<br /><br />An isolate is a single sector coherent mycelium network which will exhibit the exact same presentation every single time.&nbsp; An isolate is selected for vigorous growth, abundant fruiting, great taste, potency, etc., and all but the best are discarded.&nbsp; This culture can then be grown indefinitely.<br />RR","title":"Re: cloning and isolating...one and the
