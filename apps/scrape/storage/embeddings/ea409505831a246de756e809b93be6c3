Postal Service is broke, same reason the BIG auto companies are, there fucking employees are way overpaid and there ran by the government which by the way should not be running any kind of business...<br /></blockquote><br /><br />If you're that uneducated, why don't you take that shit to the politics forum where you'll be in good company.&nbsp; The postal service is NOT ran by the government, but they're under a mandate from Congress to deliver mail six days a week in an era where nearly all mail is done electronically by email and text messaging, bills are paid online, etc., yet they still have to keep post offices open and deliver to your damn house every day, by law.&nbsp; Their employees are not overpaid either.&nbsp; Anyone who thinks that must be a broke dick with zero education.<br /><br />The auto companies are facing competition from overseas manufacturers who do not allow US made cars into their markets to 'protect' their domestic auto industry.&nbsp; Thus, our US auto companies lose market share due to unfair trade practices by those who sell their product in the US for less than they sell them in their own countries, in order to drive our manufacturers out of business.&nbsp; If you think auto workers are over paid, it either means you are underpaid, or under educated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, no more of that anti-American crap in cultivation. <img
