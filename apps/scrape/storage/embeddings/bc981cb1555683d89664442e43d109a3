It's possible that trichoderma or some other contaminant has already taken hold of the 'uncolonized' parts, thus when the mushroom mycelium runs up against the contaminant, the natural barrier signals 'full colonization' just the same as running up against the edge of the container.<br />The second most important pinning trigger is air exchange, so if you're looking at your project a lot, this allows the CO2 to escape and be replaced by fresh air, which is a major pinning trigger as well.  If a colonizing substrate is exposed to a lot of fresh air, it will almost always begin pinning prior to full colonization.<br />A secondary pinning trigger is light, and often wrapping a substrate with foil has the opposite effect of what the grower intends.  Foil is very reflective and even small amounts of light hitting it can be reflected down into the substrate, helping to trigger pinning, especially if the other factors have been met.  If you're trying to keep the colonizing bulk sub in the dark as you should, black tape, paint or plastic is a much better choice than foil because the black absorbs the light rather than reflects it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pins before full
