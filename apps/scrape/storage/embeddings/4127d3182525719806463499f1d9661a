you referring here to removing them by hand or cutting off at the base?&nbsp; My concern was leaving large bits of mushroom stem behind, both if it would lead to contam but also if its presence would obstruct newer mushrooms growing underneath the spots.<br />I know RR said to use a knife, and he is the number one expert here it seems, its simply not what I ever would have thought would work, and even on this site, there is this quote:<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />A mushroom is best harvested by being pulled off the cased tray or cake with a twisting motion. <br />Don't use a knive or scissors, this will leave a part of the mushroom behind, which can in turn contaminate and thus prevent subsequent flushes. <br />After the mushroom is harvested, clean away any remains of vermiculite or casing that are attached to it.<br /></blockquote><br /></blockquote><br /><br />There's a tremendous amount of disinformation on this site, propagated by noobs ten years ago, and it's still there in the archives.<br /><br />I'm sick to tears of trying to correct it, so to hell with it.&nbsp; If anyone wishes to rip out large chunks of substrate, damaging the mycelium and leaving <i>substrate exposed</i> to mold, go for it.&nbsp; 'Rot' is bacteria, and any experienced grower knows bacteria is not a contaminant of the fruiting process, but only of the early spawn run process.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium, not plant matter, therefore, the stem butts left behind at harvest do not rot.<br /><br />I'd suggest to take a tour of any mushroom farm in your area.&nbsp; If you see them harvesting by ripping the fruits out, take a picture.&nbsp; I know for a fact that you'll only find them harvesting with a sharp knife, leaving the stem butts in the substrate.<br /><br />This thread gets repeated at least once a week, as if constantly bringing up outdated and bad info posted by noobs who have long since gone back to smoking crack due to constant failure at mushroom growing, is somehow going to change what should and should not be done.<br />RR","title":"Re: Vermiculite/flour ratio, and proper
