The circuits are protected with GFCI, so if any water gets on the wires themselves, it will instantly shut off the current. I do try to avoid direct spaying the CFLs, but lots of splash gets on them anyway, and I haven't broken one yet with the cold water.<br /><br />When I'm sterilizing substrates in my 55 gallon drum sterilizer every day, I have the extra steam from the exhaust vent running into the grow area to heat it up.&nbsp; That's the black pipe you see entering from the right(assuming you clicked the link).&nbsp; Inside that 2\" PVC is a 1/2\" insulated copper pipe that carries the steam.&nbsp; This heats it up to around 70F during the day, and then it naturally cools off to 50F at night due to the ground sucking the heat out.&nbsp; This is the perfect range for edibles like oysters, which I'm allergic to and can't grow any more, and shiitake, which I supply to the local stores.<br /><br />I use a combination of 6500K LED spotlights, 2 rows of 'natural daylight' LED rope lights over each shelf, and several 42 watt 6500K CFLs.&nbsp; It's nearly as bright as day in there.<br
