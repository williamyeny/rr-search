After all, think of the weight(pressure) a 10,000 feet deep well of water will exert on the water at the bottom.  That's a lot more pressure then the walls of our PC's can contain.  <br />However, I doubt seriously the walls of an oven bag can exert that much pressure.  There's no way to get every molecule of air out of a bag of coir or manure, even if it soaks in water for a month.  In addition, even if it did, you'd be handling a bomb when you open the microwave.<br />My background is engineering, not chemistry, so we should wait for one of the member chemists to chime in.  The overall point is mute though, because sterilized substrates are much more likely to contaminate than pasteurized substrates.  One shouldn't heat substrate or casing material above about 170F, or the chances of contamination are increased rather than decreased.<br />RR","title":"Re: Super Sterilization
