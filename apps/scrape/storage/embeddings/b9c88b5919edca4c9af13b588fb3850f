Only thing about light that matters is the blue 6500k color, and lumens hardly matter. The difference between 1000 lumens and 2000 lumens is negligible.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />This is the kind of bad info that gets vomited out time after time around here.<br /><br />Intensity matters a great deal.&nbsp; That's why outdoor cubes are often several times larger than we grow indoors.&nbsp; However, lumens isn't a measure of light intensity, so we use lux which is one lumen spread over one square meter.<br /><br />Nobody can give a lux figure for best performance because other factors come into play such as the beam angle and the amount of light reflected or absorbed by the terrarium.<br /><br />6500K is also not a wavelength, bandwidth, frequency, etc., of light.&nbsp; It's only a rough guide on the <i>combined color</i> the light appears to our eyes or our camera lens.<br /><br />To the OP, just experiment to find the best performance at a price you can afford.&nbsp; Bright is better so disregard those who would say mushrooms don't photosynthesize therefore don't need bright light.&nbsp; That's akin to saying a diesel truck can't drive down the road because it doesn't burn gasoline.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many lumens do I need in colonization,
