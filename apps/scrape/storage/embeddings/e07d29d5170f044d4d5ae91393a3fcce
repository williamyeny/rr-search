often falling over when mature on their own.&nbsp; With these you can twist and pull without causing any damage to the cake or other bulk substrate, so go ahead and do so.&nbsp; Other strains have fruits which are deeply attached and if you twist and pull these, you rip out a chunk of substrate.&nbsp; In these cases, always cut the fruit off at the base and leave the stump.&nbsp; It will not rot, contrary to constant ranting by inexperienced growers that it will.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cutting at the base vs. twist n pull
