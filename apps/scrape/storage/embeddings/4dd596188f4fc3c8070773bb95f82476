However, it isn't always necessary.  If you'll mix the hydrated garden lime as directed above, you'll be fine.  Anything above neutral and below 8.5 will be cool.  I shoot for 8.   Most of the probe type ph meters I've used have been crap.  They consist of two dissimilar metals with an insulator between.  The meter itself is a voltage meter, and the acidity of the soil makes the dissimilar metals function as a battery, making the volt meter swing either to the positive or negative depending on whether the soil is acid or sweet.  The problem is, different soil textures will effect the probes in different ways. Sandy soil has a lot of contact with the probes, while a loose casing material has much less contact.  That's why I prefer paper, or you can go to a garden center and get a soil test kit. Even the cheapie test kits have a ph test.  Just follow instructions on the box.<br />RR","title":"Re: Garden Lime = More Acid No
