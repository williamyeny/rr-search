That whole section of the shroomery is horribly outdated and inaccurate, and should have been deleted years ago as it's a byproduct of when the site was new and there were few or no good procedures for growing mushrooms in small amounts at home. We also know that putting a garden hose on a cool mist humidifier causes static pressure to build, which forces moisture into the bushings, ruining them.<br />If you're trying to grow mushrooms in a terrarium, simply use a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> and your humidity WILL be in the mid to upper 90s, and you'll have the proper amount of fresh air exchange, not 'gas' exchange as it's called in that outdated procedure.<br />By the way, the word is hygrometer and you need a high quality mechanical one, preferably one which uses a human hair to detect moisture content in the air.&nbsp; A hydrometer is used to measure specific gravity, something we don't need for mushroom cultivation.<br />RR","title":"Re: 80% Humidity with Shroomgods Humidifier
