millet, etc.&nbsp; They're used to expand mycelium.&nbsp; Brown rice flour mixed with verm is a cross-over material, being effective as a spawn and also as a substrate.&nbsp; The others require a casing layer to be used effectively as a substrate.<br /><br />A substrate is the fruiting media.&nbsp; As said above, you can case your spawn with peat/verm or potting soil and get fruits.&nbsp; Otherwise, the best course of action is to use the colonized spawn to inoculate a bulk substrate such as horse manure, coir, straw, compost, etc.<br /><br />Vermiculite makes an 'OK' bulk substrate material when mixed with grains.&nbsp; Verm has minerals and other food fungi love and they fruit pretty well on it.&nbsp; However, vermiculite works better when used to 'fluff up' a bulk substrate such as bagged-up composted cow manure from a nursery or compost, by mixing it 50/50 with the other material.&nbsp; In years past, there was a lot of horrible information posted on this and other boards saying verm has no 'nutes', which is flat-out wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don't try to inoculate verm or any other bulk substrate indoors with spores or liquid culture.&nbsp; It has a 99% chance of failure.&nbsp; Use the spores to colonize a spawn media, and when that's fully colonized, use those grains or brf to inoculate the verm or other bulk substrate material.&nbsp; Hopefully, this clears up any confusion over the difference between the two.<br /><br />To the original poster, you can get horse manure in NYC.&nbsp; In every city I've been to, there's always an area with people who own horses, and in addition, most large cities have a mounted police force.&nbsp; Don't be shy about knocking on a door where you see horses, or walking right up to the police department stables with a bag and shovel and asking for manure for your garden.&nbsp; They'll be glad to let you have it.&nbsp; Collect field aged manure that's been out in the pasture in the sun for a few weeks, not the urine soaked stuff they sweep out of the barns.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pros and cons of substrates: wbs, brf & verm mix, rye berries,
