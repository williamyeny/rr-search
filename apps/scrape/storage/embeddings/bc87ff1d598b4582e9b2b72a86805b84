insulated glass jar.<br />Also, if you tried to grow indoors at 100F, you'd have a much better chance of growing mold.&nbsp; Outdoors, there's a balance of nature so it works fine.<br />For those of you getting tired of the heat, I'll rub it in a little.&nbsp; We've yet to hit 80F so far this spring, and the day before yesterday, we finally let the fire in the wood stove go out.&nbsp; Today, the high was only 60F, which is perfect for the hiking and mountain climbing I try to do a few times a week.&nbsp; I could never go back to living in a hot climate. <img
