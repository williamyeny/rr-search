It flies in the face of RR's own research into the hybridization of strains. PE6 for example is a cube strain <b>created by Roger by crossing two other strains.</b> </blockquote><br />Getting personal isn't going to make your point.&nbsp; I've repeatedly said PE is its own animal.&nbsp; A cross with PE and any other genetics is going to be visible.<br />Now for some history:&nbsp; Several years ago, before any of you posting in this thread had even registered here, we didn't have a strain thread.&nbsp; Somewhere between 25% and 50% of the new threads were people arguing over 'strains', or asking which strain is best, etc., with everyone jumping in to the thread to repeat the same bullshit over and over again, getting personal and attacking others, just like in this thread.&nbsp; There would then be fifty or more active <i>strain threads</i> in cultivation, far more than threads that were asking about things that actually mattered such as FAE, lighting, substrate composition, etc.<br />To the new growers, they saw all these strain threads, and immediately thought strain must be the most important factor, so they all rushed out to buy the latest 'fad strain' that everyone was talking about.&nbsp; They then put it in a totally sealed up terrarium, wouldn't mist because 'misting kills pins', even going so far as to build 'drip shields' per PF, because any water touching a mushroom would kill it.&nbsp; They colonized at 86F in total darkness, losing over half their jars to molds and bacteria due to high temperature.&nbsp; They placed these sealed up terrariums in a far corner of the room because 'any old light will do' and got absolutely ecstatic if they got 3 grams off a pf cake.<br />Today, people understand the importance of FAE, light, misting, etc., and they get ten or more dry grams from the same sized cake.&nbsp; They colonize jars at room temperature while exposed to ambient light, and think far less about the name someone wrote on the print, and more on the conditions that actually matter.&nbsp; The difference?&nbsp; We don't have half the threads in cultivation discussing some worthless facet of cultivation, and instead people are asking questions about things that actually do matter.<br />That's why strain discussion was banished to its own thread.&nbsp; The emotion and pseudo-flaming taking place in this thread and in the other current one on embossed spore prints shows that the physics of fungi are still not well understood, and those who are jumping up and down screaming for things to go their own way, seem to understand the least.&nbsp; This thread confirms that after five years of banishment, the strain thread needs to stay right where it is.<br />RR","title":"Re: Suggestion for mush
