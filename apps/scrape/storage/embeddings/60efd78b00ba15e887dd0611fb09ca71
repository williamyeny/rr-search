almost no resistance, that would be OK.&nbsp; Most filters are rated at 1\" WG, and that one was something like .2 inches, which I doubted would give laminar flow.&nbsp; Just get a speed controller and adjust it so it bends the flame of a bic lighter over 45 to 90 degrees, but doesn't flicker or blow it out and you'll be fine.&nbsp; What you're looking for is 100 to 150 feet per minute of flow coming out the front of the filter.&nbsp; For a 4 square foot filter, that would be 400 to 600 CFM, depending on static pressure.&nbsp; It's kind of hard to calculate when you don't know the capacity of the blower you ordered.&nbsp; Hopefully, it will do the trick.&nbsp; 800 CFM with no static pressure rating doesn't really tell you much.&nbsp; A car with a blown engine can still go 70 mph down hill.<br />RR","title":"Re: Blower/Filter question for
