still need to calibrate it on a regular basis.<br />However, in reality, once you learn what it takes to maintain upper 90% humidity levels, you can just keep on doing that and not worry too much about it.&nbsp; If you can get that unit for half price, great.&nbsp; If not, you can probably get a $20 analog, calibrate it and see what it takes to get near saturation humidity with lots of air exchange at the same time.&nbsp; Once you get that figured out, you're good to go.<br />RR","title":"Re: certified hygrometer, worth
