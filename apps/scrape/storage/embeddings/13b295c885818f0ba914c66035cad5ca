The hoods that Paul Stamets sells at fungi perfecti are sadly NOT laminar flow hoods.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, they are laminar flow. I've tested mine with an anemometer. <br /><br />An enclosure in front of the hood creates drag, which causes eddy currents, disrupting the laminar flow.&nbsp; I'm not saying having an enclosure is a <i>sure failure</i>, but it's certainly not necessary and will interfere with laminar flow due to drag.<br /><br />Laminar flow means you have the same velocity over the entire surface.&nbsp; I have a laminar wing on my aerobatic airplane, meaning it has the same shape over the entire surface, resulting in the same airflow over the whole surface.&nbsp; The whole wing will stall at the same time, rather than a 'family sedan' type airfoil which will stall at the root, allowing an inexperienced pilot to still have aileron control during a stall.<br /><br />I've been using the PF model below for over a decade now with 100% success, even though my lab is also a bedroom with carpeting where I sleep with my dog(who rolls in bear and/or cougar scat every time she sees a pile) curled up at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I just let the flowhood run for an hour or two before beginning work and it scrubs the air clean.&nbsp; Nobody can argue with 100% success, and the pre-filter is just duct taped on.&nbsp; Sure, it's ghetto, but it works and works very well.<br /><br />While a large filter might be nice and give more room to work, it's not entirely necessary and by all means, an enclosure in front of the filter which restricts working space is not necessary.&nbsp; I often lift the bottom of jars and spawn bags above the flow area, while keeping the opening well within the sterile flow.<br
