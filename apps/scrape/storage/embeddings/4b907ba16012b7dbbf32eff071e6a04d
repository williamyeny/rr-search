You can actually see  individual spores at 40X.<br />There's two main types of microscopes that are useful for mycology, the light microscope, and the stereo microscope, with or without zoom capability.  Light microscopes let you see the light that <i><u>shines through</u></i> the object.  Stereo microscopes let you see the light that <i><u>reflects off</u></i> the object, much the way we see things in real life.  I use my stereo microscopes ten times as often as I use the light microscopes.<br />Power is actually a minor consideration with light microscopes as long as they can go to 400X, which is enough to see the internal components, including nucleus of the spore.(provided it comes with a condenser to focus the light)  The size of the objective and eyepiece lenses makes much more difference and should be the major consideration.  The stereo zoom microscope I use most often tops out at 50X but has a 2\" diameter objective lense that lets in a LOT of light.  For identification of mycelium vs contaminants, or studying anything growing on a petri dish, that's the scope I use.<br />Cheap microscopes have small lenses and objectives that hardly let in any light, so are worthless at the higher powers.  If you try to make up for it with brighter light, you cook your specimen.<br />RR","title":"Re: Where to buy a nice
