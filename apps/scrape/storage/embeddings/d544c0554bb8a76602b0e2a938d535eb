alt=\":heart:\" title=\":heart:\"/> </blockquote><br />No, I'm not incorrect.&nbsp; After describing how to make peat based casings without pasteurization, he says as an after thought in the last paragraph that if you use use SOIL as a casing layer, that you CAN pasteurize it.&nbsp; Paul was talking about using a shovelful of dirt from the backyard.&nbsp; Peat based casings are recommended(by him) to be unpasteurized.<br />I've done it both ways, and I hesitate to recommend one way or the other for cubes because it makes such little difference.&nbsp; As said, a properly made casing layer will increase pinsets and yields.&nbsp; However, with a soak(I hate the word 'dunk') and a sheet of wax paper over the uncased substrate, pinsets and yields can come close to or equal a casing layer covered substrate.<br />My main point about sterilizing casing layers is that one, it makes them more prone to contamination, not less.&nbsp; A sterilized substrate is prime food for whatever organism is the first to land on it.&nbsp; Second, many gourmet species will not fruit on a pasteurized or sterilized substrate/casing.&nbsp; Eventually, most growers either move from cubes to more difficult species to grow, or they lose interest in the hobby and quit growing.&nbsp; I just feel it's important to learn procedures that you can use later.&nbsp; I hope this clears it up.<br />RR","title":"Re:
