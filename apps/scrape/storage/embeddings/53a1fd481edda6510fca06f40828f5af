above.&nbsp; Granular gypsum has a binding agent to make it form into pellets.&nbsp; This binding agent is what you are trying to dissolve in water.&nbsp; When I talk about dissolving the gypsum, I'm talking about the binding agent and don't feel compelled to type the long-version over and over again, so I simply say 'gypsum'.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />if the gypsum is only to coat the outside of the grains then everybody that is adding gypsum to their grains/wbs and then washing the grains after the soak is doing themselves a disservice </blockquote><br />I've never said gypsum is 'only' to coat the outside of the grains.&nbsp; Don't assume that minerals have only one purpose.&nbsp; In addition, I've typed dozens of times to NOT rinse the grains after the soak.<br />If there's things you don't understand, simply ask, but we can do without the attitude.<br />Gypsum can provide up to a 25% increase in harvest weight over not using it in bulk substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Has
