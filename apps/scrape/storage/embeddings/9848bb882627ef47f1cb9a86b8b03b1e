{"key":"embedding-6770311","value":{"id":6770311,"first":6755337,"last":6770311,"when":1176234345,"utime":"04/10/07 10:45 PM","content":"You want large objective and eyepieces.  Both are important.  I estimated a 2\" objective by putting a tape measure across it.  That's pretty close.  If you want to be able to see the cystidia on gills, you better not get the .5 objective.<br />Scroll through my gallery, and you'll see some closeup pictures of mushroom gills that were taken with minimum magnification of .6 for a total of 6X.  At the maximum, you can just start to see the basidia, but you'll need the LED ring or better yet, the fiber optic light because very little light makes it through the objective at maximum zoom.<br />Yes, mine is the SZ300 with flexible boom stand, with the LED light ring shown, or perhaps the later version of it since the color is different. The package cost about $1400, but I already had the CCD tube for my camera.  The CCD tube and camera cost about double the cost of the scope, but I can move the tube and camera from scope to scope if I need to use my light microscope.  I use the 3 megapixel CCD camera from that site as well to take pictures, but bear in mind, they had to be reduced to upload here.  At home, the micrographs are larger than desktop size and quite detailed.<br />Perhaps the best bet is to give Jeff a call on the phone at the number listed.  He'll answer your questions about the features better than I can, and can suggest lower cost alternatives if you don't need to be taking high resolution pictures. I also have one of those eyepiece cameras he sells on the front page of that site.  Resolution is much lower, but it does take color pictures.  Just don't get talked into halogen lighting, because it's pretty useless for mycology, as said earlier.<br />RR","title":"Re: Choosing between Stereo
