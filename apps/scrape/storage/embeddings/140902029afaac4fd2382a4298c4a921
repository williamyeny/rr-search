for your blower in a perfect world, that one might be fine.&nbsp; However, we live in an imperfect world, and there's going to be resistance in the housing, and more resistance as the airflow turns the corner in the plenum behind the filter, etc.,&nbsp; I'd look for one that delivers around 500 cfm @ .9\" - 1\" of WC.<br />Once you get it all put together, you want the stream to bend the flame of a bic lighter over 45 to 90 degrees, but not blow it out.&nbsp; If it blows too hard, you can either get a $50 motor speed controller to slow it down, or simply block off part of the intake air supply to choke it down.<br />The cancer risk is probably the varnish insulation on the windings or something like that, so don't eat or suck on your blower motor.<br />I gave some detailed info on hooking up graingers motors to another member a few months ago.&nbsp; Search posts using my name and the terms: white wire, green, black, chassis, and you should find it easily.&nbsp; If in doubt, take it to an electrical, or heating and air conditioning shop and they'll wire it up safely to a cord and plug for you.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flowhood Build help with blower
