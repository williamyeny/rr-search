/><b>glad to offer the info,<br />LED , is the choice for the advanced grow.<br />affordable, durable, versatile, effective.<br /></b><br /></blockquote><br /><br />LEDs have shortfalls in spectrum, and their performance is not quite ready for prime time.&nbsp; When I built the mushroom farm you linked to in the seedstock article, I used LEDs exclusively.&nbsp; However, it's become apparent over the years that fluorescent lamps around 6500K are the best choice, not LEDs or especially 'blue' LEDs.&nbsp; I've since removed the LEDs from the farm and all 500 feet of LED light rope is currently coiled up on a pile of straw bales in my barn.<br /><br />It appears you don't understand the difference between blue light and light in the <i>blue spectrum</i>, which actually appears mostly white to our eyes.&nbsp; The latter is what we want, and the weight of finished product grown under proper lighting will be double or more the weight of a grow only illuminated for a few minutes a day or even all day with the wrong spectrum.&nbsp; This is apparent from pictures above from a grow with insufficient lighting.&nbsp; You can see plenty of mushrooms(they'll pin and grow in total darkness) but they're small and the caps are thin.&nbsp; Contrast that to monsters with double or even triple the weight when grown with good full-spectrum lighting.<br /><br /><a
