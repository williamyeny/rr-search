{"key":"embedding-5646573","value":{"id":5646573,"first":5645597,"last":5651027,"when":1147984956,"utime":"05/18/06 11:42 PM","content":"The quote above from TMC is outdated and incorrect.  The mycelium does exude the metabolytes, which is probably not the best term for them either.  20+ years ago when Paul wrote TMC, he was using the most accurate information he had at the time.  That information has changed, and his latest work reflects that, as well as the work of lots of other researchers in the field.<br />I recently drained about an inch of metabolyte from a colonized jar of rye that was left for several months at a high temperature specifically to produce metabolytes.  The metabolytes were placed on a petri dish that had been purposely inoculated with bacteria, so that the metabolytes covered the bacteria.   After 36 hours, the bacteria was dead, and mycelial fibers that exist within the metabolytes had begun to grow.  Within 10 days the entire dish was colonized with healthy mycelium.<br />Definitely the presence of bacteria in cultures causes an increase in metabolyte production.  The International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms has some interesting articles on this, but so far they've ignored my requests for permission to post the articles online, so I haven't.  I did listen to several speakers at the medicinal mushroom conference last October who are doing research using the metabolytes not only to control contaminants in commercial operations, but as an anti-viral and anti-microbial drug for animals, and soon for humans.<br />I think as we learn more, we'll find they are not a waste product at all as paul wrote in tmc, but rather medicine being produced by the mycelium itself.<br />I also make no attempt to soak up the metabolytes when applying a casing layer.  The peat/verm soaks it up, and it then spreads out in the casing layer, offering protection. Ever see a spore germinate or bacteria reproduce in the presence of ethanol and acetone?  They can't.  However, you can see from the microscope pictures below, mycelium colonizes and grows within the secretions themselves. I fail to see how this crystal clear liquid with mycelial fibers growing within could be confused with urination. So far, I've never observed a bladder in mushroom mycelium.  Please don't call it 'piss', because that's an inaccurate analogy and it confuses people.  <br />I can't wait to learn more.  This is a field of study that is wide open.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380084-Metabolite_5.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return
