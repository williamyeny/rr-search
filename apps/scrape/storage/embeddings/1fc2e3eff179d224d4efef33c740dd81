We started construction almost exactly this time last year, and stopped on Nov 4 when winter closed in hard.&nbsp; We'll be doing the landscaping and finishing the retaining rock wall/entrance as soon as the snow melts in mid May. <br /><br />We've got nearly 3,000 shiitake blocks inside it right now.&nbsp; First harvests came out about a month ago.&nbsp; We expect to be at full speed by June or July, with 40 to 60 pounds per day coming out.&nbsp; I sell to the local grocery stores for $5/pound, which is a steal for them, but because our costs are almost nil besides our own labor, it's making us a living and we get to stay home at our cabin in the mountains with plenty of time for hiking and fishing. <br />RR","title":"Re: How do agricultural farmers grow
