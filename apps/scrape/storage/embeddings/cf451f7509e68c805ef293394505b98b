No soaks, no boils, nothing.<br />Anno, Prisoner, agar all posted they go bareback in the PC. <br />So why do heavyweights like RR still maintain a 4-24 hour soak followed by a boil?</blockquote><br />You'll notice those threads are all nearly 8 years old, and were from before \"Let's Grow Mushrooms\" was released.&nbsp; They were following TMC, the only guide at the time.<br />We've learned a lot since then, and the rinse, soak, boil method is the industry standard these days.&nbsp; Our <a href=\"http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">commercial mushroom farm</a> produces hundreds of pounds of rye spawn per month and we do it exactly as shown in the video.&nbsp; If you look at the commercial spawn labs, they also follow that technique.&nbsp; Nobody mixes water and grains and then cooks them.&nbsp; If you have super fast colonization, I can nearly guarantee you're growing mold.<br />Also note, <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Let's Grow Mushrooms</a> does not recommend 'simmering'.&nbsp; I use a <b>rapid boil</b>, followed by drying the grains.&nbsp; This results in the perfect moisture content, and the best chance of success.&nbsp; It doesn't mean other methods are sure-fail, but that the soak, boil, dry method gives the best success rate, bar none.&nbsp; We wouldn't do it hundreds of times per month if it didn't give us the highest success rate.&nbsp; In our operation selling mushrooms to grocery stores at only $6/pound wholesale, a 1% fail rate means the difference between making a profit and going hungry.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why do people still soak and boil rye these
