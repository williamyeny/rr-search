The highest pressure on the planet occurs in the polar regions during the winter when the air is very cold, not in the equatorial regions during summer when the sun is heating the air to very high temperatures.<br />The shotgun terrarium is a miniature weather system.&nbsp; The cooler air within the damp perlite is slightly more dense than the warmer air above, causing air to flow upward towards lower pressure, regardless of temperature.&nbsp; This airflow results in evaporative cooling within the perlite, perpetuating the flow as long as the air above is at a slightly lower pressure.<br />I can't make it any easier to understand than that.&nbsp; The important thing is not to make the mistake of thinking hot air rising is the driving force in weather patterns.&nbsp; Pressure gradients are the driving force in weather.&nbsp; The other mistake you're making is assuming that heating the air results in a higher pressure.&nbsp; The opposite is actually true, warm air is less dense, thus at a lower pressure.&nbsp; <br />The reason a hot air balloon floats is not because hot air rises.&nbsp; The burner controlled by the balloon pilot is only a means to an end...The heat forces the molecules of air in the balloon apart, causing there to be fewer of them in the envelope, thus it's at lower density(weight) and rises.<br />24/7 light is harmful to fungi and degrades performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun Fruiting Chamber
