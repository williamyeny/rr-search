Still other growers get multiple flushes from them, but with the isolated fruiting strains I use, I consider them a one flush wonder.<br /><br />Feel free to experiment all you want.&nbsp; Consider what you learn here or in the DVD to be a starting point, and then take it from there.<br />RR","title":"Re: Straw Log
