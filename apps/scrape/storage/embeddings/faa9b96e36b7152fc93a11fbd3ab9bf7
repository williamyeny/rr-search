The increased fresh air, with the corresponding drop in CO2 levels sends the mycelium that message.<br />Light is also NOT just to establish the direction the fruits grow.  In fact, air currents have a greater effect on direction of growth than light.  If you doubt this, place a fan on your crop and watch.<br />A few seconds of light per day will NOT help to generate a good pinset.  In fact, light is a secondary pinning trigger, but an important one.  The difference between three or four pins, and hundreds of pins on a substrate can be directly correlated to the length, intensity, and frequency of the light applied, provided the primary pinning triggers have been fulfilled.<br />The light needs to be intense enough to penetrate 1/2\" into the substrate.  Not all pins form on the surface.  Many originate from deeper in the substrate or casing layer.<br />Higher frequency light above a color temperature of 5,000 Kelvin will generate far more pins than a 'red' source of light such as incandescent lamps.<br />Fungi is a living organism that is much more closely related to mammals such as humans, than to plants.  People need to quit looking at mycelium as a different kind of plant, which it isn't.  Mycelium has been shown to have circadian rhythms just like mammals, and this is the reason that 12/12 light cycles work best.  This planet, and all surface life on it are based on the 24 hour day.  For best results, learn to work with nature rather than against it.  Mycelium has an amazing ability to cope with less than optimal conditions, and will often fruit when a grower does everything wrong.  However, do everything right and watch your performance go through the roof.<br />RR","title":"Re: 12/12
