Having a lower BE in such a case doesn't make the bulk sub grow lesser, since it's almost just a circumstantial number.&nbsp; It's lower because a dry substrate material is used to apply necessary water.<br />This is why I prefer to focus on the grains alone when calculating BE for grows like these.&nbsp; It makes the number applicable and meaningful at face value.</blockquote><br />This is flat-out wrong.&nbsp; First of all, wtf is A-tek?&nbsp; I've never heard of it.&nbsp; Teks should be named after what they do.&nbsp; We don't use 'A' for anything so don't need a tek for it.<br />Secondly, bulk substrates supply food for the mycelium.&nbsp;  They are not used to 'apply water'.&nbsp; The casing layer you're putting over grains serves that purpose, but you're conveniently leaving that out of BE calculations, skewing the number in favor of straight grains.<br />Third, you're also wrong about bulk substrates always having a lower BE.&nbsp; I've seen straw deliver over 1000% BE, with 500% being average.&nbsp; On the cover of my DVD is a first flush of over 10 pounds of mushrooms from less than one pound of straw.&nbsp; That basket fruited again and again for several months.<br />To claim in earlier posts that cased grains are higher potency than bulk substrates is over the top.&nbsp; The mycelium doesn't lose its vigor or potency when it's given a larger, more diverse substrate.&nbsp; If you doubt this, try to eat only one food item for a few months and see how you feel.<br />You talked above about the energy costs to pasteurize bulk substrates.&nbsp; This cost pales in comparison to the cost of sterilizing grains at a much higher temperature, which is considerably more expensive and time consuming.&nbsp; If it was not, commercial farms would all be using cased grains, since these procedures have been around for decades.<br />The bottom line is cased grains are fine and perform well.&nbsp; Bulk substrates are fine and perform well.&nbsp; BRF tek is fine and performs well. Each grower has a different set of conditions to deal with, so there are procedures to fit various circumstances.&nbsp; None are 'better' than any other.&nbsp; If I tried to run my shiitake farm on cased grains, I'd have gone bankrupt by now.<br />RR","title":"Re: A culture comparison log - Watered cased grass seed
