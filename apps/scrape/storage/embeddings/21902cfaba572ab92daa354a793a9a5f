I've seen damp bags of pure vermiculite with cobweb mold covering the entire surface.<br /><br />By baking the verm before use, you kill off the billions of unwanted fungi and other contaminants which have settled on it since it left the furnaces at the manufacturing plant.&nbsp; Of course, whatever lands on the verm after baking and before harvest will have a chance to grow, but the idea is to reduce the spore load before using so the mushroom mycelium has a window of opportunity to fruit before trichoderma or other molds take hold of the damp verm and grow instead.<br />RR","title":"Re:
