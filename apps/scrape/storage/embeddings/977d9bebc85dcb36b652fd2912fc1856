enough agar, your plates will dry out.&nbsp; If you use too much, there isn't room for the mycelium to grow without pressing against the top of the cover.&nbsp; I use 600 ml for 20 dishes.<br />I'd suggest using the pre-sterilized plastic dishes and pour all twenty at once.&nbsp; After pouring, slip them back into the sleeve they came packaged in.&nbsp; Once you inoculate, wrap with parafilm and put each dish in a ziplock sandwich bag.&nbsp; Un-inoculated petri dishes in the original sleeve should last a month or more and still be good to use.&nbsp;  Remember, once you inoculate a dish, you want to transfer healthy mycelium to a fresh dish as soon as you ID it.&nbsp; This way, you stay one step ahead of any contaminants that pop up.&nbsp; When you have a clean culture, use it to inoculate grains, but before you do, make a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Master-Culture-Slants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">master culture slant</a> so you don't
