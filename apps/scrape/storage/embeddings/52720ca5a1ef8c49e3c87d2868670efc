/>First, mycelium on the cap does not indicate high humidity.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium, so with improper fresh air exchange, mycelium other than <i>tertiary</i> mycelium often grows on the caps and stems.&nbsp; It isn't related to humidity, but to fresh air exchange.<br /><br />Second, that isn't a cracked cap, but a <i>split</i> cap.&nbsp; There's a major difference.&nbsp; Cracked caps(scaling) is caused by low humidity, and looks like a reptile skin.&nbsp; What you have is a split cap, which simply indicates rapid growth.<br />RR","title":"Re: One for the experts: A
