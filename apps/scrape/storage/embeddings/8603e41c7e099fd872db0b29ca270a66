Terrariums are suitable for cakes and small cased or uncased substrates.<br /><br />A 12 quart casing would have to be laid on top of a 100 quart substrate, so that's something for a greenhouse, and a large one at that.  That's commercial sized growing, not practical in a terrarium anyway.<br /><br />Here's how I build terrariums.  After drilling holes in all six sides, three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite is added to the bottom.  This maintains upper 90 percent humidity, and provides enough air exchange to allow you to go to work and leave it without fanning until you get home, provided it's in an open room, not a closed up closet.  Stale, still air is the biggest cause of contaminants in mushroom growing.  Good luck.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\"
