want.&nbsp; Disregard bad advice to the contrary.&nbsp; If your grow is not going as planned, it's not due to the fine verm.&nbsp; If you think fine verm compacts, try stepping on your bag and see if it does-it does not.&nbsp; If you make brf cakes with the course verm, they'll be too wet due to course verm not holding enough water, and in addition, it's totally useless for the filter.<br /><br
