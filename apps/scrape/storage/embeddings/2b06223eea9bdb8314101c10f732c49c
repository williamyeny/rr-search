hostility.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I just read this whole thread looking for that hostility and didn't find it. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/>&nbsp; Perhaps you could point me to it, and I'll do something.&nbsp; I've tried to advise based on what works fastest and with the least amount of contamination.&nbsp; The myceliated water from a jar of grains injected with sterile water is not really LC, since you're not growing the mycelium in liquid media.&nbsp; That's why I've always tried to call it <i>myceliated water</i>, since the water is simply the carrier.<br /><br />I've used LC and have an eberbach, a magnetic stir plate(five or six of them) and a couple of laminar flow hoods.&nbsp; I <i>still</i> find that grain to grain transfers are faster and have less chance of failure.<br /><br />My concern is new growers squirting spores into sugar water, and then a month later injecting that into their cakes and ruining them, thus they've lost two months and have nothing to show.&nbsp; They often quit at that time, as can be seen from the hundreds who register here every month, fail and then quit.&nbsp; Helping them achieve success on their first grow is what I'm trying to do here.&nbsp; Hopefully, that's not where you're perceiving the hostility.<br /><br />As for my underground mushroom cave, it's still under construction and not operational yet.&nbsp; Here's a pic from yesterday.&nbsp; I'm laying natural rock on the inside, and similar but larger rocks will cover the entrance, giving the look and ambiance of a real cave.&nbsp; The rocks you see will go all the way to the ceiling in a few places, and will also be laid down on the entire floor.&nbsp; I can only lay about 24\" in a day, and then have to let the mortar cure before adding more rocks, to avoid collapse.&nbsp; The rock has all been gathered either from my own property or adjoining land in the forest.&nbsp; I have 20 pickup loads stacked up outside so far.<br />RR<br /><br /><a
