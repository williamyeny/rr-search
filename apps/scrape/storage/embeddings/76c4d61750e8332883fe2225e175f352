They do not compete for 'nutes', they don't make small fruits, they don't disrupt each others networks, and they don't get cut off from their own network. I speak from experience.  Use the search feature and you'll see this issue comes up every couple of months at least, and this same disinformation gets repeated over and over again by those who have never done it.<br />Here's a post I made in a similar thread several months ago with a picture showing two different strains fusing by anastomosis to create a third strain on a petri dish. <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/5545843#Post5545843\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/5545843#Post5545843</a> Cubensis is easy to cross. Some mycologists use the term hybrid, but I prefer 'cross', instead using the term hybrid to refer to cross-species matings.<br />Every single multispore inoculation results in hundreds of 'strains'.  Where is this fighting?  Remember, a strain is born when two compatible hyphae exchange genetic information to become dikaryotic.  It doesn't matter one whit whether the spores those hyphae came from originated from the same sporeprint, or sporeprints from the opposite sides of the world.  Vendor named strains are just that-names.  If the species is cubensis, they will combine normally. That is a fact.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mixing different strains/jars of
