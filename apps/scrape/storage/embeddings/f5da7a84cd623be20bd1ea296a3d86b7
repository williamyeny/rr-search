Without chlorophyll (which absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer) its simply not possible.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I don't think you fully thought that statement out.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's important to keep open minds.&nbsp; Mycelium is as different from plants as we are, and much less studied than either one.&nbsp; After more than 35 years of growing mushrooms both privately and commercially, I beg to disagree that light is just a pinning trigger.&nbsp; If you doubt this, run lights until you get a pinset, and then shut them off.&nbsp; The fruits will be small and under-formed compared to a control group exposed to light the whole time.&nbsp; That has all the hallmarks of deriving energy from the light.<br /><br />At the very least, it's impossible to prove they are <i>not</i> deriving energy from light, and since we know yields will be better with proper lighting from start to finish, there's no sense arguing over semantics.<br /><br />I've ran many tests over the years with lights measured in wavelength, but have found from experience that the color temperature scale is very useful for our purposes.&nbsp; Growers who have switched to +/- 6500 Kelvin fluorescent lighting have never come in and said it made no difference.&nbsp; They've all reported better results than they had previously achieved.<br />RR","title":"Re:
