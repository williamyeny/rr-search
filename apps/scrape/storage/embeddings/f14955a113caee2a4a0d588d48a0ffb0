Use it at full strength. It comes pre diluted. If you want a super disinfectant <br />spray the surface with vinegar, then H2O2, but don't mix the two in the same bottle.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It's important to remember that not everyone is in the US where peroxide is sold in brown bottles at 3%.&nbsp; It's much stronger in some countries.<br /><br />As for the salad thing, it's a mistake to assume that killing every organism on food is a good thing.&nbsp; We want to get rid of e coli and like, but not everything.&nbsp; We don't live in a sterile world.&nbsp; I doubt that peroxide and vinegar would get rid of pesticide residue, but washing does, and I know that running water will remove e coli and salmonella bacteria from food.&nbsp; As for killing 100,000 organisms, bear in mind we have more bacteria cells in our bodies than human cells.<br /><br />To the OP, use peroxide to control cobweb mold, but it has little other benefit.&nbsp; Some use it as a surface disinfectant, but for sterile work, I prefer to wash my glass table top and surgical gloves with alcohol and/or Lysol.&nbsp; Never spray peroxide on mycelium without a darn good reason.&nbsp; It shocks the mycelium, setting it back and leaving an opening for competitors.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions on the use of Hydrogen
