It takes less time to mix up a batch of brf than it does to mix up a batch of brownies.&nbsp; If that's like driving 500 miles to work minimum wage, then just consider the source.<br /><br />If you're trying to grow many pounds of mushrooms, the brf tek isn't the way to do it, because bulk growing in trays of manure or straw will produce more mushrooms per square feet of growing area in your available space.<br /><br />However, if you're growing for personal use, there is <i>no faster method</i> to go from spore syringe to harvested fruits than the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf/pf tek</a>.&nbsp; For advanced users who have been doing <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Strain-Isolation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">strain isolation</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Agar-Petri-Dishes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">petri dishes on agar</a>, the brf tek is the quickest method to prove the strains you've isolated to pick out the best performers.&nbsp; Once that is done, you can inoculate <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">grains</a>, do a series of <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-to-Grain-Transfers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">grain to grain transfers</a>, and grow thousands of pounds on bulk substrates such as <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Horse-Manure-Substrate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">manure</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Straw-Projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">straw</a> within a few months, which you couldn't do on brf cakes.<br /><br />Every method has its advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; If you're trying to supply your local grocery stores with truckloads of fresh gourmet mushrooms, you wouldn't grow edibles on brf cakes.&nbsp; If you're trying to supply yourself with cubes, there's no cleaner and <i>faster</i> way to get personal amounts than with brf cakes.<br />RR","title":"Re: The truth about
