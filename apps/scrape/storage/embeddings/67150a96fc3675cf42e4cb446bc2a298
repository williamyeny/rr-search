were set for the second flush.&nbsp; That's the nature of fungi.&nbsp; Often, pins for the first three flushes are all set at the same time, but through a process we don't understand yet, the mycelium figures out which ones to mature and which ones to hold back for flush two and later.&nbsp; Picking them off sets you back.<br /><br />As for 2nd flush strategy, dunking will tend to initiate it, but it also helps to let the substrate dry out somewhat and 'rest' before initiating second flush with the soaking.&nbsp; Shiitake growers typically remove the blocks from the fruiting area, to allow them to dry in the colonization room at low humidity.&nbsp; This strategy works with cubes too, but you only need to let them rest for 6 to 7 days, not the two weeks we let shiitake sit.&nbsp; By allowing the substrate to partially dry, and then soaking, the next flush usually comes right along.&nbsp; In this regard, we're mimicking nature with warm temperatures, followed by a soaking rain.<br /><br />In general, you're going to get 80% or so of your potential product on the first two flushes, provided you've initiated them properly.&nbsp; Many growers feel their fruiting area real estate is better served by replacing post 2nd flush substrates with fresh ones to keep the cycle going at maximum.&nbsp; Everyone just needs to experiment and see what works best under their conditions.<br
