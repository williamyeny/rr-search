the rooms in the house were wired for 15A, the room where my games are is the only room that was having issues, so I took it up to 20A, I think that's just getting me by for now...<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Which means your house was wired with #14 wire, which is only rated at 15 amps without overheating.&nbsp; The breaker is sized to protect the wire, so going to a 20 amp breaker means your wire can heat up red hot, melting the insulation, and not trip the breaker.&nbsp; You've created a major fire hazard by changing the breaker to a higher size.&nbsp; There was a recent case in NY State where someone did that and burned the house down, killing two children.&nbsp; In addition to losing his kids, the guy was charged with negligent homicide and went to jail.&nbsp; I'd suggest running a larger wire if you're using a larger breaker.&nbsp; It could save your life.<br />RR","title":"Re: Calling all
