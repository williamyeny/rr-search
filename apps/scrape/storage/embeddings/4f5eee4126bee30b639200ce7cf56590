glass top stove.&nbsp; The reason is that the pressure cooker is not flat on the bottom.&nbsp; They're made for stove elements which will conform to the shape of the bottom, or gas.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing you'll get at walmart is made in china crap such as presto, which will give very limited use before it's worn out.&nbsp; Perhaps you can cash in your card from walmart and go to goodwill and find a used AA, which is a lifetime investment.<br />RR","title":"Re: Jar And Pressure Cooker
