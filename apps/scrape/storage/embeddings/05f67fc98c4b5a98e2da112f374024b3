I've never had one single invitro mushroom from a tropical species ever form in a slant.<br />Cause and effect can be tricky sometimes.  For example, if you get drunk as snot and drive, you're more likely to get in a car accident.  However, what if you have a cup of coffee in the morning and then get in an accident while sober?  Did the coffee cause the accident, or was it just 'your time'?  My experience says a tray that fruits after being put in the refrigerator was about to fruit anyway.  The fridge probably delayed it by a day or so in fact.  <br />There used to be a mindset that mycelium could compare to weed, where (in the case of weed) changing the photo period would signal a change from vegetative growth to flowering.  It was thought that a temp drop would change mycelium from vegetative growth to fruiting.  However, after many side-by-side tests, I've personally ruled out such a phenomena, so I pass that info along.  Feel free to experiment to either prove or disprove the above.  In no way do I consider my experiences the last word on the subject.  Mushroom cultivation, especially when compared to crop farming, is in its infancy and we're still learning.<br />RR","title":"Re: The fridge to initiate pinning
