What you're saying is that in the winter when condensation forms on your windows, your house must be at nearly 100%, when in fact it's closer to 10% or even less.  When you pull a beer out of the refrigerator or pour a glass of iced tea in the summer and the glass gets wet, does this mean it's 100% humidity, even if you're in the Arizona desert?  As said hundreds of times, condensation is caused by a TEMPERATURE differential between two surfaces.<br /><br />Cheap analog hygrometers are better than $100 digital ones.  All they need is an adjusting screw, and you simply wrap them up in a damp towel for an hour, or put them outside for an hour when it's been raining all night, and then adjust the screw on the back so the dial reads 99%.  The cheaper the hygrometer, the more often you'll need to calibrate it.  If you'll get an expensive brass hygrometer from a high end marine/boat dealer or cigar shop, you'll need to calibrate it less often, but at any rate, always check even a good one once per month.<br
