For many of us this is our hobby. There's vendor <br />syringes that sell for something like 8-9$. If you cannot afford<br />spores, how can anyone afford the rest of the materials.<br />And no offence, but you haven't been around long enough for <br />me to even want to donate prints. How can you expect Shroomery<br />(members) support with no credibility. And I think anyone who does <br />is a fool. Besides they can give them away for free themselves.<br />If you so badly want to help the community. Do what a lot of us <br />do. Fruit and obtain your own prints and hold giveaways. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\"
