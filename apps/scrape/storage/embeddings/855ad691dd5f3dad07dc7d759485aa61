That is taking the decomposed material after the mushrooms have done their work, and use that as dirt or a fertilizer to growing plants. Do anyone know if this could work? Have anyone tried anything similar?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It's been done for years.&nbsp; Last summer I did a project with the local weed control board where instead of spraying the roadsides, they enlisted boy scouts and church group kids to pull the weeds and then I donated the oyster mushroom spawn to turn it into food for their charity work.<br /><br />Last year I also did a bank stabilization project on damaged soils using over 2000 spent shiitake blocks.&nbsp; The mushroom mycelium breaks down the plant material or sawdust, compost, etc., and makes it available for plants.&nbsp; If you go to the nursery, you'll find 'mushroom compost' which is spent substrate blocks from agaricus farms.<br />RR<br /><br /><a
