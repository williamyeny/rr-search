terrarium, and don't worry about it dropping at night.&nbsp; Place the terrarium near a bright window during the day to get some solar heating and you may not even need the heater.&nbsp; <br />I'd skip the idea of a hot rag under it.&nbsp; The <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> works by having cooler air under and warmer air in the terrarium itself, caused by the lights and cakes or other substrates which provide heat.&nbsp; Since warm air is less dense than cool air, the cool air from below comes up into the terrarium, scrubbing moisture from the perlite to humidify the air above.&nbsp; Placing a heat source under the terrarium defeats the purpose.<br />RR","title":"Re: Novel idea
