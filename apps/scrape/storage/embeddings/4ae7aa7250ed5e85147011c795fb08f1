Of course not.<br /><br />When you hear noobs saying such things as 'this or that' strain colonizes faster, is contamination resistant, more rhyzomorphic, etc., take it to mean they don't have a clue and are on their first or second grow.&nbsp; Since every grow is different, new growers think the differences are in the name somebody wrote on the syringe, which is incorrect.<br />RR","title":"Re:
