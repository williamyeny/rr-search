give me approximately 800cfm overall moving through the box (someone correct me if I'm wrong).&nbsp; I'm not worried about size or weight, so long as the damn thing works.<br />Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.fungi.com/product-detail/product/24-x-18-x-58-micron-filter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">this</a> is the filter I will be using, in case anyone was wondering.</blockquote><br />It doesn't work that way.&nbsp; Stacking blowers does not double the flow.&nbsp; I'm wondering how you plan to power those DC motors.&nbsp; That's a fairly common voltage in telephone exchanges, but not in real life.<br />One of these days, FP should publish the stats on their filters so you can calculate the required blower size.&nbsp; Without a flow chart for the blower and filters, you can't do it.<br />RR","title":"Re: 24x18\" Flowhood Build, what cfm
