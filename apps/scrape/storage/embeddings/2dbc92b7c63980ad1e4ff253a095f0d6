The inside of the fridge is colder than the outside whereas in the terrarium the opposite is true.</i> <br />The beer from the fridge gets condensation on the warm side of the temp differential.&nbsp; The beer is cold, the air touching the can is warm, thus condensation forms on the warm side of the differential, JUST LIKE in a terrarium where the condensation forms on the warm side.&nbsp; It's the exact same principle.<br /><i>2. The temperature differential in the terrarium's case is much smaller than the fridge.</i>&nbsp; <br />Correct.<br /><i>3. You can observe the condensation without opening the terrarium. You aren't causing a sudden drastic temperature differential like you are by removing the beer from the fridge.</i> <br />Speed of temp change is not a factor.&nbsp; When air cools to the dewpoint, condensation will form whether or not it happened fast of slow.<br />This has gotten completely childish and ridiculous. If you want to argue, take it to OTD.&nbsp; If you have a valid point to make that's founded in science, then make it with science to back up your claims.&nbsp; A few others have chimed in to tell you how to determine dew point, how it's reached, and what happens when it is.&nbsp; You're arguing the indefensible point that condensation on the walls is an indicator of high humidity in a terrarium, which it is not, regardless of who has made the same mistake before.&nbsp; My terrariums are all sitting at 95% or greater, and not one of them has a single drop of condensation on the walls.&nbsp; However, I can take a sealed-up rubbermaid, put perlite and substrates in it, and shortly after I turn on the light overhead, condensation will form on the sides.&nbsp; Why? Temperature differential-It's warmer inside the terrarium than outside.<br />I strongly suggest any new growers to purchase a few analog hygrometers and calibrate them properly via the damp towel method weekly.&nbsp; Furthermore, discussions like this one give the impression to new growers that humidity is the most important factor in growing mushrooms, which it isn't.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is condensation an indicator of high rh?
