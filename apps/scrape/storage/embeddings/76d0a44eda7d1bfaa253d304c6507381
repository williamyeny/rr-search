money.<br />However, humidity is secondary.&nbsp; After full colonization of the substrate, fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, followed by bright light in the 6500K range.&nbsp; You're never going to get proper fresh air exchange with a fish pump running to a bubbler stone.&nbsp; In addition, standing water is a known breeding ground for contaminants.<br />I suggest a <a

money on.&nbsp; <br />When you build your shotgun terrarium, place it on the opposite side of the room from the AC unit.&nbsp; You don't want fans blowing in the room, especially on the terrarium.<br
