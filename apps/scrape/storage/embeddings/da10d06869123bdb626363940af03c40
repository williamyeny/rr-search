Just do it. If you really want to experiment, try something that hasn't already been tried a thousand times. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />I could post a thousand more links, but that's enough.&nbsp; To claim falsely that there's some sort of <b>totalitarian nature</b> here is just plain and simple telling a lie.&nbsp; Nothing is further from the truth. I've always rabidly encouraged experimentation, but what we object to is lazy-asses who argue a point that has been long disproved by tens of thousands of growers, and then tell others to go out and do their research for them.<br /><br />Grow up or go away.&nbsp; This sort of childish paranoia is not welcome here.<br />RR","title":"Re: SGFC - Why wouldn't holes 1\" apart be better than holes 2\"
