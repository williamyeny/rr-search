{"key":"embedding-11690925","value":{"id":11690925,"first":11681761,"last":13673392,"when":1261409111,"utime":"12/21/09 05:25 PM","content":"The black and white pipes are at the end of the fruiting area, and stick vertically from the ceiling through the soil to the air above.<br /><br />Air will flow any time there's a temperature or pressure difference.&nbsp; Nature hates a vacuum or anything out of equilibrium, such as different temperatures at each end of a pipe.&nbsp; Considering that it's almost always a different temperature under ground than above, there is constant passive air flow in and out of the container.&nbsp; I control the flow by blocking off part of the pipes to restrict it during winter to keep temperatures above freezing.&nbsp; Time will tell if I'll still get rid of enough CO2 once I get it fully loaded.&nbsp; <br /><br />During summer, there was always a noticeable wind coming from the pipes, and the temperature stayed a steady 60F inside.&nbsp; Now that it's been below 0F outside for two months, the temperature has dropped to the high 40s, which is still fine for oyster mushrooms.&nbsp;  I suspect this temp drop is related more to not getting the rest of the excavation work done before winter set in hard.&nbsp; Next spring, there will be an extra three to eight feet of soil piled on top of the container, returning the hillside to original grade.&nbsp; This will keep the freezing level well above the farm.&nbsp; The ground here is frozen about four to five feet deep at present.<br /><br />In addition to the two large pipes leaving the fruiting area, there are two 2\" PVC pipes that serve as drains from the concrete tank filled with rocks.&nbsp; These also allow a backflow of fresh air, and I can always feel a slight breeze coming up out of the rocks from that area.&nbsp; Once the farm is full of fruiting substrates, I'll monitor the CO2 and if necessary, install a wind powered turbine(like you see on roofs to vent the attic) on one of the roof vents.&nbsp; I put one on this summer, but took it back off for winter because it moved so much air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mountain Mushroom
