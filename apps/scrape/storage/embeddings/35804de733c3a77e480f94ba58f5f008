reflects off perlite, thus the brain fart since both were on my feeble old mind. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\"

Many species of mushrooms will turn and grow towards light, using that light as a source of direct or indirect energy.&nbsp; What you have heard me say many times is mushrooms don't need light to \"tell them\" which way to grow, as mushrooms grown in total darkness will grow straight up, opposite gravity.<br />RR","title":"Re: What Causes This? - PE DROOP HEADS
