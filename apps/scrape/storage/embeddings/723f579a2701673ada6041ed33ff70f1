We lime our casing layers to a basic pH of around 8 to 8.5 to help prevent molds.&nbsp; We leave our substrates at the natural pH of the substrate material, which in most cases is fairly acidic.&nbsp; Gypsum is often added to help prevent wild swings in pH due to the acidic qualities of mushroom metabolites, and to supply calcium and sulfur.<br />Please continue to study and learn.&nbsp; Thanks.
