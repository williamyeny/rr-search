Sporeworks also has an excellent MEA, but I was out at the time, so used some FP agar mix I had(you'll notice I turned the jar so the label didn't show <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/>. In real-life, I mix my own, but for the new growers watching the DVD, I wanted to make it as easy as possible, while still getting good results.&nbsp; Once you gain a bit of experience, mix your own.&nbsp; Use 20 grams of agar-agar per liter of water to solidify the mix, but use less nutrients than the recipes call for, for the reasons stated above.<br />Peroxide is toxic to fungi, ALL fungi, so the last thing you want is peroxidated agar.&nbsp; You're supposed to transfer healthy mycelium away from contaminants, not hide or prevent the contaminants from growing temporarily.&nbsp; You actually WANT the contaminants to grow on your agar so you can see them and get your mycelium away.&nbsp; Antibiotics are a great addition if you're trying to isolate mushroom mycelium from an outdoor fruit that is laden with bacteria.&nbsp; Antibiotics, which are made from mycelium metabolites, won't impede your mycelium, but WILL impede bacteria.<br />RR","title":"Re: pouring petri dishes in a
