In fact, I won't step foot in one of their stores, but that's just me.  Hydrated means 'water soluable' so it is effective immediately.  The 'safe' limes are slow release, intended for fall lawns and gardens so they break down over the winter for pH balancing by the following spring.  Most are from dolomitic limestone which is too high in Mg for mycelium.<br />You can order hydrated lime from best hardware stores at <a href=\"http://www.doitbest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.doitbest.com</a>   Type in hydrated lime when you get to their site's search feature.  I get mine in 50lb bags from a nursery for $6.  Gypsum is more important than lime, imo., so don't forget to get that.  To my surprise when I was at Lowes yesterday, they had hydrated lime, gypsum, vermiculite, and perlite.<br />RR","title":"Re: need some help with
