very bad advice.&nbsp; Unless people say otherwise, they're growing cubes, and cubes don't benefit from a cold shock, nor does any other mushroom which fruits in semi-tropical areas in the

yes casing is required if you're wanting to use grains as your substrate.&nbsp; Here's a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Casing-Layer-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">mushroom casing video clip</a> to walk you through the casing prep.&nbsp; It's only a sample clip, but should give you the idea.&nbsp; The full tek is on the DVD.<br />RR","title":"Re:
