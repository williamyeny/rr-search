{"key":"embedding-6123902","value":{"id":6123902,"first":6123567,"last":6125058,"when":1159805733,"utime":"10/02/06 07:15 PM","content":"Yea, that's my tek.  Here it is.<br />RR<br />Pasteurization tek<br />Load the pre-moistened to field capacity casing mix, compost or manure into quart mason jars.  Place a lid and/or foil over the top.  Put the jars into a large covered pot of cold water, with the water filled to 2/3 to ¾ of the way up the jars. A large kettle or pressure cooker works well.  If necessary, put a plate or some other weight over the jars to prevent them from floating.  Make sure you have a spacer or dishtowel under the jars to prevent the direct heat of the stove burner or flame from cracking your jars. Place the lid on the pot and turn on the stove. Bring the water to a boil, but watch over it and as soon as the water actually reaches a boil, shut off the stove, but leave the pot sitting on the burner.  The preceding is for an electric stove that will remain hot for a little while after shutting off power.  If you use gas, allow the water to boil for one to two minutes before shutting off the stove.  After a couple of hours when they’ve cooled, the jars can be removed and used.<br />The first time or two you use this technique, monitor the interior of your jars with a meat thermometer.  Place it right into the center of the peat or compost.  You want to make sure the center of the jar reaches at least 140F and stays there for an hour, but don’t allow it to exceed 170F.  Depending on the thickness and capacity of your kettle and lid, you may need to adjust the above times slightly.  This tek works because glass is an insulator, so the temperature inside the jars lags the water in the kettle.  When I use the above procedure with 7 full quart jars in my All American 921, it comes out perfectly just as written.   If you use a smaller pot, you may need to turn the stove on briefly at the ½ hour mark for a few minutes.<br />The advantage to this tek is there is no pillowcase, etc., to drain and little to no mess or stink is made in your kitchen or pressure cooker.  The disadvantage is you have a bunch of jars to wash when you’re done.<br />RR","title":"Re: hydrated
