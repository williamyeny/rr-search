bottom, and pass through the perlite to the top, thus collecting moisture.&nbsp; A shotgun terrarium should always be elevated on jars, cans, bricks, etc., so that air can circulate and enter/exit from all six sides.&nbsp; The second reason for getting it up is that over 90% of the contaminant spores in a room are hovering within 1 foot of the floor.&nbsp; You should move the terrarium to a desk or table, and then elevate it above that.<br /><br />I've never seen condensation in a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; The holes provide enough air exchange that the temperature remains near equal on each side.<br />RR","title":"Re: too many holes in my
