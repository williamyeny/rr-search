It's not so much about how many grain to grain transfers you've done but about how many cell divisions the mycelium has undergone.&nbsp; Note that mycelium which has had 4 G2G with pint jars will have undergone far less cell divisions than mycelium which has had 4 G2G with large spawn bags.<br /><br />My favorite shiitake strain was received by me in 2001 as a P5, and is now a P8.&nbsp; I generally expand two petri dishes with it, and then inoculate grains. After that, I do 4 to 5 G2G transfers with large spawn bags before using the grains to spawn to supplemented sawdust for fruiting.&nbsp; This turns each petri dish wedge into about 10,000 quarts of rye, and I do it without senescence. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone buy my shiitake in a store and try to clone it to start over.&nbsp; Performance would be poor at best.<br />RR","title":"Re: senescence
