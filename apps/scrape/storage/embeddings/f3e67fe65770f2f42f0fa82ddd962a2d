definitely preferred. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />If that were the case, why are mushrooms grown on straw so good?&nbsp; <br /><br />Stamets says in one of his books that choice of substrate affects potency.&nbsp; My experiments have shown that to not be the case, so I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; Whenever I've isolated a potent substrain on agar, it develops the same potency whether it's grown on manure, coir, straw, bible, bra, brf cake, stuffed animal, etc., leading me to conclude that it's genetic.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the overall scheme of things, mushroom cultivation is still in its infancy, so the state of our art is constantly changing as our knowledge base expands.&nbsp; When you read a book written 50 or even 20 years ago, you can bet your last dollar that at least something in it is now known not to be correct.&nbsp; I'm certain such will be the case with what we now consider 'fact' 20 or 50 years from now.<br />RR","title":"Re: Does substrate effect
