There's just too much fail here.&nbsp; You're going to have to stop pulling shit out of your ass such as it takes hundreds of thousands of PSI to cause a pressure cooker to fail.&nbsp; That's just stupid.&nbsp; A pressure cooker is not solid aluminum, it's forged in the case of AA or stamped in the case of the cheap chinese ones.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>sansa said:</strong><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b><i>RogerRabbit said:</i></b><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />If you've got the math, post it. </blockquote><br />No.<br />Search the ASTM database yourself. I gave you the answer but I won't do your damn research too if you don't want to hear it! What you said is exactly why they say to never use more than 12K btu and leave it at that. It's a safety issue.&nbsp; I have a 160,000 BTU propane burner I use on 55 gallon drums and a pressure cooker would fit on it perfectly.&nbsp; It would blow that cheap ass made in china PC all the way back to china in about 2 minutes with blowout plugs venting.<br />RR</blockquote><br />Fair enough, here's some actual math for you, my blustery friend.<br />Using the \"Air Flow Rate through an Orifice\" calculator:<br /><a href=\"http://www.tlv.com/global/TI/calculator/air-flow-rate-through-orifice.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.tlv.com/global/TI/cal<wbr>culator/air-flow-rate-through-ori<wbr>fice.html</a><br />With values 120C, 50 psi, 14.7 psi, .250 in and .7 I get .38 cubic meters per minute.<br />Assume the PC starts out with 10 quarts of liquid, that's 0.00946353 cubic meters. That means the blowout value can empty the entire liquid contents in 0.00946353/.38=0.02490402631 minutes or 1.49424157 seconds.<br />Now, the question remains is can your 200k BTU burner deliver enough pressure to the pressure cooker within 1.49 seconds of the blowout valve tripping at 50 psi that it actually, as you put it, \"explodes\"?<br />I'm going to say \"no\" to that given that it probably took a minimum of 5 minutes for the PC to get up to 50 PSI and it takes hundreds of thousands of PSI to actually explode aluminum.<br />Aluminum has a yield strength of 414 mega pascals which is 60045 PSI. While I'm not sure how to use this to calculate the exact point at which a solid sealed aluminum PC will explode, whatever it is it's probably two to three orders of magnitude greater than the piddly 50 psi needed to pop the blowout valve.<br />For one thing, it takes 100 PSI to blow up a plastic soda bottle, so your PC is going to blow up somewhere far beyond 100 PSI.<br />There's no way any propane burner that takes 5 minutes to get to 50 PSI can raise the PSI anywhere close to even 100 PSI in a second and a half.<br />And you're very welcome for me doing this research for you so that next time someone asks this question you can direct them to this post rather than posting the incorrect information you posted originally.</blockquote>","title":"Re: Making adapter to use presto PC
