'Wet spot' is a generic name we use to mean bacterial contamination.  <i>Bacillus</i> is a genus that includes perhaps thousands of species of bacteria.  Since we're not biologists, and really not qualified to identify each and every bacteria down to species, we just call that nasty, slimy, greasy stuff 'wet spot' or 'bacteria', or 'bacillus'.  That is indeed what is wrong with those jars.<br />1/2 gallon grain jars are especially susceptible to bacterial contamination for two reasons.  One, it's hard for the gasses to exchange unless you let them colonize laying on their sides, and two, the heat produced in the interior of the jars tends to favor bacteria.  The glass is an insulator that holds the heat in, and it can easily spiral out of control in large jars.  That's why I gave up on them and only use quart sized jars for grains.  Spawn bags don't have that problem because they allow the heat to escape easier than it can escape from glass.<br />RR","title":"Re: bacillus, sour rot, wet spot, are these one and the
