pinning strategy so you'll get a shitty first flush.<br />If you do everything right, you'll get 70% or more of the total potential harvest from first flush.&nbsp; I always roll my eyes at guys who talk about four or five flushes.&nbsp; It means they're not tweaking their conditions to maximize performance.&nbsp; Nobody gets four or five flushes of closed canopy, wall-to-wall mushrooms.<br
