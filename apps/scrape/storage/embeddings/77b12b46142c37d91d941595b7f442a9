companies replanting trees too close together, thinking only of 'board feet of lumber' and not the health of the overall forest.&nbsp; I'm just wondering out loud if cultured trichoderma could be inoculated on the trees or soil nearby to drive the Armillaria out.<br /><br />I'm too busy this year, but I plan to harvest samples and submit for DNA testing to determine if I'm living on the
