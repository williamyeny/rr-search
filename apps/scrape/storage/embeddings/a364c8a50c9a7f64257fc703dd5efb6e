higher pressure than warm air\"<br />This is not true.&nbsp; Just check the ideal gas law: PV=nRT.&nbsp; Pressure and Temperature are proportional, if one goes up, so does the other.</blockquote><br />That formula applies to monoatomic gasses in a sealed vessel, not a terrarium with holes in it exposed to ambient air at normal atmospheric pressure.<br />The cooler air surrounding the perlite has the molecules closer together, thus at slightly higher pressure.&nbsp; The warmer air above has the molecules farther apart, thus lower pressure.&nbsp; Remember, a terrarium with holes all over it is not a sealed vessel where a rise in temperature causes a corresponding rise in pressure.<br />You are correct that humid air is lighter(less dense) which is also a contributing factor in it rising to the relatively drier air above.&nbsp; A balloon rises because the hot air within is <i>less dense</i> than the cooler air around it.&nbsp; It's not due to the effects of gravity on the air itself.&nbsp; An airplane wing produces lift by creating a lower pressure area above the wing and a higher pressure area below the wing.&nbsp; The carburetor on an old car works the same way, creating a lower pressure zone within the venturi, which draws fuel from the bowl through the jets and into the intake manifold.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun Fruiting Chamber
