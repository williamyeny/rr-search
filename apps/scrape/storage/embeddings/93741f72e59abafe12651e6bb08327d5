Leaving the foil in place causes condensation, which gets the dry vermiculite filter damp, making it useless.&nbsp; You'll have a lower chance and rate of contamination if you keep the verm filter dry.&nbsp; Remove tape from the holes if it's not breathable tape too.&nbsp; Colonizing jars need those holes open for gas exchange.<br />3) Normal room lighting is fine during colonization.&nbsp; In fact, there is a LOT of evidence to show that it helps later when it comes time for pinning.&nbsp; Mycelium has a circadian rhythm just like animals.&nbsp; Expose to normal ambient lighting to help establish this rhythm.&nbsp; The old advice to colonize in darkness is outdated and incorrect.&nbsp; Paul Stamets, who wrote to keep colonizing jars in the dark in his book \"The Mushroom Cultivator\" disavowed that advice and corrected it 8 years later when he published \"Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms\", yet people keep repeating the bad advice 18 years later.<br />4) Use a glovebox or still air box for inoculations.&nbsp; The latter is what is demonstrated in 'Let's Grow Mushrooms'.&nbsp; Never inoculate in open air.&nbsp; Some people are satisfied with loosing ten to twenty percent of their jars to contamination due to carelessness or laziness.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; A 1% failure rate is too much.&nbsp; Don't inoculate in a kitchen or bathroom. Those are the two filthiest places in any house.<br />5) Let your jars colonize in normal room temperature on an open shelf.&nbsp; The circulating air will provide gas exchange and keep your verm filter dry.&nbsp; The verm filter catches and traps contaminants before they get to the brf below.&nbsp; When you birth the jars a week or more after full colonization, rinse the verm filter off under the faucet as shown in the video before dunking.<br />6) Next time, use spring or tap water to make your substrate jars.&nbsp; Distilled water lacks essential minerals for healthy mycelium, and also leads to a higher rate of contamination.<br />Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: New to growing shroomies
