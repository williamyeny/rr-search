href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/8903929#Post8903929\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">Trusted Cultivator</a> tag had called that overlay, their tag would be gone.<br />You don't have overlay because there is no casing layer.&nbsp; Geezus, if I could rig the board to not even allow the word overlay to be typed, I'd do it in a second.&nbsp; In three decades of growing, I've only seen overlay a dozen or so times and NEVER on a cubensis casing layer.&nbsp; By definition, a substrate can NOT be overlayed.&nbsp; Overlay is nearly dead, dry, matted and lifeless mycelium.&nbsp; It does NOT mean full colonization.<br />You want to allow your coir substrates to fully colonize, so cover them back up for a couple more days.&nbsp; When they're solid white, uncover and expose to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; If you choose to use a casing layer, it can be applied at that time.&nbsp; I'd suggest fruiting uncased, since cased coir or straw will hardly ever outperform uncased.<br
