this thread are lacking a basic understanding of the science that leads to condensation on a surface.<br />Condensation on a surface indicates a <b>temperature differential</b> across that surface.&nbsp; My glass of iced tea will have condensation on it even if I'm in Phoenix, AZ or the Sahara Desert in the middle of summer.&nbsp; Now, in each of those places the ambient humidity is 10% or less, but condensation still forms.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because there is above zero percent humidity and a temperature differential.&nbsp; There would be no condensation form in outer space.<br />The above being said, condensation represents moisture that USED to be suspended in the air, but is no more due to the temperature differential which causes the air at the surface to be cooled to its dew point, thus forming condensation.&nbsp; This moisture does not indicate in any way, shape or form that there is sufficient moisture in the air to grow mushrooms.<br />Condensation is not a representation of high humidity.&nbsp; A sealed monotub will have condensation during colonization because the mycelium is producing heat as it feeds on the substrate, therefore the air in the monotub is warmer than the air outside.&nbsp; Condensation always forms on the warm side of a surface where there is a temperature differential.&nbsp; Anyone who has watched brf or grain jars colonize has noticed condensation inside the glass.&nbsp; That's because it's warmer inside the jar than outside.<br />For those of you unable to understand the above, please simply accept it, but don't make fools of yourselves by trying to argue that which you don't understand.&nbsp; I won't sticky the thread because that seems to be the best place to hide things so nobody sees them.&nbsp; That's why we have to lock a dozen or more strain threads every day. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif\" alt=\":tongue:\" title=\":tongue:\"/><br
