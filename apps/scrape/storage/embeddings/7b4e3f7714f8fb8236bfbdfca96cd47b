of heat exchange will be locked.&nbsp; Anyone who doesn't understand how moist air holds heat better than dry air needs to go outside on a clear, dry night.&nbsp; The temperature will drop like a rock.&nbsp; Go outside on a foggy or cloudy night, and the temperature remains stable.&nbsp; Indoors, a normal room humidity of 25% to 35% during winter will save energy over the 5% or less we see in cold climates.&nbsp; One should also keep a window cracked open for fresh air unless you like breathing stale air, even if leaving a window open loses some of your heat or AC.<br />Anonjon, I've had enough of your stirring up shit around here.&nbsp; You're a fucking drama queen and I'm sick to tears of it.&nbsp; It seems that every day you have PMs in my&nbsp; box, snitching on what others are doing, while you're flaming and posting stupid shit like the above<br />For anyone else who is genuinely interested in how moist air holds heat better even though it's less dense, here's the exact
