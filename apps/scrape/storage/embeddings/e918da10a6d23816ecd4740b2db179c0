fruiting chamber a suitable temperature and humidity for the mushrooms to grow in.&nbsp; not sure if this has been done before.&nbsp; is it a viable idea? </blockquote><br />No, it's not.&nbsp; Humidity is only part of what you want.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger.&nbsp; Humidity without constant fresh air does no good.&nbsp; Build a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> and get ready for good performance.&nbsp; It's the result of many years of actual experience.&nbsp; I've also typed at least 1000 times not to heat a terrarium because it causes your humidity to be lost as useless condensation on the walls.&nbsp; Fruit your mushrooms in a shotgun terrarium at normal room temperature.&nbsp; If necessary, get a space heater.<br />In two months, nearly every post will be about how to COOL the fruiting chamber.&nbsp; Just watch and see.&nbsp; We go through this every single year.&nbsp; It's amazing what you guys can find if you'll use the search function.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidification
