/>Nope, gas stove rules!&nbsp; Offers most even heating and easy use.&nbsp; You'll only melt containers if your cooker runs out of water.<br />That's a plenty good deal for the containers.</blockquote><br />I also love gas stoves, but one thing to consider is that the flame and/or extreme heat from the flame will curl around the bottom and up the sides.&nbsp; If this happens, the plastic won't have any protection until the interior is saturated with steam and pressure is reached.&nbsp; At that time the temp can't get over 250F/121C so the plastic is protected.<br />However, during warmup when there is no steam in the upper chamber the flame-curl can melt the plastic.&nbsp; This isn't a problem with electric stoves, but people need to be cautious of this with gas stoves and make sure the bags or other plastic containers are protected from touching the sides.<br />RR","title":"Re: \"Violet tek\" & Easy Casing layers â€¢ Growing from watered whole grains in
