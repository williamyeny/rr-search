Thus, the connection is made that the <i>drop</i> in temperatures caused the pinning.  It makes sense right?<br />However, what if he had a tray that he exposed to a ten degree temperature rise and a few days later he got pins?  Could he not make the same case that the <i>increase</i> in temperature caused the pinning?  In fact, this is what happens in nature.  A summer rain(thunderstorm) comes, which 'dunks' the substrate, and then when the sun comes out, the mushrooms pop up very fast, often in 80's and 90's degree temperature.  One could make a very good case that in nature, it's the <i>increase</i> in temperature that stimulates the pinset.  It's a survival mechanism.  They need to spread spores before the mycelium dries out again.<br />I've done both of the above scenarios dozens, if not hundreds of times to get to the bottom of this.  That's the reason I say what I do that temperature drop does not play a part in the pinning strategy of tropical species.  In fact, some of the best pinsets came when fruiting conditions were five degrees or more warmer than colonization temperature.<br />Cold shocking is the signal that fall fruiting mycelium needs to begin producing fruits.  Shiitake, P cyanescens, p nameko, etc., to name a few require a cold shock to fruit.  Cubensis, H ulmarium, Pan Cyanescens, etc., do not require a cold shock.<br />The above is not to discourage experimenting in any way.  However, get your ducks in a row, and have many duplicate projects made exactly the same way, and spawned, colonized, cased, etc., exactly the same way, and then cold shock some, and increase temps on others.  Keep controls that fruit in exactly the temperature they colonize in.<br />From my experience, if you do the above, your results will vary.  Sometimes the cold shocked tray will fruit sooner, but other times later, often much later.  Ditto for the other parameters.  This is what has led me to my conclusions. The other pinning triggers of full colonization, increased air exchange, and near 100% humidity far outweigh temperature considerations.  Good luck to all.  Experimenting is how we learn.<br />RR","title":"Re: The fridge to initiate pinning
