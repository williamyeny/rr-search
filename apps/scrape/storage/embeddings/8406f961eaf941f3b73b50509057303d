ground beds where they have a chance to warm up, performance is much better.<br />To the OP, the prevailing wisdom is a casing layer is more forgiving, but if you screw up maintaining the casing layer, you're right back in the same boat.&nbsp; If you're only around once or twice a day to mist, a casing layer might be called for, since it can serve as a reservoir for moisture.&nbsp; If you're around all day to perform multiple mistings, that's probably the better choice, in which scenario I'd fruit uncased.<br />Bear in mind, if your substrate is just a layer of grains, you'll need a casing.&nbsp; It's only optional on bulk substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is a cased substrate more
