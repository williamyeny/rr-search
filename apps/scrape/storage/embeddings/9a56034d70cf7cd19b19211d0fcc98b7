Certainly the low setting on a food dehydrator is not going to hurt anything.  You can have a nice trip on mushrooms cooked over a very hot grill.  Rub a bit of Ceasar or Blue Cheese dressing into the gills, olive oil on the cap, and cook until nice and tender, gill side up. Add salt and pepper to suit your taste. They actually taste good too.  I only grill the caps.  The stems are going to taste nasty cooked or uncooked, so don't bother.<br />RR","title":"Re: Nesco Food Dehydrator on Clearance at
