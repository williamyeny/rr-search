However, part of experimenting is reporting the results accurately, even if they don't match what we 'thought' would happen.&nbsp; Good luck to all, and never be afraid to try something just because it's weird.<br />In fact, people are so resistant to change, perhaps if you have a 'weird' idea, just go ahead and try it rather than posting first.&nbsp; If it works, post the pics.&nbsp; That way, nobody can call you an idiot. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: What are your
