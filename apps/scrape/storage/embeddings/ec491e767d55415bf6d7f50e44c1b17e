grain to grain transfers, etc., as generations even though a well-known book got it wrong 30 years ago.<br />The op had it right the first time.&nbsp; Spores to fruits constitute a generation.&nbsp; You are the next generation from your parents.&nbsp; Your kids will be the next generation from you.<br />If you're skinny and then get fat(expanded) it isn't a generation, it's beer.<br
