mushrooms.&nbsp; It raises pH when needed, which is rare considering that mushrooms prefer an acidic substrate.&nbsp; <br /><br />If one is going to build a casing layer, hydrated lime is superior to the others which don't break down fast enough to alter pH during the short lifespan of a cased substrate tray.&nbsp; Hydrated lime will dry your hands if you rub it all over you and don't wash it off.&nbsp; Anyone who has mixed concrete or mortar mix and got some on their hands have experienced this, since it's very high in hydrated lime.<br />RR","title":"Re: limestone flour, horticultural
