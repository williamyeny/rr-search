that is a poor excuse for a fence lol<br />but yeah lovely pasture to go gathering!</blockquote><br />Where I live now, there are no fences.&nbsp; The cows and horses are free to roam the open range, a few million acres of it.&nbsp; We round them up on horseback in the fall.&nbsp; This makes for excellent, organic grass-fed beef.&nbsp; I haven't had to buy a steak since I moved here.&nbsp; We put tags in their ears so we know who's cows belongs to who, and during round up season, we round up all the cows we find, regardless of owner.&nbsp; They're then separated once in the corrals.<br />It sure seems strange to see cows behind a fence like that. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\":lol:\"/><br />I doubt you'll get cubes to grow in a non-native-like habitat.&nbsp; If it's hot and dry all summer, the cow pies dry totally out and the sun bakes the mycelium until it nukes it.&nbsp; Cubes grow in cow manure in climates that get regular rain or at least thunderstorms all summer.&nbsp; If there's no rain in June-Sept, the mycelium will dry out and die.<br />RR","title":"Re: Feed My Horse
