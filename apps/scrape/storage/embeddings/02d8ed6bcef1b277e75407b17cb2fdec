zone.&nbsp; Find one single instance where I've ever banned someone for disagreeing with me or for posting something which is factually incorrect or goes against 'established procedures'.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're all here to learn, and as a commercial farm owner I learn new things every day which I promptly share either here or on my own site.&nbsp; That tends to butthurt those who think posts from ten years ago contain all the knowledge that will ever be known.<br /><br />To the OP, start off with small quantities of the avian droppings mixed into horse manure or coir, straw, etc., and go from there.&nbsp; If you have too rich a substrate it won't fruit or will have diminished fruiting performance or excessive mutant production.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about pigeon
