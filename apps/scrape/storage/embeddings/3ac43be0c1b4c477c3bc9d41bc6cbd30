You'll find it at the very top of the page.<br />I can't dumb it down any more, so I'll post it here for your benefit.&nbsp; Your thread dealt with pf cakes, which is covered in item 2 of the forum guidelines.&nbsp; You seriously need to stop being butthurt that your thread was moved to the appropriate forum and your question properly answered.<br />RR<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b><br />Advanced Mycology Forum Guidelines</b><br />1) Please be respectful to other users in this forum, we will not tolerate flaming, not for any reason - the post will be closed, and appropriate actions will be taken against the user involved.<br /><b>2) This forum is for the discussion of advanced techniques and experimental procedures. This forum is NOT a support forum, for problems with your grows. Any posts regarding your PF Cakes, a species which has been cultivated ad nauseam, grain ratios, contaminated grows, how to prepare dung, or anything else which has been covered in the forum, etc... will be moved immediately upon review - so please, do not waste the resources, time, or bandwidth of the shroomery.</b><br />3) Use the SEARCH feature. This is one of the most comprehensive methods of finding if something has been posted, please use a little bit of creativity in your searches, and append all words which you think you may be able to find posts regarding your subject. It's a very simple and helpful tool. The search engine GOOGLE also has a lot of information.<br />4) No thread hijacking! - We request that people please be respectful of others threads, and do not change the subject of it. If someone is discussing something that does not interest you, yet provokes a different idea, rather than changing the subject of their thread, start your own! It makes things much easier to categorize and archive.<br />5) Please do not ressurect dead threads - Along with the search feature being an excellent tool, it also allows you to revive threads days, months, weeks, and years old. So please, be careful of what you're reposting. If you have something to add to the thread, by all means do so! But please be careful in not posting little 1 or 2 line responses like \"good idea\" to something that has been in the graveyard for 2 years.<br />6) Please read the FAQ if you ask a question which is covered within the FAQ, your thread will be moved, it's a good read, and contains a LOT of VERY valuable information, I would say it's about as necessary a read as the mushroom cultivator. So please, read this - it helps everyone.<br />7) Spelling - In order to keep this forum as smoothly running as possible, we request that people familliarize themselves with the correct spellings and terms applicable in mycology, if you're unfamilliar with mycology terms, most likely your post doesn't belong here, if you're just a poor speller, or forgot something - there is an index of terms located HERE and ALSO HERE , thank you.<br />8) NO OFF TOPICS - no threads that do not pertain to experimentation or advanced mushroom cultivation techniques. This includes threads that begin \"what would you do with...\" \"where can i get some...\", there are exceptions, but it must be warranted.</blockquote>","title":"Re: bee pollen ?
