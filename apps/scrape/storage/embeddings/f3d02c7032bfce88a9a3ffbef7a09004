It provides calcium to your substrate and can be fully beneficial at only ~2% of substrate volume. The person who started the use of gypsum here had falsely claimed the ph related effects and has since stated he was mistaken.</blockquote><br />Not exactly.<br />Gypsum is and always has been added to substrates for the calcium and sulfur.&nbsp; A side benefit is that gypsum tends to help prevent the pH from swinging too low due to the mycelium's metabolism.&nbsp; Gypsum isn't used to change the pH one way or the other, but it does tend to keep it stable.<br />Coffee provides a boost in production but it's not for the lazy.&nbsp; If one doesn't prepare his substrates properly, mold will soon follow.&nbsp; I use coffee in every substrate, and see mold about one substrate out of a thousand.&nbsp; The key to getting the increased production from using coffee is proper sterile procedure and/or clean work and pasteurization at the proper temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Gypsum and
