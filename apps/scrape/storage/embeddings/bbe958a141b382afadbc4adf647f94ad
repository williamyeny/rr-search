unrelated to temperature drops.<br />I personally arrived at the 6500K optimum light color through thousands of grows with literally dozens of lights of all types, wattage, and spectrum.&nbsp; Since that time, it's been repeatedly verified by thousands of growers here and elsewhere.&nbsp; I use 6500K in my own shiitake farm, and the two farms I work with in the Seattle area have both switched to 6500K and their harvests have gone up by 20% over the 'cool white' or 5000K fixtures they were using previously.&nbsp;  My tests showed that above 7,000K, performance begins to fall off.&nbsp; 6500K
