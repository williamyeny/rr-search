However, before any friends become enemies, perhaps the religion discussion can be continued in the religion forum.  I have found out the hard way more than once that politics and religion don't mix with other activities, especially hobbies.<br />I always mix in a bit of used coffee grinds with horse manure.  Also, some benefit is to be had by mixing in a very small amount of chicken manure, but no more than about 2% by volume.  Ten to twenty percent by volume of vermiculite will help the mycelium to colonize the manure substrate faster, and also helps to balance moisture content, but by all means know that it's optional.  The same goes for perlite.  Perlite holds air, so it tends to help keep the manure substrate from packing down too tight, essentially serving the same purpose it does in houseplant soil.  Some growers also add a small amount of blood meal, but in my experience, I haven't seen much benefit to it.  A tablespoon or two per tray however certainly doesn't hurt.<br />Horse manure by itself is great, but I've found that by supplementing with the above makes an excellent substrate even better.<br
