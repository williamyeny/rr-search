It's hard to beat cased grains.  I've seen some HUGE fruits from it.  Grains, especially rye, are far more nutritious then any bulk substrate.  We use grains to inoculate large amounts of bulk substrate, making the total harvest larger if you have the room for it all.  However, in a given sized tray, you'll have a hard time beating cased grains, by using cased manure.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Isn't Doc's straight WBS as well, something that \"shouldn't work well\"</blockquote><br />Corrrect.
