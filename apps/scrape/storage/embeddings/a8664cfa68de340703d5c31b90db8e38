In the tech it calls for a thin layer of berm and coir on top of the mix, I assumed it was a casing due to the nature of it. So after this tech is fully colonized a casing would be a good to apply?</blockquote><br />The tek calls for a thin layer of verm/coir over the top after spawning for the purpose of covering all the exposed grains.&nbsp; It's not a casing layer and it colonizes at the same time as the substrate, which it's a part of.&nbsp; If one leaves grains exposed, they dry out which causes the mycelium to die-back.&nbsp; Green molds then move into the available habitat, ruining the project.<br />Your thread title should have read 'ideal amount of colonization for <i>substrate</i>'.<br
