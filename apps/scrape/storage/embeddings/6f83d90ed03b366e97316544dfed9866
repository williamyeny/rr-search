contained therein is a good thing.&nbsp; When the cakes are submerged during the dunk, bacteria is favored in the anaerobic conditions under water, and the chlorine helps to control it.<br />I'm getting my commercial mushroom farm certified organic in one of the strictest states to get organic certification, and there is no problem with spraying the fruiting areas with bleach solution, and/or using it in the soak water.&nbsp; It's a long tested and safe method.&nbsp; Consider it the lesser of two evils if you wish:&nbsp; Bacteria, which can kill you, or chlorine which only tastes funny, but in small amounts is relatively harmless.<br />My cabin is very remote and off the grid.&nbsp; Therefore, I have a 400 feet deep well that delivers pristine drinking water.&nbsp; However, when dunking substrates, I add a cap full of bleach per bucket of water for the reasons stated above.&nbsp; It doesn't impact the grow in a negative way at all.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is tap water the right
