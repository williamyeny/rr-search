I know I am not supposed to bump this thread for 24 hours, and I want to apologize to the other poster's who have actual relevant questions pertaining to a proper grow. This to me is very serious problem and unethical by using Pigeon waste as a substrate. And if I have to prove this, I will. I am actually baffled why people would support this idea that OP has. I thought it was supposed to be and supported by natural substrates that isn't going to cause infections and or diseases? Or am I wrong? Is this the new era of growing? Is this the direction people are going to go? This is what you all want to see happening in future growers-young and old? Because if it is, I don't want to be associated with it. Sorry. If you you all want to support the OP, go ahead but, why clean anything, why sterilize anything, why take precautions???...eat the Trich, inhale the black molds, share your grows and brag and get other people sick. Good idea, I think I will pass.</blockquote><br />This has to be one of the strangest things I've ever read around here or anywhere else.<br />Are you saying that pasteurized or sterilized pigeon/chicken manure is bad because of bacteria, but pasteurized or sterilized cow or horse manure doesn't have those same or similar organisms?&nbsp; Here's a news flash;&nbsp; A bio-diverse substrate rich in microorganisms will outperform a single element substrate every time.&nbsp; I've substantially increased production of our <a href=\"http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">certified organic mushroom farm</a> by adding small amounts of composted chicken manure to the substrates prior to heat treatment.&nbsp; Don't knock what you don't understand, and please can the arrogance, especially considering you're flat-out wrong. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\"
