is what Stamets recommends for casing layer in his book.</blockquote><br />Thank you for using the search engine.&nbsp; I've been on somewhat of a rant today for folks failing to search for their answers first.&nbsp; However, if you read that post again, I'm not saying to use both.&nbsp; Use limestone or hydrated lime.&nbsp; I prefer hydrated lime for casing layers because it goes to work right away when the contaminant spores are landing on your casing layer.&nbsp; <br />Limestone takes time to break down enough to alter the pH, and the average life of a casing layer is less than thirty days, so the limestone isn't going to be of much use.&nbsp; I used to advise against type S hydrated lime, but after using it repeatedly, it works fine.&nbsp; Get it at masonry shops or feed stores, but be careful.&nbsp; A little bit goes a long way and you can certainly make your casing layer too basic if you use too much.<br />RR","title":"Re: Limestone
