sclerotia is to allow the mycelium to dry totally out during adverse weather conditions and then rejuvenate once the weather returns to a more suitable state.<br />I and others have posted many threads showing how sclerotia can be used as inoculant for agar.&nbsp; You cut from the center of a freshly broken piece of sclerotia to reduce the ambient contaminant load.&nbsp; Once transferred, anything you see within 48 to 60 hours is a contaminant, so you're growing 100% contams.<br />It takes much longer than that for the dry sclerotia to hydrate and become active again.<br
