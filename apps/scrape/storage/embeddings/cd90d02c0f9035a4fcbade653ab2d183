total useful light than wavelength.&nbsp; You are correct.&nbsp; With certain species, very bright light will slow down colonization, but low level light of around 100 lux will speed up growth with those same species.&nbsp; It amounts to experimenting with various species and even strains of various species to determine what works best.<br />If you'll search the board for posts over the last two years, you'll find hundreds of growers who switched to 6500K fluorescent lighting with their P cubensis and reported dramatic improvements in performance.&nbsp; A few of us are experimenting with LED, and to the best of my knowledge, I have the only commercial shiitake farm that is primarily lit with LEDs.&nbsp; I have a few high wattage CFLs to supplement the LEDs, but I'm sure they could be replaced by more high wattage LEDs, but the cost is an issue now.&nbsp; High power LEDs are still a few orders of magnitude more expensive than fluorescent.&nbsp; I'm hoping as the technology advances, they'll drop in price.<br />I do know that I'm getting 100% BE on the first flush, while most shiitake farms are getting 70% to 100% over two to three flushes, the substrates remaining in the fruiting area for six weeks or so.&nbsp; This allows me to do one flush and out in two weeks, replacing the spent block with a fresh one, dramatically raising my output per square foot per month.&nbsp; The spent blocks are moved outside where they fruit again for a couple of months without attention.&nbsp; We use these outdoor mushrooms for our own table and to trade with our neighbors for eggs, milk, cheese, beef, and vegetables.&nbsp; Only the indoor mushrooms go to the grocery stores. <br />For those of you who didn't see it already, our <a href=\"http://www.ferrycountyview.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">local newspaper</a> did a front page story on our mushroom farm.&nbsp; Check it out.<br
