yes composted manure is more resistant to molds.&nbsp; That's because molds and bacteria <b>have already eaten most of it</b>.&nbsp; Thus it's more resistant to mushroom mycelium too.&nbsp; One also finds more rhizomorphs on composted manure for a very good reason.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium goes rhizomorhic when it's starving and searching for food.&nbsp; That's why we see more of them on straw, the least nutritious substrate next to composted manure.<br /><br />Two, manure in fields is usually not composted, but you don't 'see' much mold unless you turn it over where there's not as much fresh air.&nbsp; The lesson to learn is that you want lots of fresh air when growing mushrooms.<br /><br />Non-composted, but <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Horse-Manure-Substrate\"
