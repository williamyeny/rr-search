Since I produce a few thousand substrates per month, I get a LOT of metabolites when I 'birth' the substrates.&nbsp; I collect these, mix with water and drain into our vegetable garden, which causes an explosion of growth. <br />Thinking one could add 'nutrients' to a substrate during dunking to obtain extra mushroom growth is akin to thinking one could eat his own excrement and drink his own urine to get extra strength to run a marathon.&nbsp; It just doesn't work that way.<br />RR","title":"Re: Please forgive me if this is a silly
