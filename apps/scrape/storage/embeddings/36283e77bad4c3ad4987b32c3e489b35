mushrooms, Reishi, and Lion's mane, etc., would fruit from the same above-ground downed trees every year, and then these trees would freeze solid all winter.&nbsp; In the spring they'd recover and fruit.&nbsp; In addition, the PNW summers are very dry, with no rain generally from May until September.&nbsp; The same trees would dry totally out and snap like matchsticks, but sure enough, when the fall rains came, the mycelium would again recover and fruit.<br />The above led me to start putting wood in culture slants&nbsp; back in about 1997 or so, and I've noticed it extends the life of the cultures exponentially.&nbsp; Lately, I've noticed nearly every culture vendor has started using wood in their slants.&nbsp; If you take a tissue sample from the agar on a slant with wood and it doesn't take off, reach in and grab the piece of wood itself.&nbsp; It's almost a guarantee that the mycelium in the wood will revive and take off once placed on agar.<br />It's not about nutrients.&nbsp; The agar mix is far more nutritious than the wood.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why do we put wood into master
