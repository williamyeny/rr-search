It's been a long time since someone sent me for a dictionary. Cheers for that. <br />However, I didn't say elderly ladies.&nbsp; I said little girls, and very, very little girls, referring to those too scared to eat more than the amount of mushrooms a church mouse would eat.&nbsp; Maria believed in eating enough mushrooms to have a life-changing experience, and I totally agree.&nbsp; Just be at home or in the woods, but not at a party, or where you have to drive, or otherwise be around people.&nbsp; Dogs make excellent guardians while tripping.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />trip reports</blockquote><br />Trips are private, internal affairs.&nbsp; I don't write trip reports, ever.<br />Additionally, all this talk about B+ this, or GT that, is just nonsense talk.&nbsp; Strains don't come in spores.&nbsp; Every grow from spores is going to generate a different strain, regardless of marketing to the contrary.&nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, many thousands of which emerge from a single swipe of spores.&nbsp; This is why experienced growers learn to isolate strains, and why we banished 'strain' talk to that unmoderated bastard step-child of a 'strain thread' sticky at the top of the page.<br />RR","title":"Re: B+
