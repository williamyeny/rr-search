Sure, you can mist with a bit of baking soda or hydrated lime in the water if you failed to balance the casing layer PH first, but as I said, that isn't the problem.  An acidic casing layer will favor trichoderma and other molds, while mushroom mycelium is more tolerant of basic PH. This is the reason we use lime.  As the mycelium colonizes the substrate, the metabolic byproducts produced begin to swing the PH lower.  By the time pinning starts, you have a near neutral substrate which is what you want.<br /><br />Casing layers pin on the sides for several reasons, but most important to remember, they pin there when that's the best environment for them to form primordia.  The crease between substrate and tray is a perfect microclimate.  It's nice and humid down there and there is plenty of moisture for the substrate to work with.  It's also protected from the spray from the mister, which will damage developing primordia if they get sprayed and are allowed to remain wet.  When the mycelium is actively reaching/colonizing the top of the casing layer, back off on misting.   A sheet of wax paper can be layed on top to hold in the microclimate you're looking for.  It helps to wrinkle it up into a ball, then spread it out again before laying on top of the casing.  These wrinkles will ensure there is plenty of air circulating under the wax paper, while at the same time holding a high humidity level in your mini-environment under the wax paper.<br /><br />It's normal for the substrate to shrink.  It's more than loss of water because the mycelium is actually eating the substrate, therefore it naturally gets smaller over time.<br /><br />At this point, I do not recommend liming the casing layer.  You're trying to make it pin, not suppress trichoderma or other molds.  If it only pins on the sides, you can be assured they'll grow into monsters.  I doubt your total yield will be very much less, although it doesn't look as cool as a wild flush that hides the entire casing layer beneath a forest of mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: side pinning
