Trich will normally ony be in one or two places.  However, whatever type of mold it is, it's bad.  Toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penicillium spores are tiny and seem to get past jar filters.  I know when I was doing some isolates of wild mushrooms away from penicillium, I lost a LOT of colonizing jars of various species that were simply in the same area where the mold was.  They were in quart jars with synthetic filter disks, but still ended up getting the mold anyway.  I think key to avoiding this mold is to get rid of it the very second you see it.  Don't allow it to sit, even if in a filtered jar.  At least some of the spores are bound to escape and screw up your other projects, just like they did mine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7851134</next>\n<prev>7843816</prev>\n<first>7828584</first>\n<last>7887351</last>\n<when>1199743925</when>\n<utime>01/08/08 12:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
