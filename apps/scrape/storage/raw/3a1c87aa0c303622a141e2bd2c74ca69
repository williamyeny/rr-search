{"key":"post-7025811","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7025811</id>\n<content>With multispore inoculation, it's common for two or more strains to make it to fruiting.  They usually combine into a whole via the process of anastomosis, but some strains are incompatible and remain separate.  They don't fight, being that they're the same species.  Fruiting is not impaired either as you can see.  The same often happens when someone injects one side of a cake with one strain, and another side of the cake with a different strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreed, get the cakes off the perlite.  You're lucky they didn't waterlog or waste energy trying to colonize the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7025861</next>\n<prev>7025632</prev>\n<first>7025485</first>\n<last>7028236</last>\n<when>1181400584</when>\n<utime>06/09/07 05:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
