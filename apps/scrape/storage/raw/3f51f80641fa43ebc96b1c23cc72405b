They're usually 18&quot; long and cost less than ten bucks.  Fluorescent lamps emit light at the high(blue) end of the spectrum and produce little heat.  12/12 will give the best results.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6637219</next>\n<prev>6636903</prev>\n<first>6635968</first>\n<last>6643089</last>\n<when>1173114569</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 07:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
