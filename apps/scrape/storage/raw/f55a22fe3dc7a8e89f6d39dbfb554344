Keep a supply of fresh air in your growing chamber and trich will be a rare headache.  I've also found during the summer months when the trich spore load is very high, you can put a bit of hydrated lime in a salt shaker and lightly shake it on the surface of your casing material.  This provides a very high ph zone right were the airborne spores land, preventing germination.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4179149</next>\n<prev>4177064</prev>\n<first>4174082</first>\n<last>4179149</last>\n<when>1116177487</when>\n<utime>05/15/05 08:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
