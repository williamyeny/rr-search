Takes forever!! If your very serious about it I would recommend WBS to anyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally grow bulk myself using rye berries to bulk substrate.&amp;nbsp; However, I challenge you or anyone else to get fruits faster with wbs then I can get with brf tek.&amp;nbsp; There is no faster way to go from spores to fruits.&amp;nbsp; If people make it too wet, or fail to follow the tek in some other fashion, that's their bad, but don't bash the tek.&amp;nbsp; It works, and no other method yet devised will deliver a higher BE than the basic brf tek, and it's the fastest method, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9099162</next>\n<prev>9098937</prev>\n<first>9098673</first>\n<last>9110358</last>\n<when>1224427778</when>\n<utime>10/19/08 05:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
