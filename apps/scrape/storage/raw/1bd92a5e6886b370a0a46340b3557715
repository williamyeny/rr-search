This is why on a hot day, an airplane needs a longer runway to become airborne, engines develop less horsepower, and the density altitude increases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you may be correct in that the molecular weight of the air itself, slightly cooler in the perlite, thus denser and heavier, could be more responsible for the air currents than the pressure gradients.&amp;nbsp; I doubt it could be measured to determine for sure, at least not on my budget. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11502919</next>\n<prev>11501218</prev>\n<first>11499564</first>\n<last>20963185</last>\n<when>1258861939</when>\n<utime>11/22/09 05:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
