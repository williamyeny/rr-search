Soak (bacterial endospore germination)&lt;br /&gt;2. Simmer (as mentioned, NO boiling, a few cracked kernels is okay, but it's best to minimize their numbers)&lt;br /&gt;3. Strain (place your grain in a strainer and run LOTS of cold water over it...tap water is fine)&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisture Content Optimization (Luger suggests drying the rye, which is basically what I do.&amp;nbsp; I personally just keep it in the strainer and shake the hell out of it until hardly ANY water drips when you thrust the strainer downwards and abruptly stop the momentum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things here.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to boil, not simmer the grains after soaking.&amp;nbsp; Rapid boiling does NOT cause the grains to burst.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, never run cold water through the strainer after draining off the boiling water.&amp;nbsp; This will leave the grains too wet if you do.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to drain them hot, and then shake the colander so the grains are tossed around in order to evaporate the steam from them. This will leave you the correct moisture content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see it all demonstrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;rye grain preparation video clip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14130538</next>\n<prev>14128089</prev>\n<first>14127814</first>\n<last>14131674</last>\n<when>1300287609</when>\n<utime>03/16/11 06:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
