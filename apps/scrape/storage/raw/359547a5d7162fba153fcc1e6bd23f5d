If you'll simmer, then pour it into a strainer to drain, you'll notice it only drains for a few minutes at most, then no more water drips out.  Shake it around in the collander to allow the steam to rise off the hot wbs.  It's important for the surface moisture to evaporate off the grains.  That's the reason yours is getting soggy.  Draining overnight as said above does the same thing.  It gives a chance for the surface moisture to dry off the wbs.  Just make sure the grains are dry on the surface before you load your jars and you'll be ok.  The moisture you need is inside the kernel after the soak/simmer-boil.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4573318</next>\n<prev>4572411</prev>\n<first>4571185</first>\n<last>4573421</last>\n<when>1124858534</when>\n<utime>08/24/05 07:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
