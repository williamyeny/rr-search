You would probably get more or less the same result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, gravity has everything to do with fruiting. &lt;a href=&quot;http://anonym.to/?http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11541309&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Here's a research paper&lt;/a&gt; on it for those interested. Mushrooms grow up, opposite gravity.&amp;nbsp; They tend to turn towards the light to orient the caps to absorb as much as possible, but they still want/need the light above and to one side for best results.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown in total darkness will grow straight up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, not a good idea.&amp;nbsp; Light is a pinning trigger to the mycelium, but we also know that fruits very often form on the opposite side of the cake from where the light hits.&amp;nbsp; Placing the cakes upside down is a good idea for two reasons.&amp;nbsp; One, the divot from the bottom of the jar makes a nice place to drop a spoonful of water now and then to keep the cake hydrated during fruiting.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, with some strains, physical shock seems to be a pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; This is part of the reason rinsing cakes vigorously under a faucet and then dunk and roll tends to greatly improve performance. Placing a substrate upside down from the orientation it was in during colonization will often improve performance for the same reason, depending on strain.&amp;nbsp; With some of my shiitake strains, I always put them upside down from the way they colonized.&amp;nbsp; With other strains, I don't bother because it doesn't matter.&amp;nbsp; You'll just have to experiment.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind, I'm speaking of isolates, not multispore inoculated grows.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15411809</next>\n<prev>15410802</prev>\n<first>15410697</first>\n<last>15416320</last>\n<when>1322055182</when>\n<utime>11/23/11 03:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
