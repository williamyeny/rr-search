You're supposed to spray it until wet three times at 12 hour intervals.&amp;nbsp; Spray until all the cobweb mycelium has 'melted' and disappeared.&amp;nbsp; Repeat twice at 12 and 24 hours after the first spray whether you see any cobweb or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also shouldn't be keeping your tray in the dark.&amp;nbsp; Expose to ambient low-level room light from day of inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17906884</next>\n<prev>17906688</prev>\n<first>17906688</first>\n<last>17907267</last>\n<when>1362492721</when>\n<utime>03/05/13 04:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
