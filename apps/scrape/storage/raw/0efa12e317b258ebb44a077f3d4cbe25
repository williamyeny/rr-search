Okay let me explain it to YOU a little better.&lt;br /&gt; Why does it seem that cultivation of Mushrooms is so cut and dry.&lt;br /&gt; With all the experience and all the wisdom and all the people that come here does it seem that I don't know an area of research is missing. hence&amp;nbsp; cut and dry, meaning in a BROAD sense you can't manipulate a mushroom anymore like the thc in bud! That's just one thing but...&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; What about those of us who used to read stories like this &quot;how to grow a pound of mushrooms&quot; or &quot;How to Render the active substance found in Mushrooms&quot; something like that...... I guess If you don't get it then fuck, FORGET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF are you talking about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing growing mushrooms is is cut and dry.&amp;nbsp; We have members here growing thousands of pounds of mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; WTF is this about how to grow a pound?&amp;nbsp; You do that in a terrarium in a few weeks.&amp;nbsp; There have been so many extraction threads, I started locking them.&amp;nbsp; This isn't a drug manufacture board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you trash our members, get your own house in order.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19915879</next>\n<prev>19915842</prev>\n<first>19915696</first>\n<last>19916486</last>\n<when>1398782071</when>\n<utime>04/29/14 05:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
