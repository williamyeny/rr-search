I use a heavy glass dinner plate to hold them submerged in a large kettle of water for 24 hours.  That's the dunk.  The roll is after the dunk, rinse them off under the faucet very well to remove any surface slime, and then 'roll' them in dry vermiculite so that is sticks to it and covers every surface.  After you place it in the terrarium on a piece of foil or jar lid, mist well several times over a few hours to soak the dry verm until it's nice and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn't look like a tapered wide mouth jar.  Good luck getting the cake out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6882975</next>\n<prev>6881303</prev>\n<first>6881178</first>\n<last>6882975</last>\n<when>1178501256</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 04:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
