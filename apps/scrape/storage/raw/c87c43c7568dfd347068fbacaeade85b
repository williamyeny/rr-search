It's composed of long cells, stacked end to end to form a network.  It doesn't take a circulatory system for heavy metals to be absorbed.  Other substances are &lt;i&gt;metabolized&lt;/i&gt; by the mycelium.  That's why mushrooms can grow on manure, but we don't get e coli from eating mushrooms.  However, according to stamets, if there's lead or mercury in the soil, they will absorb it.  I've never personally tested for such.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8046615</next>\n<prev>8045879</prev>\n<first>8042557</first>\n<last>24765371</last>\n<when>1203524043</when>\n<utime>02/20/08 06:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
