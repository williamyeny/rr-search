Don't worry about leaching out nutrients, your mushrooms want what's going to be left anyway, not what washes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use oyster shell flour in both substrates and casing layers.  Crushed oyster shells are sometimes added to casing material for texture, not ph control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to shoot for an initial Ph of near 8.  For this reason, hydrated lime is great.  It works right away so it protects the substrate from mold spore germination while the mushroom mycelium is colonizing, but unable to fend for itself yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum is for the elements, as you said, and as a Ph stabilizer as well.  Gypsum changes Ph very little, but does lower it slightly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6270552</next>\n<prev>6270488</prev>\n<first>6270488</first>\n<last>6270776</last>\n<when>1163221448</when>\n<utime>11/11/06 07:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
