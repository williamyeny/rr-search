Instead, it mixes with the air that comes in, and then flows out mostly through the sides, but also the top due to turbulence caused by the design, which takes advantage of minute pressure differences caused by temperature(evaporative cooling within the perlite). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of a shotgun terrarium is the 'intake', so if there's no holes there, you will have lower humidity and a higher CO2 level because less air is coming in to the terrarium to push the CO2 and stale air out the sides and top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14408056</next>\n<prev>14406373</prev>\n<first>14389423</first>\n<last>14430440</last>\n<when>1304642511</when>\n<utime>05/06/11 03:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
