First, the substrate/casing is heated to 140F, not 160F before the stove is shut off.  Second, it's the easiest, least messy way to pasteurize home-grower amounts of substrate or casing material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that working 12 hour days in my day job, then coming home and trying to grow mushrooms, help out here, and do videos at the same time has taught me, is to use time wisely.  I know of no quicker way to accurately maintain a temperature of 140F to 160F for one hour, then the method I teach.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7575881</next>\n<prev>7575857</prev>\n<first>7570044</first>\n<last>19903068</last>\n<when>1193759166</when>\n<utime>10/30/07 06:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
