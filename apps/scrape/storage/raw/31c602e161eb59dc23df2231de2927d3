In other words, this question gets asked at least once a week and nobody has a definitive answer, including me.  It's whatever you want to do.  It makes little difference until you get into commercial production on a very large scale, where large deep substrates deliver much larger crops, but at the extra expense of more substrate.  In home cultivation, it matters little.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a nomenclature standpoint, remember the casing is only the top layer you put on your substrate.  Your question would most accurately be phrased, &quot;many small substrates, or one large substrate&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6613559</next>\n<prev>6613539</prev>\n<first>6613539</first>\n<last>6613827</last>\n<when>1172537494</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 02:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
