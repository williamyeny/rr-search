The amount of time you have to put into cakes makes it so not worth it. The yield is so bad because the substrate is pretty weak on nutes. Grains is the way to go imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are you &lt;b&gt;flat-out wrong&lt;/b&gt;, but if the guy can't master brf cakes, he doesn't have a chance in hell of mastering a rye or other cereal grain based technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been growing for many years when pf first came out with his cake tek.&amp;nbsp; I resisted it too as 'too easy' and a 'beginner tek' but now I realize it really is a pretty darn good way to grow personal amounts of mushrooms, regardless of skill level or experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know of no substrate with more 'nutes' as they were referred to than brf.&amp;nbsp; It takes about 10 minutes to whip up a batch and another two hours to sterilize them.&amp;nbsp; No other technique will deliver mushrooms in the same timeframe as brf cakes.&amp;nbsp; Experienced growers still use them to prove strains after isolations because they're so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it's all a moot point.&amp;nbsp; We don't allow discussion of dealing here, and those who get into the hobby only for the sake of dealing, haven't a clue about sterile procedure, correct conditions for fruiting, or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun in your next endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8875984</prev>\n<first>8873600</first>\n<last>8876049</last>\n<when>1220543559</when>\n<utime>09/04/08 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
