UPS is even more expensive. If you want to find them locally, go to your local hospital district and ask at the medical lab supply houses.&amp;nbsp; Get 25mm X 125mm as the minimum size.&amp;nbsp; A bit larger is better.&amp;nbsp; I'm getting 35mm X 150mm next time I purchase.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10003905</next>\n<prev>10003529</prev>\n<first>10003087</first>\n<last>10006937</last>\n<when>1237513612</when>\n<utime>03/20/09 04:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
