The cake will absorb far more water if it's held down and the pressure of the water is pushing against it.  Refrigerate during the dunk or place outside if the temps are above freezing, but below normal room temp.  The cool temps prevent bacteria breeding during the dunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, rinse well with tap water, then while dripping wet, roll in dry verm to cover every spot on the cake.  Place in FC and mist well to moisten the dry verm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't birth cakes until one week past full visual colonization.  Dunk for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6634909</next>\n<prev>6634906</prev>\n<first>6634837</first>\n<last>6635431</last>\n<when>1173052931</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 02:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
