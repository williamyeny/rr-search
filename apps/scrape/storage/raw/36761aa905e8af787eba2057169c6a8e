People used to think the mycelium would 'use up nutes' if left after full colonization.&amp;nbsp; We now know that letting the mycelium digest more of the substrate before fruiting leads to a faster and better first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I run my mushroom farm.&amp;nbsp; I leave substrates to consolidate after full colonization for at least a month before introducing to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; The result is a massive first flush, at the end of which I dispose of the substrate to the outdoor garden, and replace it with another.&amp;nbsp; This produces the most product per square foot of fruiting room space per month.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13855680</next>\n<prev>13854608</prev>\n<first>13854512</first>\n<last>13996144</last>\n<when>1296083630</when>\n<utime>01/27/11 01:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
