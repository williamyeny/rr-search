If you add a casing layer, you'll get a better pinset by lowering it to 80% so there will be constant evaporation from the casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colonize at 80F or below because the horse manure will make up to a 5 degrees increase in temperature on its own.  Mid 70's is great for fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5652519</next>\n<prev>5633913</prev>\n<first>5633908</first>\n<last>5652519</last>\n<when>1147736253</when>\n<utime>05/16/06 02:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
