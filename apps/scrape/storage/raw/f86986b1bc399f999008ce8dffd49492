By inoculating and leaving, if contaminants are present, they'll germinate and get a head start on the slower growing mycelium.  I'd wait until you get back to inoculate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, bacteria and molds will be growing along with the mushroom mycelium, and you'll want to be there to make transfers.  Agar isn't for expanding mycelium, so don't allow a dish to grow fully out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8148783</next>\n<prev>8148263</prev>\n<first>8148083</first>\n<last>8148783</last>\n<when>1205584416</when>\n<utime>03/15/08 03:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
