Simply wash with soap and water before use.  You did not define 'box' so we have no idea whether you're talking about a glove box or fruiting chamber.  Either way, sterility is not necessary for either one.  The only purpose of a glovebox is to prevent drafts while you work.  Gloveboxes need not be sterile, and I never use lysol, etc., in mine.  Fruiting chambers also need not be sterile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5585495</next>\n<prev>5585397</prev>\n<first>5585261</first>\n<last>5585704</last>\n<when>1146678446</when>\n<utime>05/03/06 08:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
