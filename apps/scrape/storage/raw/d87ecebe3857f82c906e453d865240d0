{"key":"post-8341255","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8341255</id>\n<content>Agreed.  If the jars have been fully colonized for one week, birth and introduce to fruiting conditions.  Next time, I'd suggest colonizing jars at 75F to 81F.  I've had them fully colonized within a month even at temps in the 50's, so disregard the BS you read that incubators are necessary.  I haven't used one in years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8341272</next>\n<prev>8340648</prev>\n<first>8329517</first>\n<last>8341272</last>\n<when>1209481981</when>\n<utime>04/29/08 06:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
