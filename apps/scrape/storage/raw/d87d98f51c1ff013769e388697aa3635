However, anything from about 15% and above will be fine for your monotubs or shotgun terrariums, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply mist more to make up for it.&amp;nbsp; This isn't a 'problem' as some new growers report, but the way to get best performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point; those KAZ humidifiers from Vicks used to be OK, but they are next to useless for the last five years or so since they sent production outside the US.&amp;nbsp; You're lucky to get a 5% increase in a small room.&amp;nbsp; They used to give that much increase to a whole house.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19312222</next>\n<prev>19310642</prev>\n<first>19310430</first>\n<last>19313161</last>\n<when>1387717911</when>\n<utime>12/22/13 03:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
