He found that to be a massive overdose. Minutes after eating the last one, he called the police on himself in a beshroomed attempt to order an apple by phone. When an ambulance and the cops arrived at his apartment, he was unable to tell them his name or what year it was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part about the fresh alabaster mushrooms on dry ice cracked me up too.&amp;nbsp; We all know you can't freeze mushrooms or they turn to ooze, but somehow he has it on frozen CO2.&amp;nbsp; Obviously he saw John Allen's picture and acted like he found on like it frozen solid. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17803439</prev>\n<first>17801347</first>\n<last>17803451</last>\n<when>1360898981</when>\n<utime>02/15/13 05:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
