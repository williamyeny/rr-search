I've tested 'no fanning' with many species with nice results.&amp;nbsp; Shiitake is hardly effected by no fanning, while oyster mushrooms don't do well at all.&amp;nbsp; Cubensis are generally high CO2 tolerant, but a few fannings each day can greatly cut down on trichoderma contamination, which is stimulated by stale, still air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger, I say fan it every time you think of it, regardless of all the holes.&amp;nbsp; Mist at fannings, and you'll have the best of both worlds-high humidity and lots of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9188578</next>\n<prev>9187433</prev>\n<first>9186375</first>\n<last>9188826</last>\n<when>1225902308</when>\n<utime>11/05/08 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
