Lumens don't matter. Think about it. Shrooms don't grow in open sunshine.&amp;nbsp; Light cycle is most important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disregard nonsense like this.&amp;nbsp; Cubensis grows in Texas and Florida in open cow pastures in direct sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lumens are irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; They're just numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., and mean nothing unless they are delineated over a specific area.(Lux)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lux is an important measure because it refers to the amount of light over a given area. We want very bright light.&amp;nbsp; Watts are a measure of power consumed, but not of the amount of light.&amp;nbsp; The reason we say a 13W to 26W is fine for a terrarium is simply based on experience, but that light fixture must be within a few inches of the terrarium to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mycelium uses light as a source of energy.&amp;nbsp; More light leads to better performance. There is no defined upper limit for light exposure.&amp;nbsp; When I grew in a room with 4000K metal halide 400 watt lamps, performance was better than with 6500K CFL lamps. The latter had a closer color temp to ideal, but the former made up for it with intensity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20265963</next>\n<prev>20265435</prev>\n<first>20265116</first>\n<last>20265975</last>\n<when>1405256947</when>\n<utime>07/13/14 04:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
