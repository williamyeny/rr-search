{"key":"post-6065358","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6065358</id>\n<content>&quot;Does anyone know what would be an optimal temp range to initiate pinning with Azures? &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 40F.  I wouldn't recommend Azures for an indoor project.  Start them indoors, but transfer them outdoors to fruit.  They don't fruit well indoors on sterilized substrates/casings, requiring the plethoria of organisms in the soil to do well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6065439</next>\n<prev>6065064</prev>\n<first>6058913</first>\n<last>6065439</last>\n<when>1158358568</when>\n<utime>09/16/06 01:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
