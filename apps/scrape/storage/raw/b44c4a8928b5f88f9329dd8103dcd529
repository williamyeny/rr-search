{"key":"post-15162256","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>15162256</id>\n<content>What I was saying is this: For a given amount of spawn,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make one tub at a 1:1 ratio, or ten tubs at a 1:10 ratio, you will have used the same amount of spawn, but your results will give more total product on the latter.&amp;nbsp; BE will be lower on the latter as well, but total harvest will be more.&amp;nbsp; This is what is meant by a point of diminishing returns, not that using a lower spawn rate is inferior, provided one pasteurizes properly and gets the substrate colonized before contamination takes over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes no difference if one is growing commercially or not.&amp;nbsp; Getting maximum product per pound of spawn is simply getting maximum product.&amp;nbsp; Also remember, cubensis is a great training species for more advanced work later on, but don't think you're going to be keeping those training wheels bolted to your bike forever.&amp;nbsp; I know of very few growers who only grew cubensis ten years ago who even care one whit about them today.&amp;nbsp; If one is seriously into the psilocybes, there's far better species to grow than cubes. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15162941</next>\n<prev>15161222</prev>\n<first>15146819</first>\n<last>16478879</last>\n<when>1317493639</when>\n<utime>10/01/11 09:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
