Never put an alcohol lamp inside a glovebox.  Keep it on the outside.  The lamp will use up the oxygen inside, causing fresh air to be drawn in, defeating the purpose of the glovebox.  The heat from the lamp also causes turbulence inside the glovebox, which is another bad thing.  Just cut a couple of arm holes in the side so you can remove your hands to use the lamp outside the box, then while the tool/needle is still red hot, move it back inside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6519665</next>\n<prev>6519627</prev>\n<first>6519605</first>\n<last>6521952</last>\n<when>1170355615</when>\n<utime>02/01/07 08:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
