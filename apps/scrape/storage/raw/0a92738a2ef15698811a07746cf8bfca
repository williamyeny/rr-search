However, part of experimenting is reporting the results accurately, even if they don't match what we 'thought' would happen.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to all, and never be afraid to try something just because it's weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/3026655#3026655&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/3026655#30266&lt;wbr&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! There's nothing wrong with experimenting. It's how we all learn, and how the whole log tek came to be in the first place. . . . .People need to lighten up. I like it when guys experiment and have the courtesy to post their results, good or bad. If someone improves on the straw log tek, my hat is off to them. There's always a better way to do something, but if we never experiment, we never learn. Rock on mr.

After a year of flames from people claiming that &quot;Coir has NO nutes&quot;, somebody else finally tried it, and then somebody else, and so on. Experimenting is how we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, a little more to the point from the current trolling from the previous link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be really nice for a change to see someone actually experiment and then report the results, rather than endless posts about 'will this work?' or 'will that work?' and then arguing about it. Just do it. If you really want to experiment, try something that hasn't already been tried a thousand times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could post a thousand more links, but that's enough.&amp;nbsp; To claim falsely that there's some sort of &lt;b&gt;totalitarian nature&lt;/b&gt; here is just plain and simple telling a lie.&amp;nbsp; Nothing is further from the truth. I've always rabidly encouraged experimentation, but what we object to is lazy-asses who argue a point that has been long disproved by tens of thousands of growers, and then tell others to go out and do their research for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grow up or go away.&amp;nbsp; This sort of childish paranoia is not welcome here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15544563</next>\n<prev>15544196</prev>\n<first>15539064</first>\n<last>15546981</last>\n<when>1324397705</when>\n<utime>12/20/11 06:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
