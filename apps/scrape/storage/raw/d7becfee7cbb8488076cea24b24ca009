Of course I knew the answer before posting the original pic.  You don't think I'd post my failures do you? The o'lady doesn't even get to see those! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions about hormones aside, one thing this experiment does show is the aggressive cloning quality of pins.  These pins were not sterile by any means, yet they were layed on the agar and the rapidly expanding mycelium simply overran any bacteria or molds that may have been present.  You wouldn't get that same performance from a large fruit that was fully mature.  Of course, I would never transfer those sections to grains because of dormant contaminant spores that may be present.  Instead, a small piece of mycelium from the leading edge should be transferred to a new dish, which once grown out for a few days can then inoculate up to ten quart jars, or be transferred to LC to grow out the isolated strain for even larger inoculations.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5704245</next>\n<prev>5704131</prev>\n<first>5703541</first>\n<last>5708903</last>\n<when>1149277219</when>\n<utime>06/02/06 10:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
