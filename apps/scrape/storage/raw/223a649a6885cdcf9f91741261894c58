Even with the SGFC built to his specs, it still needs to be fanned multiple times a day for sufficient FAE. Thats my dilema. Im not trying to find out how to build a proper FC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick search will reveal that when I designed the shotgun terrarium I was working 12 hour shifts, an hour drive from home.&amp;nbsp; This resulted in being gone 14 hours per day, with no way to perform fanning or misting.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A double outlet 100 gallon aquarium pump in a shotgun terrarium will result in about ten percent of the air exchange you would get naturally, plus destroy the flow of air up through the perlite, causing all sorts of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollow stems and poor potency are not FAE or humidity related, so instead of fixing what isn't broken, lower the temp to prevent hollow stems and isolate proper genetics to get the potency you desire.&amp;nbsp; You will never get consistent potency when growing from spores.&amp;nbsp; Every grow is like a roll of the dice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15314409</prev>\n<first>15313289</first>\n<last>15314427</last>\n<when>1320280612</when>\n<utime>11/03/11 03:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
