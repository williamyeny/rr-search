Perlite does not form into a sponge like material, vermiculite does.  Vermiculite absorbs water, perlite does not.  Perlite works by having a very large surface area, to which the water sticks and than evaporates off.  The water does not penetrate the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture will evaporate just fine from perlite at room temperature, and three to five inches of rinsed, and then well drained perlite in a tub will maintain humidity for six to eight weeks, sometimes longer without adding more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6897520</next>\n<prev>6896132</prev>\n<first>6893786</first>\n<last>6899180</last>\n<when>1178810519</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 06:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
