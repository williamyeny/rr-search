Bleach is ineffective against molds.  It will kill the spores, but not live molds, so be careful.  It won't do squat for cobweb which spreads by mycelial fragments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you bleach bomb, shut OFF all fans and leave the room totally still so the bleach fog can go to work on spores and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oust is effective against airborne bacteria.  Lysol is 80% alcohol, so will kill molds, virii and bacteria on surfaces, but is seriously overpriced for a small can of alcohol with only 1/10 of 1% ammonium saccharinate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I've found to clean a room is to fog with oust or ten percent bleach, then after fifteen minutes, run the flowhood for an hour before starting work.  Doing this, I've been able to leave a petri dish open for several minutes away from the flowhood without introducing contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5834666</next>\n<prev>5834599</prev>\n<first>5834354</first>\n<last>5841173</last>\n<when>1152376511</when>\n<utime>07/08/06 07:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
