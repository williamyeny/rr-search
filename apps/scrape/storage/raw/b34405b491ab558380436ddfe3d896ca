If you live in the desert, you'll of course need to mist more often than someone that lives in a damp climate. However, even in Seattle, I used to mist a few times daily.  If it's extremely dry in your house, run a coolmist humidifier in the room the fruiting chamber is located.  If you get the ambient room humidity up to 50% or so, this design will perform perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8360500</prev>\n<first>8357629</first>\n<last>8360660</last>\n<when>1209912016</when>\n<utime>05/04/08 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
