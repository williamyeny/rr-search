They had the rack pulled out half way and had the jars sitting on them. Do you think this is a safe way to sterilize and a BETTER way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there was a complete idiot a few years ago who thought the hot air would sterilize mold spores miraculously during inoculations without burning the skin off his hands and arms.&amp;nbsp; He posted it and people for some reason are still repeating that nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What actually happens is the convection from the oven causes MORE air flow and turbulence and increases contamination rates.&amp;nbsp; The heat isn't enough to kill the mold and bacteria, but it is enough to blow a shit ton of them on your work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably couldn't find the 'tek' because I deleted it some time ago because it kept screwing up people's grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13787662</next>\n<prev>13786555</prev>\n<first>13786490</first>\n<last>13787662</last>\n<when>1295054617</when>\n<utime>01/15/11 03:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
