That means a 12 X 24 should require 200 to 300 cfm @ 1&quot; static pressure, and 24 X 24 should use a 400 to 600 cfm @ 1&quot; static pressure blower, assuming no losses.  You can add 10% to cover friction, etc. Be sure to either use a motor speed controller, or easier yet, just block part of the intake of the squirrel cage if you need to cut down the flow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7125282</prev>\n<first>7123359</first>\n<last>7125787</last>\n<when>1183511634</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 04:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
