Exactly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because rice won't hold as much water as vermiculite and growing mushrooms is as much about water as 'nutrients'.  In other words, a jar of brown rice won't fruit nearly as well as a jar with 1/3 rice flour and 2/3 verm.  That's a fact.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7608802</next>\n<prev>7608529</prev>\n<first>6631280</first>\n<last>7608802</last>\n<when>1194489569</when>\n<utime>11/08/07 04:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
