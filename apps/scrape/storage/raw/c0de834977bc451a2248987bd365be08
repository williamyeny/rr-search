Grow them out and find out. If they have spindly stocks I would almost bet my virginity that they are Cyans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;P cyanescens&lt;/i&gt;, doesn't grow on manure and it sure as hell doesn't fruit in August.&amp;nbsp; They're also more potent than &lt;i&gt;P azurescens&lt;/i&gt;, despite claims to the contrary.&amp;nbsp; Those of us who pick both and have for many years know better.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I don't even like the trip qualities of azures.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;P cyanescens&lt;/i&gt; is much better, but you better be looking in the Pacific Northwest if you're in the US.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13104764</next>\n<prev>13104722</prev>\n<first>13104634</first>\n<last>13105104</last>\n<when>1282841045</when>\n<utime>08/26/10 07:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
