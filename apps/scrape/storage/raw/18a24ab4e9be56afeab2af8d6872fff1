Other species may differ.  Personally, I've given up on using aluminum trays for mushroom growing for just this reason.  Why spend $2 to $5 per tray for one or two uses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll move this over to cultivation.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8306434</next>\n<prev>8299217</prev>\n<first>8229689</first>\n<last>8540816</last>\n<when>1208665542</when>\n<utime>04/20/08 07:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
