{"key":"post-6618803","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6618803</id>\n<content>It's really not about jars breaking, although sometimes they will.  here is the reason:  At 15psi, the temperature in your PC and inside the jars is 250F.  If you quick cool the PC, the substrate or whatever is in your jars is still at 250F, but now the pressure is gone.  As we all know, water boils at 212f at sea level pressure.  That means that the moisture in your jars will boil off.  It will continue to boil off until the temperature of the substrate cools below 212F.  There's an excellent chance that you will have destroyed the moisture content you worked hard to get right before sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you quick cool with bags, the filter won't expel the steam fast enough, so the bags inflate and burst, spilling whatever is in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the instructions say you can quick cool, you must bear in mind they don't build PC's for mushroom growers.  They build them for kitchen food use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6618715</prev>\n<first>6618519</first>\n<last>6618803</last>\n<when>1172644298</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 08:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
