Other growers use different procedures, but all of them involve getting the grains to the correct moisture content and then sterilizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endospores do not need to germinate to be killed.&amp;nbsp; Stinky, fermented grains will have far more endospores than the original dry grain simply because &lt;i&gt;endospore forming bacteria will begin to form new endospores within hours of germination.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Simply hydrate the grains before pressure cooking for at least 4 hours.&amp;nbsp; When the grains are hydrated, the hard shell of the endospore is also hydrated, thus it will easily be nuked in the pressure cooker whether it has germinated or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18958299</next>\n<prev>18958233</prev>\n<first>18955350</first>\n<last>19009255</last>\n<when>1381413650</when>\n<utime>10/10/13 05:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
