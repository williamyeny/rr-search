{"key":"post-6977962","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6977962</id>\n<content>What about the other jars?  Was there only one that showed no growth?  A 10ml syringe will inoculate at least 10 pf jars, so how did the other nine fare?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always flame the needle, and then almost immediately inject.  This ensures the needle is clean and contaminant free.  The first drop of solution might sizzle a bit, but then the rest can flow unimpeded and sterile.  Flame between each jar, but not between holes in the same jar.  This prevents cross-contamination should the sterilization process not have been complete in one or two jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth is usually noticable within a week.  Many experienced growers have their jars fully colonized after two to three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6978007</next>\n<prev>6977620</prev>\n<first>6977294</first>\n<last>6980728</last>\n<when>1180382434</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 11:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
