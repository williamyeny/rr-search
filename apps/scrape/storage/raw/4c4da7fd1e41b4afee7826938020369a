{"key":"post-5766838","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5766838</id>\n<content>Correct.  Contaminants in jars are caused by unsterile technique.  Contaminants in grow chambers are generally caused by lack of air exchange.  There is no need to keep a grow chamber sterile.  Just be clean.  A lot of new growers fail to make that distinction.  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5767491</next>\n<prev>5766713</prev>\n<first>5766713</first>\n<last>5768148</last>\n<when>1150714618</when>\n<utime>06/19/06 01:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
