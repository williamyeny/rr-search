They fruit better in the low 80's, so temperature needs to stay high.  They prefer manure based substrates, no more than 1 1/2&quot; thick.  Thicker substrates perform poorly, if at all.  Use peat/verm/sand casing no more than 1/4&quot; thick.  Don't worry if the entire casing colonizes.   Wax paper layed over the top after casiing colonization will help stimulate pinning.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6034850</next>\n<prev>6034842</prev>\n<first>6034819</first>\n<last>6042016</last>\n<when>1157564810</when>\n<utime>09/06/06 08:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
