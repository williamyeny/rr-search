How long did it take a mod to see this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen expert, we try very hard to &lt;b&gt;moderate&lt;/b&gt; threads here, not police or shut them down.  If I have to shut it down, I will.  I also try hard to fix what's broken before bringing down the ban hammer.  Usually a pm to an offending person will set things straight.  Other times not, but the staff is here and watching.  If we leave it up, we get bitched at for being PART-TIME, if we shut it down, ten other people would bitch that we're censoring information.  What gives?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7683899</next>\n<prev>7683863</prev>\n<first>7664184</first>\n<last>7704588</last>\n<when>1196143497</when>\n<utime>11/27/07 08:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
