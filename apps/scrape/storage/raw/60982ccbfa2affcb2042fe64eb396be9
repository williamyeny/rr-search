You should let them air dry after the simmer to evaporate the moisture off the surface.  Some growers who soak but don't simmer, use a towel.  Just make sure the exterior of the grains are dry when you load the jars.  The moisture you want will be inside the kernels provided you've soaked and/or simmered until the grains are double the original size from when they came out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6383760</next>\n<prev>6383442</prev>\n<first>6383177</first>\n<last>6384655</last>\n<when>1166477791</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 11:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
