For years, I recommended tossing out contaminated jars because the fossil energy and other costs of sterilization outweigh the cost of buying new jars.&amp;nbsp; Each grower has to weigh the costs of sterilization vs new jars to see which is the better path to follow.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main rule is don't open the jars until they've been neutralized.&amp;nbsp; You can do it by dropping the jar into a large pot of water and boiling for an hour or two.&amp;nbsp; You don't even need the PC for this.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11411072</next>\n<prev>11410432</prev>\n<first>11405748</first>\n<last>11421917</last>\n<when>1257707146</when>\n<utime>11/08/09 09:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
