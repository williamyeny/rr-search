Lime as you would coir or peat, as the Ph is similar.  You can even grow on 100% coffee grinds if you want, as there is no set ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems your ratio of hydrated lime might be a bit high.  You can safely use half as much hydrated lime on manure as you would on coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6281696</prev>\n<first>6281696</first>\n<last>6281809</last>\n<when>1163522020</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
