Since you have access to all age ranges there, perhaps you can do a test project with the very old composted manure, and another tray with the middle age nuggets that have turned grey and dried out, but are still intact and not composted.  I've heard that the fully composted manure that looks like soil doesn't work as well, but I've never tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure any sawdust/woodchips mixed in are not cedar.  If so, you need to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6042932</next>\n<prev>6042735</prev>\n<first>6042735</first>\n<last>6045247</last>\n<when>1157778457</when>\n<utime>09/09/06 08:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
