Usually the pins don't abort, but if they do, more will follow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Holesnype said, the dry verm isn't supposed to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, use 1/2 pints, because they perform better.  If you want larger cakes, stack them after birthing. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8444504</next>\n<prev>8444008</prev>\n<first>8443432</first>\n<last>8446757</last>\n<when>1211755502</when>\n<utime>05/26/08 01:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
