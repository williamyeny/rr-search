{"key":"post-7698215","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7698215</id>\n<content>After building a straw log, you need to cut slits all around the outside edge, every two to four inches.  Make sure at least a couple of these slits are on the very bottom, so the excess water can drain out over the first few days after spawning.  I usually leave a tray under the log to catch the drips.  After two days or so, no more water drips out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7698243</next>\n<prev>7698180</prev>\n<first>7698180</first>\n<last>7698243</last>\n<when>1196442179</when>\n<utime>11/30/07 07:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
