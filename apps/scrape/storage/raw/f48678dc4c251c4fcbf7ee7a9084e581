{"key":"post-19980357","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>19980357</id>\n<content>There's a few things to remember here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A casing layer creates lots of small air pockets on the surface which are conducive to pin formation.&amp;nbsp; A layer of wax paper or similar material will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mention 'a few mistings due to dry climate'.&amp;nbsp; This is poor procedure.&amp;nbsp; You should be providing enough air exchange that you must mist a few times per day, even if you live in a rain-soaked jungle.&amp;nbsp; This is why your cased trays did better than the non-cased ones.&amp;nbsp; Your conditions were specifically tailored to favor casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disregard so-called 'tests' where someone cased half a tray and left the other half uncased.&amp;nbsp; I've seen those too.&amp;nbsp; The cased side always fruits and the uncased side never does.&amp;nbsp; This is because the uncased side dries out, so the fruits form where it's suitable. It's the same principle of leaving a tray too dry and then noticing the fruits only form around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this again while maintaining conditions on all trays via proper misting and you'll see even performance on all.&amp;nbsp; What it does tell us is what we've known for a long time; that a casing layer allows one to grow mushrooms with less maintenance. This is beneficial for those who need to be gone for a day or three at a time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19980368</next>\n<prev>19980307</prev>\n<first>19979607</first>\n<last>20946217</last>\n<when>1399987823</when>\n<utime>05/13/14 04:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
