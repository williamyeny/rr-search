The ants suck up the karo with the borax in it, then take it back to the nest to mix into the feed.  Within two weeks, the entire colony including the queens is wiped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ex-mother in law never had cockroachs in her house, even though all the neighbors did, and she never had the place sprayed.  Her trick was to buy cucumbers, slice them up and lay the slices around the house in areas where roaches would hang out, such as under the sink, stove, refrigerator, bathroom, etc.  She swore it worked, and the proof was in the pudding.
