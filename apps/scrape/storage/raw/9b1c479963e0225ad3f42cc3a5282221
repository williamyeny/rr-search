{"key":"post-5653021","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5653021</id>\n<content>A cool mist by itself 24/7 is serious overkill for a greenhouse as small as a martha.  The ultrasonic is adding insult to injury to your poor soaking wet pins, so get rid of it.  If the pins stay wet for very long, they will abort. That's why in a terrarium, we fan like hell after misting to dry off the wetness from the pins.  I only run my cool mist one minute on, six minutes off to maintain 90% humidity.  More than that is going to get your casing layers wet and abort your pins.  Another pin aborter in a greenhouse type setup is when you have too much mist and it builds up on the shelves themselves, then drips to the casing layer on the next shelf below.  These very large drops of now dirty water will abort pins very fast.  Make sure there are no drips over your casings.  If so, fix them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5653046</next>\n<prev>5652978</prev>\n<first>5652978</first>\n<last>5653124</last>\n<when>1148146006</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 08:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
