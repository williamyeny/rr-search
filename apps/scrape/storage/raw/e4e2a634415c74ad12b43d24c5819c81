In my opinion, the costs of failure even if only 10% of the time, are far more than the care required for repeated success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the no-soak, no-rinse grain prep method, that's what was described in Stamets' The Mushroom Cultivator published in the 80s.&amp;nbsp; Since that time, we've developed better ways of doing grains that result in less sticking and clumping together, but that doesn't mean the old methods don't still work.&amp;nbsp; I wish the best of luck to all, regardless of the methods you use.&amp;nbsp; It's all good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8683978</next>\n<prev>8682098</prev>\n<first>8662735</first>\n<last>8699171</last>\n<when>1217083344</when>\n<utime>07/26/08 05:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
