The bruising where you cut a mushroom is normal and the  bruised fruits are safe to eat.  The cake is bluing at the top because you probably held it there when you picked the mushrooms off.  If you touch a cake in any way, it can bruise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick the mushrooms as they're ready.  There's no need or reason to pick them all at once.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6321264</next>\n<prev>6319527</prev>\n<first>6319527</first>\n<last>6321264</last>\n<when>1164865888</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 07:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
