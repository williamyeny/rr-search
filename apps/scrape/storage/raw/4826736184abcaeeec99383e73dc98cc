I'll pour them in a brand new, large zip-lock bag, and break it into small pieces. This will be done in a sterile environment. I'll then put 3 tablespoons of the &quot;BRF&quot; mix into the sterilized wild bird seed. I'm surprised your advising people on how to grow if you haven't even heard of this tek. It's very well known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have a verm filter on the brf jars you'll be using as donor jars?&amp;nbsp; If so, it will contaminate your receiving jars.&amp;nbsp; It's awfully hard to scrape it off without getting any contaminant spores on the brf mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll still need gas exchange after the transfer, so drill holes in the lid and use a filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14384637</next>\n<prev>14384229</prev>\n<first>14382368</first>\n<last>14386776</last>\n<when>1304301055</when>\n<utime>05/02/11 04:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
