Before starting, measure and mark 1cm from the rim of the jars. This is the stopping point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better check the math.&amp;nbsp; That ain't right.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're anywhere but the US, stick to metrics.&amp;nbsp; If you're in the US, use either one, but you'll get messed up if you try to measure one in cups and the other in ml.&amp;nbsp; The recipe is 1-1-2, brown rice flour(or rice bran-better), water, vermiculite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fill the jars to the bottom of the threads on the 1/2 pint wide mouth mason jars, and top off with dry verm all the way to the top, and then about 2mm past the top, because it's going to settle when you tap the sides of the jars with your hand or a wooden spoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10152796</next>\n<prev>10149537</prev>\n<first>10149158</first>\n<last>10152796</last>\n<when>1239512954</when>\n<utime>04/12/09 08:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
