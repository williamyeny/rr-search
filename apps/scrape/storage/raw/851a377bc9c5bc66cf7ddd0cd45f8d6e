You're most likely running a hose from the humidifier, which creates a very small amount of static pressure, forcing wet, misty air into the motor bushings.  Run the humidifier without any modifications and it will stay quiet for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't believe in using a mechanical device prone to failure for air exchanage.  Just leave your door or lid loose for constant air exchange.  Use a humidifier for humidity in a greenhouse or perlite to maintain humidity in a terrarium unless your casing bulk substrates which will make enough humidity on their own in a terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5620855</next>\n<prev>5620295</prev>\n<first>5620295</first>\n<last>5620855</last>\n<when>1147443448</when>\n<utime>05/12/06 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
