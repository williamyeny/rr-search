Light at the higher end of the spectrum such as fluorescent is far better than light at the lower end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more disinformation in this thread than you'll find at church on Sunday.&amp;nbsp; The fluorescent lamp Appalachian Guy posted above will work great.&amp;nbsp; 12/12 is preferred, but also as said above, timing isn't critical.&amp;nbsp; Turn it on when you get up in the mornings, and turn it off when you get home from work and you'll be fine.&amp;nbsp; If you have a timer, set it for 12/12 and forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are satisfied with one or two mushrooms can use incandescent, moonlight or a bic lighter.&amp;nbsp; Those who want wall to wall flushes or cakes covered in mushrooms will do well to heed the advice of those who have tried everything already.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9121791</next>\n<prev>9121617</prev>\n<first>9121291</first>\n<last>9138982</last>\n<when>1224795361</when>\n<utime>10/23/08 11:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
