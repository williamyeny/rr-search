From what I've read this is due to the RH being higher in the lower part of the FC. Is this correct?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it isn't.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes they turn toward the perlite because it's reflecting light, and they grow towards light.&amp;nbsp; If it looks like the cap is going to go into the perlite, slip a small piece of foil in the way to keep the cap clean.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12834713</prev>\n<first>12834669</first>\n<last>12835336</last>\n<when>1278022715</when>\n<utime>07/02/10 01:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
