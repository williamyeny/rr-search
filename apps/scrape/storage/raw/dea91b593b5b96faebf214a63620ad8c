Cold shocking involves lowering the temperature for several days, not overnight.  We dunk in the refrigerator, or under slowly running water to help prevent bacterial blooms in the anaerobic environment of your submerged substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6342547</next>\n<prev>6342448</prev>\n<first>6340901</first>\n<last>6342547</last>\n<when>1165467322</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 06:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
