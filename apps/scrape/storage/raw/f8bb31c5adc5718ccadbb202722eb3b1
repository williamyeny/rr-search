I was an apprenticeship instructor with the IBEW for over 20 years.&amp;nbsp; My degree is in electrical engineering and my specialty during my working career was industrial automation and robotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, growing mushrooms on a small scale doesn't lend itself to automation.&amp;nbsp; Capacitance sensors don't do well in very high humidity applications, and timers to control humidifiers must be constantly tweaked as the ambient conditions change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the reason I designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's based on the 'automated' refrigeration units that keep the support structures frozen in place on the Alaska Pipeline.&amp;nbsp; If they thawed out EVER, they'd shift, which would rupture the pipe, resulting in an oil spill.&amp;nbsp; Even though it was designed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s it still stands as an engineering marvel, and to this day I'm proud to have been a part of that project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your robotics skills for robotics.&amp;nbsp; For mushroom growing, the shotgun terrarium is as automated as it gets, since nature makes it work.&amp;nbsp; It takes eyeballs to know when and how much to mist, so don't try to automate that procedure.&amp;nbsp; Besides, you need to be inspecting your grow area a few times daily for molds.&amp;nbsp; If you get complacent with automation, you might go a few days without inspecting and then your whole area could be compromised with trich.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12934568</next>\n<prev>12934122</prev>\n<first>12919531</first>\n<last>12986003</last>\n<when>1279809978</when>\n<utime>07/22/10 05:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
