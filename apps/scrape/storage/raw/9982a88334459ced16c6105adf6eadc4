When you salt it in one place, it will pop up in another shortly.  All you're doing is salting what's on the surface.  Most of the organism is in the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is for casing layers.  If you're growing on sawdust-woodchip blocks, salt paste can be used anytime you see trich, which is usually just on the surface.  Last year, I filmed a video tek for salting straw logs and substrate blocks, but there wasn't room for it on my DVD.  Perhaps I'll post it to youtube.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7704945</next>\n<prev>7703000</prev>\n<first>7702648</first>\n<last>7710521</last>\n<when>1196546742</when>\n<utime>12/02/07 12:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
