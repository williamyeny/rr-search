If it gets too bad, you can get a self contained refrigeration unit.  They sell them in hardware and home megacenters.  They use a 4&quot; dryer hose to vent the condenser fan heat to the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For terrarium type FC's just move it closer to your AC unit, or put blue ice packs in it a few times a day, rotating them from your freezer.  Lights shouldn't raise the heat.  Use fluorescent lighting a few feet away from the FC and there won't be any heat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6926187</next>\n<prev>6926105</prev>\n<first>6926100</first>\n<last>6927454</last>\n<when>1179360160</when>\n<utime>05/17/07 03:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
