{"key":"post-6548241","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6548241</id>\n<content>Rye works much better cased than wbs.  WBS needs to be spawned to bulk, but rye fruits well simply cased. Of course yields are higher if you spawn to bulk, but you double the time to harvest, so it's all a trade off.  I've seen no evidence that potency is related to choice of spawn or substrate.  It's a (sub)strain trait.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6548311</next>\n<prev>6548025</prev>\n<first>6547176</first>\n<last>6548385</last>\n<when>1171066997</when>\n<utime>02/10/07 02:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
