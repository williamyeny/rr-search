If it gets green mold before first flush, it usually indicates the spawn was contaminated, and it will be throughout the substrate.  The green is the spores and you don't want to do anything to disturb them, which releases them into the air.  Toss out the tray without digging into it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6602274</next>\n<prev>6601047</prev>\n<first>6600891</first>\n<last>6602274</last>\n<when>1172250253</when>\n<utime>02/23/07 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
