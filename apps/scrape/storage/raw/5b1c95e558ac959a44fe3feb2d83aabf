Toss them out.  Properly made pf jars should colonize in two weeks, three max.  If they take longer than that, something is wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put some manure or straw in a hole in a shady part of your back yard and mix the cakes in with that, then cover with a 1/2&quot; layer of soil.  Often they'll recover and fruit normally outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6730880</next>\n<prev>6727983</prev>\n<first>6726956</first>\n<last>6758710</last>\n<when>1175287521</when>\n<utime>03/30/07 11:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
