Hygrometers only have about a 20% range that they're accurate, so for our uses, you want it calibrated at 99%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger, so uncover those holes, and simply run a cool mist in your room as required.&amp;nbsp; This will also make you feel better and your houseplants will also do much better.&amp;nbsp; This is also important for those of you in snowy or extremely cold climates in winter when you have super low ambient humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9007857</next>\n<prev>9003182</prev>\n<first>9002650</first>\n<last>9007857</last>\n<when>1222740577</when>\n<utime>09/30/08 05:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
