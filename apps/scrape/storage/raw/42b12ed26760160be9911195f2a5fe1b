Personally, I no longer use peroxide in the humidifier, but I can assure you that isn't the problem.  Peroxide in the humidifier only serves to help control molds within the humidifier itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green mold spores are in the air everywhere.  The key to preventing them from growing in the grow room is good air circulation.  Trichoderma requires still, stale air.  Mushrooms want, moving, fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6366101</next>\n<prev>6366040</prev>\n<first>6366031</first>\n<last>6366455</last>\n<when>1166041177</when>\n<utime>12/13/06 10:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
