You're supposed to &lt;i&gt;pasteurize&lt;/i&gt; the coir at 140F to 160F for an hour, not simply hydrate with warm water.  I'm sure that water cooled off below 140F by the time the block was even half way hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, use a meat thermometer and make sure the center of the fully hydrated substrates maintains 140F to 160F for a full hour.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8476121</next>\n<prev>8475914</prev>\n<first>8475914</first>\n<last>8477639</last>\n<when>1212452569</when>\n<utime>06/03/08 03:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
