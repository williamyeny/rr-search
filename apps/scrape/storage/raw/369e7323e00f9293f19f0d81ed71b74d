Coir comes out of the package washed a few times and probably practically sterile already. Put it through a PC cycle in the agar broth and I'd be amazed to find any critters surviving on it. They don't even like to grow on it when it's wet and sitting around in the open air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why it shouldn't be used, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On agar, we &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;want&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; contaminant spores to germinate and grow so we can transfer healthy mycelium away from it.&amp;nbsp; If you have a medium that contaminant spores don't germinate, they're preserved intact until you transfer to grains, and then they ruin your day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, agar isn't for expanding mycelium.&amp;nbsp; It's for cleaning up from contaminants to get a pure culture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14082645</next>\n<prev>14082540</prev>\n<first>14068294</first>\n<last>14083013</last>\n<when>1299545741</when>\n<utime>03/08/11 02:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
