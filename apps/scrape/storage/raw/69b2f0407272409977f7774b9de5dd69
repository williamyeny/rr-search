However, pickling lime in the grocery store is calcium carbonate and works great.  Pet stores also have calcium carbonate in granular form for reptiles, as well as oyster shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, gypsum is an excellent source of calcium, but it also has sulphur(both necessary for good fruiting) so it doesn't change the ph much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can order hydrated lime by second day air at the link below. Just do a search on their site for hydrated lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4657804</next>\n<prev>4657492</prev>\n<first>4657404</first>\n<last>4657804</last>\n<when>1126677031</when>\n<utime>09/14/05 08:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
