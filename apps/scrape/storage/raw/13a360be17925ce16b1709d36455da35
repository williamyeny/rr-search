The name on a sporeprint or syringe means little.  That's a mycological fact.  The isolate you create, or the substrain that emerges from multispore inculation by the roll of the dice is what is going to matter, not the name somebody gave it, or the reigon the sporeprint was collected in.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few exceptions, such as penis envy, but for the rest, one could easily isolate similar performing strains from any print.  It's not like growing pot where the named strain means everything because if it's stable, the offspring will be substantially similar.  Such is not the case with mushrooms, and that is why we restrict discussion of 'strains' to the stickied STRAIN THREAD at the very top of this page.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6552391</next>\n<prev>6552380</prev>\n<first>6551792</first>\n<last>6552391</last>\n<when>1171168950</when>\n<utime>02/11/07 06:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
