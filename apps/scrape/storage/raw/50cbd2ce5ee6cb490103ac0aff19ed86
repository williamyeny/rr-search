I get accused of being on a power trip at least twice a week for moving pf tek questions to this forum from &lt;b&gt;advanced mycology&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would take someone at least a year to go through the boards and delete all the bad information posted here.&amp;nbsp; Most of the 'teks' were written by first time growers who wanted to see their name in print.&amp;nbsp; Often, what they did worked in spite of their efforts, rather than because of them, yet they posted it as a tek and there it still is, even though they've long since lost interest and gone back to sniffing glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did delete the 'oven tek' the other day because it had screwed up hundreds, perhaps thousands of new growers projects.&amp;nbsp; I have accurate info in my videos, so link to them often rather than type the same exact answer over and over and over again. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9817849</next>\n<prev>9817787</prev>\n<first>9816811</first>\n<last>9832755</last>\n<when>1234939495</when>\n<utime>02/18/09 08:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
