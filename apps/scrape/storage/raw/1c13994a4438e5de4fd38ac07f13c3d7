Spend about two weeks reading every single post on this board for at least the last 50 to 100 pages.  There's a ton of information to read and digest before you get started.  You still don't understand the difference between incubation and fruiting, so read up.  You don't heat terrariums, and you don't set cakes on the glass bottom.  Good luck, and read, read, read.  It's the fastest way to learn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6873429</next>\n<prev>6873331</prev>\n<first>6873296</first>\n<last>6873477</last>\n<when>1178326689</when>\n<utime>05/05/07 03:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
