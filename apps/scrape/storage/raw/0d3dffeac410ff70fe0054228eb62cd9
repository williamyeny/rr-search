Just make a fresh batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're making your own syringes, there is no need to pressure cook them.  Simple boiling for 20 minutes is plenty. I boil the syringes with them 2/3 full of water, then just before I use the syringe, I remove from the pot of water and squirt the water out of the syringe. Remember, plastic doesn't harbor endospores, which is the only reason we use a pressure cooker with grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to Lysol inside the glovebox.  Simply wipe the inside with a damp cloth.  The air inside a glovebox isn't sterile.  The air inside a glovebox is still, which prevents contaminants entering your jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a syringe right after flaming.  It will take two or three seconds for you to move from the torch to the jar, and that's plenty of time.  Insert the needle and let the first drop or two of solution finish cooling your needle, because this way you know that the rest of the 2 ml that follows will be clean.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6335268</next>\n<prev>6333784</prev>\n<first>6333784</first>\n<last>6335838</last>\n<when>1165282071</when>\n<utime>12/05/06 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
