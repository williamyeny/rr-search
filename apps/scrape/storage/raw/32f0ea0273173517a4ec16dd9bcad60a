If you could maintain the 65C temperature at the center of the substrate for an hour, it would be pasteurized,  but if the dishwasher is only reaching 65C, it would take a few hours.  However, many growers have successfully colonized unpasteurized manure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest following standard pasteurizing teks for the casing layer, if used.  They're far less forgiving than substrates, which fully colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8051083</next>\n<prev>8050367</prev>\n<first>8048003</first>\n<last>8057501</last>\n<when>1203585283</when>\n<utime>02/21/08 11:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
