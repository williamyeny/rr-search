Coir has at least as much nutrition for fungi as cow manure, and comes close to rivaling horse manure.  It will contaminate, but not easily if you pasteurize it properly.  I doubt lc will inoculate coir or manure either one.  You'll need to use your lc to inoculate grains or brf, then spawn that to the coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5606710</next>\n<prev>5606528</prev>\n<first>5606488</first>\n<last>5606761</last>\n<when>1147145046</when>\n<utime>05/09/06 06:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
