The original straw log tek was written for open air fruiting, and laundry baskets of straw do fine in an open room.  It helps to cover them with a piece of plastic sheeting during colonization to hold the CO2 in a bit, and also cover them with sheeting during primordia formation to hold humidity, but be sure to uncover a few times per day for air exchange.  Once mushrooms form, you can leave it uncovered.  It helps to run a humidifier or two in the room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6003954</next>\n<prev>6003908</prev>\n<first>6003896</first>\n<last>6003954</last>\n<when>1156769723</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 03:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
