I will report back and let you know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to go well thus far. I actually feel the perlite was able to absorb water more efficiently this way. When I was pouring water on top of the perlite it was growing from absorbing so much water so fast, it was pretty trippy lol I was thinking, &quot;OH SHIT! It's gonna overflow!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a waste of time and takes far longer than running water under a faucet through a colander.&amp;nbsp; Perlite doesn't absorb water, nor does it grow or swell up when wet.&amp;nbsp; It's a crystalline substance.&amp;nbsp; Just get it wet and use it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19529129</next>\n<prev>19528630</prev>\n<first>19528358</first>\n<last>19530023</last>\n<when>1391683519</when>\n<utime>02/06/14 12:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
