Get it wet, drain well, then dump it in two to three inches deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never put the cakes on the perlite.  Set them on jar lids or something similar.  They'll become waterlogged sitting directly on perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the search feature to find all you want to know about terrariums, but with an aquarium, perlite on the bottom, and a piece of plexiglass on top, you have a terrarium.  Open it several times per day to fan out. Just use the lid and fan several times back and forth with it to exchange the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's considered bad form to bump your own post without giving 24 hours for response first.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6161496</next>\n<prev>6161432</prev>\n<first>6161309</first>\n<last>6161523</last>\n<when>1160667201</when>\n<utime>10/12/06 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
