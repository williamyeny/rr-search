When there is no more smell, it's ready to use. It should also be cut with coir or verm to fluff it up because it tends to pack too tight, making it hard to colonize.  Worm castings, used coffee grinds, compost, straw, chicken manure, etc., can all be added to make the substrate more complex, which benefits the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6075191</prev>\n<first>6067361</first>\n<last>6075307</last>\n<when>1158627537</when>\n<utime>09/19/06 03:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
