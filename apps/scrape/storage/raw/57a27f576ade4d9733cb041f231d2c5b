I always insert a piece of wood, such as a medical tongue depressor into each slant.  The mycelium colonizes the wood and lasts much longer under storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get test tubes with screw on lids.  Drill a 1/8&quot; hole in the lid.  Cut a synthetic filter disk to fit inside the test tube lid.  Screw the lid down tight, and PC in a rack with the test tubes standing upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When removed from the PC, lay the rack over with a jar lid or something under one side so the test tubes are at an angle as they cool.  Try to get the mycelium within 1/2&quot; or so of the opening, so you don't have to reach in as far when you want to get some myceium out.  You'll have to flame any part of your scalpel that penetrates into the slant, so it's easier if you don't have to reach in as far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use triple the usual amount of water in the PC when I make agar so that the PC cools down slower and releases pressure slower to prevent boil over.  One should NEVER lift the weight or release the valve to let pressure off a PC.  It ruins the product inside.  Agar boils over and grains (or your pot roast) dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also shouldn't use a jar for preparing agar.  Use a whiskey bottle or something similar with a long neck that is made for pouring.  It also will have a smaller opening that will be less prone to allowing contaminants to enter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6349709</prev>\n<first>6349348</first>\n<last>6349783</last>\n<when>1165648193</when>\n<utime>12/09/06 09:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
