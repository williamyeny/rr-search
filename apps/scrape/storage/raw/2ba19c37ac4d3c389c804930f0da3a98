The bacteria in peat is beneficial and helps to protect against molds.  The only time you need to be sterile is when preparing your spawn, whether brf or rye or whatever.  Once it's fully colonized, you don't want your bulk substrate to be sterile.  That's why we only pasteurize straw and casing materials.  We want to kill the mold spores, but allow the bacteria to survive.  To pasteurize a casing layer, simply bring it to field moisture level, then heat to 140-150F for an hour.  Whatever method you use is fine.  I discourage microwave use because it will get the material too hot, thus killing the beneficial bacteria.  Once they're gone, molds such as trich, aspergillus and penicillium can take hold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8461726</next>\n<prev>4505164</prev>\n<first>4504244</first>\n<last>8462586</last>\n<when>1123391128</when>\n<utime>08/07/05 08:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
