Brown rice flour and vermiculite or perlite were long used as a source of spawn in the pre-flow hood days. PFs claim to fame is the spore syringe. However, naming any 'tek' after oneself is considered very bad form, and it's the reason he was never accepted into the mushroom community at large, outside of the online community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for soaking cakes, a properly made cake is always made on the dry side, which results in faster colonization.
