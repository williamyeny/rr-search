Take some h202 straight out of the bottle and spray it on some fresh pins that don't have cobweb. Tell me how that works out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight peroxide isn't suitable for much more than providing oxygen for solid fuel rocket boosters.&amp;nbsp; In some countries it's sold in ten to thirty percent concentrations, but in the USA, it's packaged in brown bottles and sold in drug and grocery stores at the 3% concentration that is exactly what we want for spraying cobweb mold.&amp;nbsp; The 3% solution should not be diluted further, but rather should be used right from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide does harm mycelium.&amp;nbsp; If you spray pins with 3% peroxide and allow them to remain saturated, they will abort. If you're spraying for cobweb, be sure to avoid pins, and if you do hit the pins, fan dry them right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A treatment with 3% peroxide on a cobweb infestation should be repeated twice after the initial application at 12 hour intervals to prevent the cobweb from coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increase fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; Cobweb rarely forms when there is sufficient fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11285234</next>\n<prev>11283312</prev>\n<first>11281013</first>\n<last>11322323</last>\n<when>1256059340</when>\n<utime>10/20/09 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
