You want bright light for 12 hours per day, not normal room light, which is usually at the red end of the spectrum if it's from incandescent bulbs, and is the worst possible choice.  Incandescent bulbs produce light at 3000K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool white fluorescents are a higher frequency light and perform much better, with a color temperature of 5000K, and &lt;i&gt;natural daylight fluorescent&lt;/i&gt; produces light at the 'blue' end of the spectrum with a color temperature of 6500K.  You don't want blue lights.  Light at the high(blue) end of the spectrum will look white to your eyes.  You don't get high frequency light by using a bulb with a blue dye on the lense.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6738384</next>\n<prev>6736817</prev>\n<first>6736656</first>\n<last>6744244</last>\n<when>1175493785</when>\n<utime>04/02/07 09:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
