You might even move the cakes to where they can get some diffused sunlight each day.  Even direct sunlight for a few minutes is a good thing.  You might try some damp verm on top of the cake too.  That seems to help with pinsets.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2788614</next>\n<prev>2788595</prev>\n<first>2786929</first>\n<last>2789099</last>\n<when>1087093957</when>\n<utime>06/13/04 05:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
