It's not going to clog up the needle, and will push right out if some gets in.&amp;nbsp; Just work accurately and have your hand braced so you won't shoot all your spores at once.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16387037</next>\n<prev>16380754</prev>\n<first>16360233</first>\n<last>16387037</last>\n<when>1339700493</when>\n<utime>06/14/12 10:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
