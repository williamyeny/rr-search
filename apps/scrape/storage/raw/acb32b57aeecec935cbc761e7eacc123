If it's a cube, it will grow cubes.  If you mix spores from more than one print, you'll still grow cubes.  Compare it to a human from Canada having a baby with a human from Mexico.  The child will still be human.  As long as they're the same species, the genes usually mix freely.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7546840</prev>\n<first>7546840</first>\n<last>7546955</last>\n<when>1193082153</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
