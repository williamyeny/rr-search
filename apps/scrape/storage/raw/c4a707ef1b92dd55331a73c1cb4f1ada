I ended up getting hundreds of cubes from it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Back then, there were no vendors, no commercially available spores, no teks, and no cultivation books available in the library, book stores or headshops. There damn sure wasn't any videos. VHS and Beta players weren't even on the market yet, and DVDs would need another 20 or so years to be invented. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've come a long way since then.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13087488</next>\n<prev>13087196</prev>\n<first>13086574</first>\n<last>13093992</last>\n<when>1282519350</when>\n<utime>08/23/10 02:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
