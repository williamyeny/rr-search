Then just dump it in a few sandwich-sized tupperwares(or one larger but keep it pretty shallow) make sure it has an even a surface as possible and then case it w/ dry verm about 3/8&quot; thick. Cover for about a week and let the myc consolidate and then remove the cover and fruit. Simple is almost always better, be diligent about sterilization and you should be alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way.&amp;nbsp; You should only shake once at about 20% colonization, and then you don't shake again until you're ready to get the grains out of the jar.&amp;nbsp; Shaking every few days ruins the mycelium, and gives bacteria and other contaminants an excellent opportunity to take over the substrate.&amp;nbsp; You also don't case with dry verm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If those are the only two ingredients you have, I'd suggest mixing the moist verm and popcorn together, as if the verm were a bulk substrate.&amp;nbsp; Allow it to all knit together and then expose to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; Popcorn is the worst grain, so consider yourself lucky if you get to a decent flush.&amp;nbsp; I've seen a few, but they're the exceptions, rather than the rule.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11118023</next>\n<prev>11117791</prev>\n<first>11116059</first>\n<last>11120322</last>\n<when>1253802976</when>\n<utime>09/24/09 05:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
