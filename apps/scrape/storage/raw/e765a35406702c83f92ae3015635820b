Did everything else the same, from wiping down the lips of the jars, &lt;b&gt;1 hour boil in pot,&lt;/b&gt; 12-16 hour cool down. Probably just rushed through and am reaping the benefits (/sarcasm) now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make as large a batch as you want.&amp;nbsp; However, a one hour boil isn't going to sterilize the mix, especially when you used the wrong size jars.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to STEAM them for 90 minutes &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the steam begins escaping from under the tight fitting lid.&amp;nbsp; This means your water needs to be 'boiling' for around two hours to accomplish the above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17040279</next>\n<prev>17039436</prev>\n<first>17037882</first>\n<last>17042912</last>\n<when>1350385366</when>\n<utime>10/16/12 02:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
