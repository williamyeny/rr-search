In addition, the danger with asbestos is from inhaling dust from the fibers over a long time, such as working in a mine 8 hours a day for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't from eating mushrooms from a cake with vermiculite in it, even if it DID have asbestos, which it doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7183949</next>\n<prev>7183719</prev>\n<first>7183114</first>\n<last>7183949</last>\n<when>1184623881</when>\n<utime>07/17/07 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
