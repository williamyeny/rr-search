In the future, it's best to dispose of contaminated jars without opening.  The chances of releasing contaminant spores in mass is not worth the dollar or less that a new jar would cost.   If you MUST save your jars, PC for an hour before opening to kill the mold.  This is mostly to protect your future grows, not your own health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your cough is probably due to what's going around in the human community.  I have one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll move this to contamination forum for you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6629497</next>\n<prev>6629458</prev>\n<first>6629458</first>\n<last>6629525</last>\n<when>1172891662</when>\n<utime>03/03/07 05:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
