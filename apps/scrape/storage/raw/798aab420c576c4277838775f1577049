(Roughly 16 Quarts or more)&lt;br /&gt;I can refrigerate extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For small amounts like that, I'd suggest sticking with quart jars.&amp;nbsp; You want to prove your spawn before putting into a large bag anyway.&amp;nbsp; I use the large gusseted spawn bags, and each one holds six quarts of rye berries, when filled 1/3 full.&amp;nbsp; This is about right because you want a plenum of air space above your grains at least as large as the volume of grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always inoculate quart jars as my 'grain masters' and once I know they're contaminant free, I use each of them to inoculate 2 of the spawn bags, filled with six quarts of rye.&amp;nbsp; This ensures I don't lose a large amount if the culture is contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't waste money on an impulse sealer.&amp;nbsp; Get bailing tie wire from your local hardware store and use this to tie the bags shut at the top like a loaf of bread.&amp;nbsp; This enables you to open the bag later without cutting it.&amp;nbsp; I get two uses from each spawn bag, thus cutting the price in half.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10038000</next>\n<prev>10037925</prev>\n<first>10030215</first>\n<last>10050684</last>\n<when>1237999554</when>\n<utime>03/25/09 07:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
