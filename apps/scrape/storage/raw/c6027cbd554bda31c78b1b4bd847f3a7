Leaching isn't the answer, aging is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horse manure doesn't work nearly as well composted as uncomposted.  Dry, field aged nuggets work best, and there's no urine to leach out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ammonia needs to be evaporated off.  Only time will do that.  Those in cold climates need to stock up on aged, sun dried manure during the summer and keep it in dry storage for use during winter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6321749</next>\n<prev>6321699</prev>\n<first>6320249</first>\n<last>6321749</last>\n<when>1164923644</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 11:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
