It needs the organisms in the soil to prevent contamination.  I'd also suspect your cake was contaminated prior to spawning to the manure if it was green within a week.  I've stored bagged cow manure outdoors for months without it growing trich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spread the bagged cow manure out on a tarp in the hot sun, the ammonia is gone within hours.  If it's cool weather, it might take a few days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7077239</prev>\n<first>7069193</first>\n<last>7077267</last>\n<when>1182480122</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 05:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
