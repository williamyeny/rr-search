The link to shroomtalk had a picture of bacteria growing up out of a contaminated LC.&amp;nbsp; That wasn't a lion's mane fruit, but the new grower mistook it for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's shitcan the hostility folks.&amp;nbsp; New growers are trying to learn and they're going to make mistakes.&amp;nbsp; I can remember when everyone of you shit-talkers were noobs yourselves.&amp;nbsp; Be nice please or don't post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thread is one more reason I don't recommend LC, and it's not just because it's not noob friendly.&amp;nbsp; It's because there's far better ways to grow mushrooms, and LC is perhaps the slowest method of all to expand mycelium.&amp;nbsp; It's simply a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9803413</next>\n<prev>9803278</prev>\n<first>9796196</first>\n<last>11525880</last>\n<when>1234739344</when>\n<utime>02/16/09 01:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
