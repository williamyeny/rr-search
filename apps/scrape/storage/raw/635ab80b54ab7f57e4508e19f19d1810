My first grow got contaminated during the first flush and I was scared shitless to eat the fruits cause of all the people spreading fear about contam. I ate some and was just fine infact better than fine it was awsome. When this happens to me I use an eye dropper full of peroxide and put a few drops on the infection a day so long as the contam is small and it should keep everything running till its done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad advice.&amp;nbsp; It's not due to any danger to us that we put contaminated substrates outdoors, because trich isn't dangerous to healthy humans.&amp;nbsp; We move contaminated products outdoors to finish so the trillions of spores don't infect our grow areas.&amp;nbsp; The fruits are fine to eat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14627795</next>\n<prev>14627676</prev>\n<first>14627093</first>\n<last>14627836</last>\n<when>1308332440</when>\n<utime>06/17/11 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
