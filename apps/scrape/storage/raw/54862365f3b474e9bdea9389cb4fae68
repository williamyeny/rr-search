Green molds are not toxic to human digestive systems, and besides, the mold isn't conducted into the fruits anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy mushrooms are fine, whether or not the substrate has mold on it.&amp;nbsp; However, if it's your first time growing, you better make sure that's the species you were growing and not a contaminant species of mushroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always toss out contaminated substrates as soon as they're discovered.&amp;nbsp; You can bury them outdoors and they might fruit, but you always want to get them out of your growing area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;slightly contaminated cake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's like being slightly pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12639233</prev>\n<first>12638972</first>\n<last>12639846</last>\n<when>1275000004</when>\n<utime>05/28/10 01:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
