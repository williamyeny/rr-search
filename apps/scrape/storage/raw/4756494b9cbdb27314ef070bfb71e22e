Coir has lots of nutes and tends toward overlay if used as a casing.  However, overlay isn't to be worried too much about, as cubes will fruit just fine from an overlayed casing.  Just dunk between flushes.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>3911141</prev>\n<first>3911101</first>\n<last>3911258</last>\n<when>1110740963</when>\n<utime>03/13/05 09:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
