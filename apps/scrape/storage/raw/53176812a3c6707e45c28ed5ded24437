Extend the salt layer about 1&quot; beyond any green you see. It's not for when&amp;nbsp; your whole tray is contaminated, but if there's a small spot and your fruits are approaching harvest, it will&amp;nbsp; buy you the time they need to finish.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8820640</prev>\n<first>8820224</first>\n<last>8820667</last>\n<when>1219613362</when>\n<utime>08/25/08 12:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
