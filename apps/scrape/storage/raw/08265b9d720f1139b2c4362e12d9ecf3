It's sold under a lot of different brand names, but most common is 'Damp-Rid'.  It's used to dry out wet closets, under counters, below sinks, car and boat carpeting, and mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat from a food dehydrator is of minimal effect on the psilocybin, and psilocin rarely survives drying anyway.
