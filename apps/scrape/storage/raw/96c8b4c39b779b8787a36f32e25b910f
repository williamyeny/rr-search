Unfortunately, my love is fungi and growing mushrooms, developing new TEKs, and constantly experimenting to find better methods of cultivation. Being a moderator means one has to walk a fine line between censorship and police action, neither of which I'm any good at. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/images/lock.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;This thread has been closed.&lt;/b&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>13636432</prev>\n<first>13633507</first>\n<last>13636554</last>\n<when>1292437457</when>\n<utime>12/15/10 08:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
