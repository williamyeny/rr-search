I wouldn't be without mine.  Bear in mind, you don't want to toss out your glovebox though, because when you isolate away from contaminants you will still use a glovebox.  Rule number one is never open a contaminated petri dish or jar, bag, etc, in front of the flowhood or the air will blow the contaminant spores everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6925901</next>\n<prev>6925410</prev>\n<first>6925410</first>\n<last>6926401</last>\n<when>1179348899</when>\n<utime>05/16/07 11:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
