One problem with mixing is you can easily damage the grain, which opens the uncolonized center of the kernels up to contamination.  If you mix, do it gently.  Otherwise, just do 1/2&quot; layer of manure, followed by a layer of colonized grain, then repeat until the tray is filled.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6482224</next>\n<prev>6481079</prev>\n<first>6481066</first>\n<last>6482224</last>\n<when>1169405590</when>\n<utime>01/21/07 08:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
