Theoretically this means that as they grow mushrooms just put on water weight and and stretch themselves out as opposed to developing more of the active compound..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&amp;nbsp; They're continuing to divide cells, while also engorging with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller mushrooms are more potent by weight than they'd be if you allowed them to go full size.&amp;nbsp; I like to pick large pins just before the cap starts opening.&amp;nbsp; This also gets them before they become gut-wrenching nasty to choke down. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:tongue:&quot; title=&quot;:tongue:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19547552</next>\n<prev>19547497</prev>\n<first>19546759</first>\n<last>19560701</last>\n<when>1392058285</when>\n<utime>02/10/14 08:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
