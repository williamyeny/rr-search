{"key":"post-5807065","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5807065</id>\n<content>Just remember, lysol is explosive, and you really need to flame sterilize needles and scalpels.  I recommend soap and water to clean a glovebox.  It need not be sterile, and there is no advantage to having it sterile.  A glovebox only needs to have still air so you can open jars or petri dishes and not get contaminants blown into them by the air currents in a normal room.  Even bleach is overkill, but not dangerous the way alcohol based products such as lysol are.  Don't waste your money on anything with a fan or filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5807394</next>\n<prev>5806996</prev>\n<first>4889058</first>\n<last>5809565</last>\n<when>1151701781</when>\n<utime>07/01/06 12:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
