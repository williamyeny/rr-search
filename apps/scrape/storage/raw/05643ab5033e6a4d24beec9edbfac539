You need to spread the manure out on a tarp in the sun for a day or two until the ammonia evaporates off.  At that time, hydrate and pasteurizize.  I wouldn't suggest your previous method unless you only put a quart or so of manure into each bag.  Jars work well with that method.  With smaller containers, they heat up sooner than a large oven type bag.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7211169</next>\n<prev>7211146</prev>\n<first>7208463</first>\n<last>7213337</last>\n<when>1185152765</when>\n<utime>07/23/07 04:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
