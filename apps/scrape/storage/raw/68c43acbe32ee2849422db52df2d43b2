The question is why when I do my straw at 180 it turns out fine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If straw gets fully colonized within a few days, it's not likely to contaminate until after first flush anyway, regardless of pasteurization technique.&amp;nbsp; If you're planning low spawn ratios such as we do in commercial production of 1 to 20 or less, you want to be spot-on with your pasteurization.&amp;nbsp; When experimenting at home and using somewhat higher spawn rates, you sometimes outrun the contamination.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea with keeping temps low is to kill off the mold, but leave some of the heat resistant bacteria alive.&amp;nbsp; Some of these bacteria feed on mold while not damaging the mushroom mycelium, so they're beneficial to have.&amp;nbsp; Others serve as pinning triggers in ways we're still trying to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>24821500</next>\n<prev>24821166</prev>\n<first>24820802</first>\n<last>24834696</last>\n<when>1512249162</when>\n<utime>12/02/17 11:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
