Grey or black heads indicate aborts.  Pins that have simply stopped growing but have normal color are NOT aborts and should not be picked.  It's common for many species including cubensis to set all the primordia for the first few flushes when primordia for first flush is set.  They stop growing until their time comes, at which time they kick into gear again.  If you pick them, you ruin future flushes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6570541</next>\n<prev>6570398</prev>\n<first>6567633</first>\n<last>6571341</last>\n<when>1171565131</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 08:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
