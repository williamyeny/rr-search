{"key":"post-5364250","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5364250</id>\n<content>The 50% figure I give is for 'normal' strength coffee, so if you drink it starbucks strong, I'd cut it in half again, but that still isn't what prevented germination, even if you had used pure, very strong coffee.  Did you remember a bit of lime to balance the ph?  Personally, I think even without ph balance and coffee too strong, you'd have gotten growth, just not optimal.  I'd check your spores and or grain tek.  Open the jars and see if they stink.  Also, make sure you didn't get feed rye, as that could have fungicides on it which would definitely stop germination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5363899</prev>\n<first>5356681</first>\n<last>5364250</last>\n<when>1141495680</when>\n<utime>03/04/06 08:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
