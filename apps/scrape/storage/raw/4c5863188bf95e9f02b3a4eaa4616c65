{"key":"post-5681271","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5681271</id>\n<content>I take it you were wanting to directly spray down outdoor beds with the myceliated water?  I'm wondering what would support the mycelium until it gets established into the wood?  Perhaps you could have a bit of sterilized sawdust in the LC mix, that the mycelium would be attached to so it wouldn't pour off with the rest of the LC.  That might sustain it until it began to colonize the wood. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5681333</next>\n<prev>5681260</prev>\n<first>5681243</first>\n<last>5721325</last>\n<when>1148777699</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
