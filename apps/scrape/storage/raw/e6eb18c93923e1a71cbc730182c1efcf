I like the new PMP. Seems to be getting great FAE. Also, When I came home I had to wipe off the humidity/temp gauges as they were soaked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means the cakes are getting saturated too.&amp;nbsp; If the cakes get too wet, the fruits will look short and fat and often abort.&amp;nbsp; You need to let the cakes partly dry out, and then replace that water with manual misting.&amp;nbsp; Don't let your air pump mist settle on the cakes or they'll get waterlogged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11475900</next>\n<prev>11475655</prev>\n<first>11472728</first>\n<last>11487381</last>\n<when>1258507611</when>\n<utime>11/18/09 03:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
