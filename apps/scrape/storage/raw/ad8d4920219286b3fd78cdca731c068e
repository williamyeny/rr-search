{"key":"post-6413050","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6413050</id>\n<content>It's easier to just toss a brick of coir into water, then after it's fully absorbed all it's going to, simply squeeze out of any excess as you transfer it to another container for mixing.  You don't need to use distilled water.  I've never used anything but plain tap water for substrate and grain preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck on the experiment primate.  We know worm castings are good, and we know coir is good, so it should work out well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6413075</next>\n<prev>6412861</prev>\n<first>6412227</first>\n<last>6585230</last>\n<when>1167584979</when>\n<utime>12/31/06 07:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
