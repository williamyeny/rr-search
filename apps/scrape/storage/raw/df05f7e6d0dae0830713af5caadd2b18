{"key":"post-6991957","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6991957</id>\n<content>Why would you need peroxide on sterile grains?  If they're sterile, they're &lt;i&gt;sterile&lt;/i&gt;.  Peroxide breaks down rapidly on organic matter, so if your LC is contaminated it won't help anyway, and peroxide is toxic to fungi.  Diluted enough, it won't kill mushroom mycelium outright, but it doesn't do it any good either.   Just use good sterile procedure and save the peroxide for controlling cobweb mold on casing layers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6992028</next>\n<prev>6991879</prev>\n<first>6991611</first>\n<last>6993922</last>\n<when>1180646580</when>\n<utime>06/01/07 12:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
