You want to use a thermometer stuck into the center of the casing mixture, and that thermometer needs to read 140F to 170F for an hour to an hour and a half.  That would probably take three hours or more in the oven, thus drying out the mixture.  I'd recommend using quart jars and pasteurizing in a large kettle or PC.  Just use a thermometer stuck into one of the jars and be sure to maintain pasteurization temps for that amount of time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't bother measuring your water.  Add water until your casing mixture is at field capacity, then pasteurize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6414824</next>\n<prev>6414753</prev>\n<first>6414753</first>\n<last>6415100</last>\n<when>1167635412</when>\n<utime>01/01/07 09:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
