It was hard to get myself to even take the lid off for a picture.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, contaminants in a fruiting chamber are caused by NOT removing the lid enough.  In fact, I often fruit terrarium/tub grows with the lid completely off for the whole two to three weeks they're in there.  Fresh air prevents contaminants from getting a start.  Still air encourages them.  The humidity will still be high down inside the tub, even if you throw the lid away.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6589349</next>\n<prev>6589238</prev>\n<first>6589183</first>\n<last>8061795</last>\n<when>1171999245</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 09:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
