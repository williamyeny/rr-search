When germinating spores on agar, I never allow the initial growth to get larger than 1/2&quot; (1cm) before beginning transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut through the mycelium and the agar and transfer both to the new dish, but remember, only a very small piece.  If you transfer a large wedge, there is a greater chance you'll also transfer some of the contaminant along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the reason we use agar.  It's for isolation from contaminants, which can't be done in the three dimensional space of an LC or grain/brf jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap your dishes with parafilm.  Leaving a petri dish unwrapped is like using a grain jar without a filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6110428</next>\n<prev>6110322</prev>\n<first>6109099</first>\n<last>6110428</last>\n<when>1159451743</when>\n<utime>09/28/06 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
