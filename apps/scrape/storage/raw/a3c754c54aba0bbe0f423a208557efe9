The site you and RR linked to doesn't seem to say which one to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The viscosity of a fluid such as water changes slightly with temperature.&amp;nbsp; Use the 60F figure since it's closer to the normal room temperature you'll be working with.&amp;nbsp; Static pressure is measured in inches of water column or the metric equivalent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine taking a piece of tubing and bending it into a U shape an filling the bottom of the U with water.&amp;nbsp; The water would equalize in the bottom and extend the same distance up each side of the U.&amp;nbsp; If you connected a hose from the plenum of your flowhood to one side of the tube and it pushed the water down 1&quot; while raising it 1&quot; on the other end of the tube, that would be 1&quot; WC static pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the attached document and there's a description of manometer operation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10888826</next>\n<prev>10888429</prev>\n<first>10874875</first>\n<last>17917030</last>\n<when>1250693986</when>\n<utime>08/19/09 05:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
