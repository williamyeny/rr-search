It's widly misunderstood that CO2 is heavier than air, and many growers think it will run out like water if only there's holes in the bottom.  The fact is, the CO2 mixes with the air inside the tub and raises its CO2 content.  You have to exchange ALL the air in the tub to get rid of it.  I simply drill lots of holes in the fruiting chamber, and let nature take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7451478</next>\n<prev>7450540</prev>\n<first>7448682</first>\n<last>7451478</last>\n<when>1190724324</when>\n<utime>09/25/07 03:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
