Popcorn is obscenely high in bacterial endospores.  It should be considered a spawn of last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest rye berries, but WBS is ok too. You should rinse all grains FIRST, prior to the soak.  By rinsing the dry grains, all that crap will float to the top and run off.  Just put the dry grains into the pot you're going to soak in, then fill with water and stir at the same time.  You'll see all the chafe and grain dust, dirt, etc float into the water so you can pour it off.  I usually give grains three to four rinses like said above before filling the pot with hot tap water to begin the soak period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really isn't necessary to germinate all the endospores first to kill them in the PC.  Just soak for a few hours to soften the kernels, then boil until they're fully hydrated. The short soak will also hydrate the endospores, making them susceptible to the heat from the PC. The soak before the boil will also soften the the grains so they don't burst as you boil to finish hydrating.  All grains should be considered fully hydrated when twice their original dry size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cause of stalling is no gas exchange during colonization.  You must have holes in your jar lids, with some sort of filter material to allow gas exchange but prevent contaminant spores from entering.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6154020</next>\n<prev>6154004</prev>\n<first>6153968</first>\n<last>6155000</last>\n<when>1160504783</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 09:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
