The mycelium colonizes the &lt;i&gt;available&lt;/i&gt; substrate and then fruits.  Sometimes, the limits of available substrate are determined by the cold temperatures in the fall, thus fruiting is initiated with species such as shiitake and P nameko, etc.  I've seen Hericium fruiting in the wild from the same tree for decades.  Obviously, it didn't capture the whole tree the first, or even succeeding years.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many species of mycelium are secondary decomposers, thus they can't even begin to colonize a part of the tree until some other species has finished munching that area.  Thus, when the mycelium reaches that inaccessible part, full colonization is reached.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7831646</next>\n<prev>7831617</prev>\n<first>7812755</first>\n<last>9827473</last>\n<when>1199470901</when>\n<utime>01/04/08 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
