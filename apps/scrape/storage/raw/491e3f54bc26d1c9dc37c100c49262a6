The reason is they won't fruit sooner than that anyway, so leave them in the jars where they're not drying out while the mycelium consolidates its hold on the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the pink spot is mold, it's probably Geotrichum or similar.  Toss it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine verm is ok to use.  In fact, it will make a better filter on top than course verm.  It does great in the brf as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6593991</next>\n<prev>6593696</prev>\n<first>6593570</first>\n<last>6593991</last>\n<when>1172089182</when>\n<utime>02/21/07 10:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
