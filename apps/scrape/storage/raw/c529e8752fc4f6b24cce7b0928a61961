{"key":"post-9834599","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>9834599</id>\n<content>I replaced the nozzle and weight assembly with a 1/8&quot; NPT(national pipe thread) stopcock, available at any NAPA auto parts store. They're intended for use as radiator drain valves. I open it up to allow the PC to vent and then slowly close it after ten minutes or so of venting.&amp;nbsp; The valve itself only cost $1.50, so it's a lot cheaper than the rocker valve AA sells.&amp;nbsp; I like it better because I can leave it slightly cracked if I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don't recommend the above modification to anyone who tends to drink or smoke out while the PC is running.&amp;nbsp; You're defeating half your safety factor by doing so.&amp;nbsp; With that valve closed, the only thing to keep the PC from blowing is that black rubber plug, and if it blows out, you're screwed because it usually destroys it, and you're down until you order and receive another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't use less time when I go 20 PSI because I live at altitude in the mountains, so the extra few PSI in actuality only give me roughly the same temp as I had when I lived in Seattle at sea level.&amp;nbsp; I PC quart/liter grain jars for 90 minutes, and 5 lb filter patch bags for 120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9834647</next>\n<prev>9834520</prev>\n<first>9833824</first>\n<last>9840306</last>\n<when>1235173842</when>\n<utime>02/21/09 01:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
