That's caused by lack of air exchange/high CO2 levels, which means you need to fan more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the perlite is damp, but not wet, and has no standing water. The perlite should be fluffed up.  If it's compacted, it can't work well.   Get rid of the weatherstripping to help with air exchange. The fruits with black heads are aborts and should be removed when you pick the rest of the fruits.  Watch those black spots.  I can't see from the picture, but it could be pin mold.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main sign of low humidity is cracked caps, which you don't have, so it indicates your humidity level is fine.  You just need more air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382946</next>\n<prev>6382292</prev>\n<first>6382285</first>\n<last>6382946</last>\n<when>1166458596</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 06:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
