Hydrated lime, because it's powdered and water soluable is a short term buffer.  What you want is a short term because the life of a casing is measured in weeks instead of months or years.  Use hydrated lime to get the ph right at the start, and use gypsum at a rate of ten percent to the peat in your casing to prevent ph swings later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without ph strips, try using equal amounts of peat and verm.  Add gypsum at the rate of one cup to each ten cups of peat.  Add one teaspoon of hydrated lime to each cup of peat.  Mix all the dry ingredients except the verm together, then moisten.   Add moisture to the verm, then combine the two.  Let sit for half an hour, then begin adjusting for field capacity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5846163</next>\n<prev>5844222</prev>\n<first>5843980</first>\n<last>5846163</last>\n<when>1152587476</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 06:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
