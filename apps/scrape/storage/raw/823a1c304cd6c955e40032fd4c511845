{"key":"post-5841586","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5841586</id>\n<content>Light is only one of the pinning triggers.  I hate that it is so horribly overrated and misunderstood even after all these years.  &lt;i&gt;There is no reason or need to keep colonizing jars in the dark, period&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light only becomes one of the pinning triggers when full colonization is reached and a decrease in CO2 levels is realized.  The time to give your mycelium darkness is for a few days before you birth pf jars, or if you spawn to bulk, keep colonizing bulk substrates and casing layers in the dark by covering with foil until you are ready to induce fruiting by increasing air exchange.  When you remove the foil from a fully colonized cased substrate, you simultaneously increase air exchange and provide light, therefore all your pinning triggers are working together at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, primary pinning triggers are full colonization and an increase in air exchange with a corresponding decrease in CO2 levels.  Once these conditions have been met, light becomes a secondary pinning trigger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During initial colonization of brf or grain jars, the primary pinning conditions have not been met, so light is not a factor.  You can look at your colonizing jars all you want in normal indoor room lighting. I've never seen a jar pin early prior to full colonization unless something else was wrong, such as too little or too much moisture, or a contaminant.  Such will kick in the natural survival response to reproduce.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5841509</prev>\n<first>5840982</first>\n<last>5841586</last>\n<when>1152537806</when>\n<utime>07/10/06 04:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
