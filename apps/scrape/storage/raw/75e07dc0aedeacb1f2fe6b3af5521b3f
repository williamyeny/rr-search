However, my experience is that when a tray contaminates with mold prior to first flush, it's because the spawn itself was contaminated, not the casing layer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That fact that your jars took ten weeks to colonize instead of two to three weeks, bears this out.  You need to find a cleaner source for spores or follow sterile technique earlier in the process.  That's where things went south, not at the casing stage.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6709440</next>\n<prev>6706512</prev>\n<first>6706512</first>\n<last>6714413</last>\n<when>1174779555</when>\n<utime>03/25/07 02:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
