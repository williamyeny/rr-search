I get it for $117/ton dumped right into my truck from a hopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply ask any local farmer where he gets bulk gypsum to spread on his fields.&amp;nbsp; He'll give you the industrial scale supplier where you need to be buying from.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15626973</next>\n<prev>15619191</prev>\n<first>15616235</first>\n<last>15626973</last>\n<when>1325784698</when>\n<utime>01/05/12 07:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
