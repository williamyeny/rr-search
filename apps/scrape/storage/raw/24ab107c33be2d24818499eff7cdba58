Drying food does not guarantee that you won't get food poisoned from eating it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very true.  I read recently about hundreds of people who got sick from aflatoxins from tortillas made with contaminated corn.  Not too long ago, there was a major dog food problem with aflatoxins as well. Fortunately, our mushrooms make no such toxins.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5678455</next>\n<prev>5674472</prev>\n<first>5667490</first>\n<last>5680202</last>\n<when>1148699234</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
