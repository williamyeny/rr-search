Just incubate in the open at 75F to 80F, and your mycelium will be much healthier.  If your room is too cold, simply run a space heater to get it to the above temp range, but don't go over 80F, as it won't do a darn bit of good anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6584555</next>\n<prev>6584523</prev>\n<first>6584511</first>\n<last>6584555</last>\n<when>1171898368</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 05:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
