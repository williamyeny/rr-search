One less step to the syringe means more control of contamination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there any obvious flaws to this technique?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Printing directly into water has been around for many years.&amp;nbsp; Where you screwed up was dipping the syringe needle in alcohol.&amp;nbsp; You can print into a jar of sterilized water just fine.&amp;nbsp; It's even better if the jar of water is sitting on a magnetic stir plate.&amp;nbsp; Next time, sterilize the syringe, and then flame the needle just before sucking up the solution.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15126653</next>\n<prev>15126189</prev>\n<first>15125532</first>\n<last>15130629</last>\n<when>1316873792</when>\n<utime>09/24/11 05:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
