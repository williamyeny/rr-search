(fpm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An 18 X 18 filter has 3 square feet of area.&amp;nbsp; To get 100 fpm, you need a blower that will deliver 300 cfm(cubic feet per minute) at .58&quot; W.G.&amp;nbsp; Go to grainger.com and find a blower that will give you about half again that amount.&amp;nbsp; I'd look for a blower to deliver around 400 to 500 cfm at .6 to .8 w.g. to make up for friction losses and the drag of the prefilter.&amp;nbsp; You want your finished flowhood to produce about 100 to 125 fpm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term is 'blower', not pump.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16061766</next>\n<prev>16059665</prev>\n<first>16059333</first>\n<last>16072330</last>\n<when>1333893162</when>\n<utime>04/08/12 04:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
