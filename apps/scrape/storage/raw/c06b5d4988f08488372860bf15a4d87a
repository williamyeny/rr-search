What good would that do?  Spores by their very nature are not sterile. If you sterilze them, no mushrooms for you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homestead developed the process he's describing to use in their kits.  The bag of rye is sealed with a twist tie just above the grains and PC'd.  After it cools, a spore swab is dropped into the bag on TOP of the twist tie, then the bag is impulse sealed on the other side of the spore swab.  When ready to use, simply remove the twist tie and the spores drop into the sterile grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also nothing wrong with cotton.  It's not a bad &lt;br /&gt;substrate/casing material actually.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-13/208962316-Bunny_006qa.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-13/208962316-thumb_Bunny_006qa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5718118</next>\n<prev>5717531</prev>\n<first>5717292</first>\n<last>5718368</last>\n<when>1149599602</when>\n<utime>06/06/06 04:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
