{"key":"post-7864685","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7864685</id>\n<content>I've been saying that for years.  My petri dish studies a few years ago showed that cubensis reaches peak linear growth between 75F and 80F, then is flat until 83F, where it starts to slow down.  Mycelium at 86F is growing at about 2/3 the speed of mycelium at 80F.  In addition, the higher temps tend to stimulate thermophic molds and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's LOT'S of good information in TMC, but that 86F figure is one of the errors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7864688</next>\n<prev>7864353</prev>\n<first>7864335</first>\n<last>15963874</last>\n<when>1200077641</when>\n<utime>01/11/08 08:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
