They'll provide the humidity on their own.  If condensation is forming on the lid, it might be dripping back down on the casing layer, screwing things up.  Pins can usually take misting if allowed to dry afterwards, but water droplets falling on them hit like a machine gun.  What's your casing material and ph control?  That is my first guess of what's wrong.  Your fruits are down low on the sides of the substrate completely avoiding your casing layer, even on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5597510</next>\n<prev>5597495</prev>\n<first>5597410</first>\n<last>5601369</last>\n<when>1146935633</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 08:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
