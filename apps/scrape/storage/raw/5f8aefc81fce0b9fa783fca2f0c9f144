{"key":"post-5689803","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5689803</id>\n<content>There's always going to be some bacteria if you grow on manure or compost.  We pasteurize bulk substrates to actually save the bacteria, while killing off the molds.  The beneficial bacteria in compost or a casing layer actually helps.  If the fruits are healthy, there won't be much on them, except at the base where they're in contact with the manure, so cut off the bases or wash them well before eating if you're eating them fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when first starting spawn, if bacteria begins to grow on our grains, it will ruin the project.  Mycelium can't colonize a brf or grain substrate with bacillus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way bacteria can hurt is if the fruit bodies got damaged or otherwise stayed too wet and they have rotten places on them.  That bacteria will cause food poisoning if you eat the rotten parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toxins or contaminants are not generally transferred from the substrate to the fruitbodies except for heavy metals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria are killed or rendered dormant by drying.  It's only live bacteria that will make you sick, so drying the fruits will make them ok to eat.  Still, don't take that to mean it's ok to dry a rotten, slimy mushroom, and then eat it.  However, if everything went well and the fruits are normal, drying will render them safe from any bacteria that might be on them.  Boiling into tea will do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5690638</next>\n<prev>5687149</prev>\n<first>5686578</first>\n<last>5690638</last>\n<when>1148992480</when>\n<utime>05/30/06 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
