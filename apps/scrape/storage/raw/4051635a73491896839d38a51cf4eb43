Use the needle as soon as it isn't red hot anymore, which is only a second or two after you pull it away from the flame.  This way you know there are no contaminants on the needle.  The first drop or two of solution will sizzle and cool the needle, allowing the rest of the 1/2cc to flow cleanly.  I believe a couple drops of solution and the spores within are a worthy sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good idea to flame between jars to avoid cross-contamination, but there's no need to flame between holes on the same jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6261896</next>\n<prev>6260500</prev>\n<first>6250833</first>\n<last>6261896</last>\n<when>1163017732</when>\n<utime>11/08/06 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
