Make sure the holes in the lid and the foil stay open for gas exchange.  It's best to put the foil on over the lid, and then remove it right after sterilizing to help keep the vermiculite on top nice and dry.  If the verm barrier gets damp, it's likely to lead to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6881790</next>\n<prev>6881631</prev>\n<first>6881576</first>\n<last>6882691</last>\n<when>1178500533</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 04:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
