I was assuming you were using a tote type terrarium.  If you're trying to humidiy a mini-greenhouse with perlite, you're going to have a hard time.  It will help, but not enough.   Get a rubbermaid tote and build a simple terrarium.  what you have has too much cubic footage for the perlite to keep up with.  With perlite, you want the cakes sittig on a jar lid placed on the perlite.  Humidity is highest within 6&quot; of the surface of the damp perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7560751</next>\n<prev>7560675</prev>\n<first>7560411</first>\n<last>7561044</last>\n<when>1193366592</when>\n<utime>10/26/07 05:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
