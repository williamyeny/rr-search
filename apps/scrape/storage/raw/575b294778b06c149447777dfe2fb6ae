If not, flaming inside the glovebox will still fog up the inside, making it hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody please explain to me how alcohol wiping cleans the &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; of the needle where the inoculant is in direct contact as it passes.&amp;nbsp; Flaming the needle until red hot ensures the inoculant has a clean path into your jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13139591</next>\n<prev>13139552</prev>\n<first>13138362</first>\n<last>13139626</last>\n<when>1283469896</when>\n<utime>09/03/10 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
