That being said, stale and/or still air will also aid the growth of cobweb and trichoderma, the two most common contaminants in home mushroom culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fruiting chamber needs fresh, slightly moving air for best results, with the least contaminants.  There is no need to filter the air leading to a fruiting chamber.  A very small fan might help, but make sure it doesn't dry out the surface.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6091821</next>\n<prev>6089150</prev>\n<first>6089150</first>\n<last>6091821</last>\n<when>1158945378</when>\n<utime>09/22/06 08:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
