No fancy borders are needed, just ask them to over-stitch 3 times, so it would make it stronger and stitches wont open of broke. Tell them that you want the stitched on the “fur” side to get a pocket made of “satin”, so the gypsum dust wont stick on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kasha is probably the strongest kind of lining that exist and it’s used it high quality winter coat or other of that kind. It is made of a kind of Satin on a side and on the other it’s a kind of strong fiber looking a bit as velvet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't that going to cost more than the gypsum?&amp;nbsp; You're in a farming area.&amp;nbsp; You should be able to get ground gypsum from the same place the wheat farmers get theirs from.&amp;nbsp; For example, I get 1500 pounds of gypsum loaded into my pickup truck for $117, and it's already ground to the perfect texture for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call your local farm supply store or co-op and ask where the farmers buy gypsum to spread on their fields.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13746810</next>\n<prev>13746088</prev>\n<first>13745841</first>\n<last>13755143</last>\n<when>1294413664</when>\n<utime>01/07/11 05:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
