It doesn't mean &lt;i&gt;whatever temperature your room is&lt;/i&gt;. Normal room temperature is defined as 69F to 77F.&amp;nbsp; If your grow area is outside those parameters, then you need supplemental heat.&amp;nbsp; I'm 1,000 miles north of Colorado at elevation and it's already been below zero here.&amp;nbsp; We have a foot of snow on the ground, and I don't use 'incubators' but rather find a warm place indoors for my colonizing substrates.&amp;nbsp; I don't even have a thermostat to set.&amp;nbsp; Our cabin is heated with a wood stove, and the temperature is far from stable.&amp;nbsp; When we leave for a day, the fire goes out and the cabin is colder than shit when we get home.&amp;nbsp; This has never had a negative effect that I can tell on colonization.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium isn't as delicate as a newborn baby, which some people around here seem to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, don't wrap a light bulb with foil.&amp;nbsp; Usually, a cupboard above the refrigerator or stove will get you the right temperature range.&amp;nbsp; It's always warmer near the ceiling than near the floor.&amp;nbsp; Put that to work for you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11330812</next>\n<prev>11330773</prev>\n<first>11330549</first>\n<last>11330847</last>\n<when>1256661653</when>\n<utime>10/27/09 07:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
