Put wax paper over your trays to keep water droplets from landing on them.  With wax paper, you really don't need the humidity in the greenhouse over 70% to 80% because the wax paper will hold near 100% right on the casing surface.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've found short cycles work better for a humidifier than long cycles.  If you want a 2/1 ratio, try running it for half an hour, then off for fifteen minutes.  You can get 15 minute increment timers very cheap at hardware stores.  Short cycling will cut down on the excess moisture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5912138</next>\n<prev>5912123</prev>\n<first>5911829</first>\n<last>5920334</last>\n<when>1154202705</when>\n<utime>07/29/06 10:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
