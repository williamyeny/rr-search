{"key":"post-8024693","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8024693</id>\n<content>I've never seen much success with vertical logs.  The tops always seem to dry out, and the bottoms flood because water drains there by gravity. If you flip them every few days, the movement causes damage. Horizontal seems to work best.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've only had limited success dunking straw projects of any kind.  However, that's because I'm sandwiched between a temperate rain forest, and a real rain forest.  Trichoderma spores are rampant here.  If you live in a drier climate, you might have more success getting multiple flushes from straw.  For me, it's a one flush wonder.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8025824</next>\n<prev>8024301</prev>\n<first>8021021</first>\n<last>8073045</last>\n<when>1203050483</when>\n<utime>02/15/08 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
