By fine grade, I don't mean dust, but roughly 1mm pieces. Colonization speed isn't everything, final fruiting performance is.&amp;nbsp; There is more verm when it's ground fine than course, so it holds more water and provides more nutrition.&amp;nbsp; Less nutritious substrates always colonize faster, such as straw, but you have to use a lot more of it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16386279</next>\n<prev>16385995</prev>\n<first>16385916</first>\n<last>16387490</last>\n<when>1339796496</when>\n<utime>06/16/12 12:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
