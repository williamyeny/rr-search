I thought the purpose of using perlite was so the humidity in the terrarium was maintained, so that you DON'T have to mist. I thought the only reason for having a shotgun terrarium was to avoid CO2 build up. So now I have to use perlite with water AND mist? &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/confused.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:confused:&quot; title=&quot;:confused:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have to mist.&amp;nbsp; If the substrate is getting the proper amount of fresh air exchange, it will dry out, even at 99% humidity.&amp;nbsp; That's why you mist.&amp;nbsp; Misting is a major pinning trigger, because the substrate loses moisture to evaporation, and then you mist to replace it.&amp;nbsp; This change in moisture content helps to initiates fruiting.&amp;nbsp; A substrate that maintains a steady state-moisture content doesn't perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12336731</prev>\n<first>12327900</first>\n<last>12337403</last>\n<when>1270512680</when>\n<utime>04/06/10 03:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
