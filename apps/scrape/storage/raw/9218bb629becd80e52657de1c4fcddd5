Often, fruits on the same flush will be vastly different in potency, because more than one 'strain' may be active on the same substrate.&amp;nbsp; That's also why you might get a dud batch with horse manure, and the next inoculations on coir or brf cakes might be great, leading a new grower to mistakenly think it was the different substrate that resulted in the more potent fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8815793</next>\n<prev>8815446</prev>\n<first>8812977</first>\n<last>8821230</last>\n<when>1219519858</when>\n<utime>08/23/08 10:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
