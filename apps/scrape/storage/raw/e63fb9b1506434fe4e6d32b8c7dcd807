Surgical masks are designed to protect a patient from the bacteria being exhaled by the doctor during surgery, which is exactly what we need a mask for.  The surgical masks I get from a local drug store are clearly labeled  &quot;stops 99% of the wearers exhaled bacteria&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our mycology projects are not going to attack us with large partical size dust, such as floor sweepers or or someone running a concrete saw are going to be exposed to, but the bacteria we exhale with every breath can easily contaminate our needles, scalpels, inoculating loops and grain jars, as well as the whole general area we are working in.  Bacteria are single celled creatures and extremely small.  It takes a microscope to see them.  The bacteria in your breath will sail right through a dust mask like a gnat through a fishing net.  The micron size of a dust mask is simply too large to be effective against bacteria.  That's why they're not used in hospital surgery rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endospores are a survival tactic used by bacteria.  They are resplendant in grains, such as rye, wbs and corn.  If you'll soak your grains for a few hours to hydrate the endospores(as well as the grain kernels), they'll be easily killed in the PC, even if they haven't germinated yet.  Sometimes they survive the pressure cooker if that procedure is skipped.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;edited because I hate typos....lol&lt;/i&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5932391</next>\n<prev>5932257</prev>\n<first>5927534</first>\n<last>5941603</last>\n<when>1154739123</when>\n<utime>08/05/06 03:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
