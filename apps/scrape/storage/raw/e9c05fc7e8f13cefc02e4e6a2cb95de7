(W/O blowing the breaker or starting a fire, tyvm.)&lt;br /&gt;can i use an extension cord to wire this?&lt;br /&gt;if so, what colors go together? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i grow better than i construct flowhoods, i swear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be a data plate which will have the wiring diagram.&amp;nbsp; Post a picture of it.&amp;nbsp; Sounds like a multispeed motor, but you need the diagram to know which wires to hook up and which to tie together or insulate from each other.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12503875</next>\n<prev>12503548</prev>\n<first>12421555</first>\n<last>16428088</last>\n<when>1272986199</when>\n<utime>05/04/10 06:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
