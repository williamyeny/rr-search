I have had my hood for over a year now and have had no&lt;br /&gt;problems at all with the blower or anything for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furnace blowers are far superior to vortex fans.&amp;nbsp; Vortex fans are designed to deliver large amounts of air through a duct for the purpose of supplying or exhausting air.&amp;nbsp; The air from a vortex fan swirls through the duct just as water exits your toilet or smoke exits your chimney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is not suitable for a laminar flow hood where you want perfectly straight airflow and static pressure behind the filter, with a very low rate of flow.&amp;nbsp; Order a new furnace blower, or visit your local heat and air shop, and I'd venture a guess to say they have units out back in their bone yard which have been removed from customers homes when a new one was installed, and you could salvage a good blower from one of them cheaply.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15700949</next>\n<prev>15700882</prev>\n<first>15699547</first>\n<last>15728596</last>\n<when>1327245577</when>\n<utime>01/22/12 05:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
