The flame from a gas burner can curl around the kettle and up the sides, melting your bags that might be touching the surface.  You won't have that problem with electric.  Gas is fine, but watch that you don't turn it up too high.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6720793</next>\n<prev>6720098</prev>\n<first>6719849</first>\n<last>6721955</last>\n<when>1175108228</when>\n<utime>03/28/07 09:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
