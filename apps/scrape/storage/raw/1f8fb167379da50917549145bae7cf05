The green you see is only the spores.  The trichoderma mycelium is white.  It will take a few days for the mycelium to recover to make more spores.  It's a serious mistake to mess with the spores as you release tens of thousands of them into the air to contaminate your future projects.  When you see green early on in a project, you need to toss it out as soon as you see it.  Don't try to beat the green.  You only screw yourself for the future.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4392241</next>\n<prev>4391853</prev>\n<first>4384027</first>\n<last>4417019</last>\n<when>1121102530</when>\n<utime>07/11/05 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
