Cover them tightly with foil now, and in a few days they'll be ready to move to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; Just leave those deformed pins.&amp;nbsp; Pick the large ones off when you introduce to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; The smaller ones will probably develop normally once you add lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the ambient temp during colonization to 75F.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8946422</next>\n<prev>8946410</prev>\n<first>8946376</first>\n<last>8950829</last>\n<when>1221706375</when>\n<utime>09/18/08 05:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
