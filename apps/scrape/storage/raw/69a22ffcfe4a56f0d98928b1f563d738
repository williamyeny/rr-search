Mycelium growth drops off rapidy at 83F, and the temp inside the jar is several degrees warmer than the surrounding air.  I recommend room temperature incubation for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second most common cause of bacteria is inoculating without surgical gloves and/or mask.  There are millions of bacteria under your fingernails and on your skin, and milions more come out of your mouth with each breath.  Be sure to use a glovebox or flowhood during inoculations or any sterile work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6729962</next>\n<prev>6727966</prev>\n<first>6726148</first>\n<last>6733152</last>\n<when>1175279972</when>\n<utime>03/30/07 09:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
