So the environment is great, I just need some advice on the best way to do the sub using only what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not a great environment.&amp;nbsp; It will saturate your project and ruin it.&amp;nbsp; Evaporation from the substrate is necessary for good performance, so you never want a fog leaving your fruiting area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate and sterilize the oats, as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;grain preparation video&lt;/a&gt; and then inoculate them. Bear in mind, that's only a sample clip.&amp;nbsp; The full grain prep tek is on the DVD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fully colonized, you can mix with pasteurized or sterilized and hydrated verm, or a mix of verm and coir, verm and horse or cow manure, or straw.&amp;nbsp; Don't use chicken manure over about 5% of the total substrate if you use it as a supplement.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15471374</next>\n<prev>15470433</prev>\n<first>15468340</first>\n<last>15521708</last>\n<when>1323131065</when>\n<utime>12/06/11 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
