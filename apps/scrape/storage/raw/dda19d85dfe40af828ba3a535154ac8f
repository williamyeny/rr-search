If the culture dries out or otherwise 'dies' from being left too long, you can cut a section of the wood and place that on agar.  In most cases, the mycelium will recover from the wood and start growing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a complete section in my upcoming DVD already filmed on master slant preparation and use.  It won't be long now.  I'll have it released sometime this spring, I'm sure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6600571</next>\n<prev>6599100</prev>\n<first>6598478</first>\n<last>6601744</last>\n<when>1172198868</when>\n<utime>02/23/07 04:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
