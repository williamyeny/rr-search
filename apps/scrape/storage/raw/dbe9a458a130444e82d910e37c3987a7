Put in your misting bottle and spray the cobweb.  What you describe sounds like cobweb.  It will be very airy and fluffy, and seem to be above the casing, not really on it. It is grey, not white.  It will melt on contact with the peroxide.  The peroxide won't kill your mushrooms, but they don't appreciate it much either, so try to get as much on the cobweb and as little on your pins as possible.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4024499</next>\n<prev>4018391</prev>\n<first>4016983</first>\n<last>4125898</last>\n<when>1112766610</when>\n<utime>04/06/05 08:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
