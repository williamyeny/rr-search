There is no such thing as &quot;too much humidity&quot; as mushrooms absolutely thrive in 100% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get your humidity as high as you can, and provide plenty of fresh air exchange.  Get an analog hygrometer and properly calibrate it per hundreds of posts I've already made explaining how. Mist daily, and don't listen to those who would say not to mist the cake. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8318604</next>\n<prev>8318046</prev>\n<first>8316018</first>\n<last>8322398</last>\n<when>1208965710</when>\n<utime>04/23/08 06:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
