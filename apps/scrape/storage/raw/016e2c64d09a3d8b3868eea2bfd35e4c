It's not widely considered aesthetically pleasing, and it's one more thing to clean up after harvest. It won't harm you to eat it, but the chemical content is comparatively low.&lt;br /&gt;Cause: The most common reason cited for this is excess humidity in the fruiting chamber. Why the elevated humidity makes this happen, I do not know. I would think it would be excess CO2 levels &quot;tricking&quot; the mycelium to start looking for food (think high CO2 during colonization), but since there is none left in the substrate, it goes up the mushrooms' stems.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: If it's high humidity or gas levels, more FAE is the easy fix. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, stale air is the cause of fuzz on the stems.&amp;nbsp; It's not high CO2, or excess humidity, but you're correct that more fresh air is the cure.&amp;nbsp; Fuzzy stems are a good indicator that mold will soon follow if one fails to increase fresh air supply.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14510210</next>\n<prev>14508685</prev>\n<first>14508610</first>\n<last>26739034</last>\n<when>1306330510</when>\n<utime>05/25/11 04:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
