I've got a microscope picture of a slide I made by scraping the spores onto the slide with a scalpel.  Almost all have major damage from the sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have an inoculating loop, you can easily make one with a piece of wire.  The idea is to gently transfer the spores with the round part of the wire so you don't cut them to shreds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7332362</next>\n<prev>7332341</prev>\n<first>7332297</first>\n<last>7332834</last>\n<when>1188054508</when>\n<utime>08/25/07 06:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
