The inside of the fridge is colder than the outside whereas in the terrarium the opposite is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The temperature differential in the terrarium's case is much smaller than the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can observe the condensation without opening the terrarium. You aren't causing a sudden drastic temperature differential like you are by removing the beer from the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn't apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. The inside of the fridge is colder than the outside whereas in the terrarium the opposite is true.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The beer from the fridge gets condensation on the warm side of the temp differential.&amp;nbsp; The beer is cold, the air touching the can is warm, thus condensation forms on the warm side of the differential, JUST LIKE in a terrarium where the condensation forms on the warm side.&amp;nbsp; It's the exact same principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;2. The temperature differential in the terrarium's case is much smaller than the fridge.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;3. You can observe the condensation without opening the terrarium. You aren't causing a sudden drastic temperature differential like you are by removing the beer from the fridge.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Speed of temp change is not a factor.&amp;nbsp; When air cools to the dewpoint, condensation will form whether or not it happened fast of slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has gotten completely childish and ridiculous. If you want to argue, take it to OTD.&amp;nbsp; If you have a valid point to make that's founded in science, then make it with science to back up your claims.&amp;nbsp; A few others have chimed in to tell you how to determine dew point, how it's reached, and what happens when it is.&amp;nbsp; You're arguing the indefensible point that condensation on the walls is an indicator of high humidity in a terrarium, which it is not, regardless of who has made the same mistake before.&amp;nbsp; My terrariums are all sitting at 95% or greater, and not one of them has a single drop of condensation on the walls.&amp;nbsp; However, I can take a sealed-up rubbermaid, put perlite and substrates in it, and shortly after I turn on the light overhead, condensation will form on the sides.&amp;nbsp; Why? Temperature differential-It's warmer inside the terrarium than outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest any new growers to purchase a few analog hygrometers and calibrate them properly via the damp towel method weekly.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, discussions like this one give the impression to new growers that humidity is the most important factor in growing mushrooms, which it isn't.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11206680</next>\n<prev>11206219</prev>\n<first>11137114</first>\n<last>12071512</last>\n<when>1255013268</when>\n<utime>10/08/09 05:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
