Released starches are bad for colonization, bad for shaking because they cause clumping, and burst kerels are bad for spawning to bulk where they easily get infected during mixing with manure or straw and contaminate at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be zero burst kernels.  Allow yourself a bit of fudge room there, but if you soak the grains for 24 hours, you can bring it to a rapid boil without bursting any kernels.  The key is in the soak, as it hydrates the grains slowly, while softening the kernels so they don't burst.  Be sure to begin the soak after rinsing the grains well, with hot tap water.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever saw even a 10% burst rate, I'd do it over.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6233349</next>\n<prev>6232614</prev>\n<first>6230415</first>\n<last>6246518</last>\n<when>1162357972</when>\n<utime>11/01/06 07:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
