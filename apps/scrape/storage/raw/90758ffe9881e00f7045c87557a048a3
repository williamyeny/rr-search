Tighten it down after it cools. Forcing steam through that little hole in the filter like that isn't good for the filter membrane and could pop the filter right off the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly disagree.&amp;nbsp; I never leave bands loose and never have.&amp;nbsp; Steam isn't forced out through the inoculation hole.&amp;nbsp; The steam pressure inside the jar rises and falls with the steam level in the pressure cooker outside the jar.&amp;nbsp; There is never more pressure in the jar than outside unless someone incorrectly pulls the weight off at the end of the cycle to dump steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, you can put a solid lid on without holes and screw the ring down tight.&amp;nbsp; I do this all the time when I need sterile water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18407345</next>\n<prev>18407023</prev>\n<first>18406509</first>\n<last>18409217</last>\n<when>1371037654</when>\n<utime>06/12/13 02:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
