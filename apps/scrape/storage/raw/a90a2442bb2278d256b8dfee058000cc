{"key":"post-8948499","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8948499</id>\n<content>I went a step beyond that and bought a brass radiator drain valve from a local auto parts store for $3 and screwed it on where the nozzle for the weight originally was.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is zero safety with that valve, but I don't drink when sterilizing anyway.&amp;nbsp; I just open it for the first ten minutes to allow steam to escape, and then close it 'almost' all the way during the cycle.&amp;nbsp; I still prefer a slight amount of steam to escape during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the cycle, I turn off the stove and shut the valve completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety sake, I don't recommend this setup if you're prone to getting wasted when working, but then again, if you are, you won't last long in this hobby anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8948603</next>\n<prev>8948461</prev>\n<first>8938387</first>\n<last>8958160</last>\n<when>1221752680</when>\n<utime>09/18/08 06:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
