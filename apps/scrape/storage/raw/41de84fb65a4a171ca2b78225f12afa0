Coir runs pH 5 to pH 6.5 depending on origin.  Acids &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; pH, not raise them.  I've found no evidence that coffee boosts potency.  It does however, speed up colonization, because it's excellent fungi food.  In addition, the lower pH results in faster growth because Cubensis &lt;i&gt;prefers&lt;/i&gt; a substrate in the pH 5.5 to pH 6 range.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a substrate with an acidic pH like yours results in faster colonization and better performance overall, but also exposes the project to an increased risk of contamination, because molds such as trichoderma also prefer an acidic food source. In my area, the mold spore count is so high, I'd never be able to get a substrate that had been hydrated with liquid coffee colonized before parts of it were green from molds.  Hopefully, yours will work out.  It's almost colonized.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7558313</next>\n<prev>7558093</prev>\n<first>7557255</first>\n<last>7648614</last>\n<when>1193320734</when>\n<utime>10/25/07 04:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
