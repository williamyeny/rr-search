In addition, the static electricity can easily wipe out your electronics if you touch them and draw a spark.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've now tested the shotgun terrarium down to 30% humidity, and it still maintained 95% humidity. I won't attempt to test it lower than that because I refuse to live in a house that is drier than that. However, the biggest mistake new growers make is thinking humidity is more important than constant fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger, and you can always mist to make up for the loss, which is what you're supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9812027</next>\n<prev>9811101</prev>\n<first>9810950</first>\n<last>9813625</last>\n<when>1234852567</when>\n<utime>02/17/09 08:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
