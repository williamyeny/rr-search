I however, add it to the soak water.  In the three gallons of water/coffee I use to soak ten cups of rye berries, I add one teaspoon of hydrated lime and one tablespoon of gypsum.  This allows the gypsum to be absorbed into the berries where it will be available long term for the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5036534</prev>\n<first>5036243</first>\n<last>5036572</last>\n<when>1134105039</when>\n<utime>12/09/05 07:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
