{"key":"post-5988893","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5988893</id>\n<content>There is no competition between strains of the same species. They either stay separate and do their own things, or combine by anastomosis into one organism.  It happens all the time in nature, and in fact with multispore inoculation, you already have hundreds if not thousands of strains germinating anyway.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't mix the two just for the reason that if you keep them separate, you can see the differences, if any, between them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5989012</next>\n<prev>5988808</prev>\n<first>5988730</first>\n<last>5989153</last>\n<when>1156344000</when>\n<utime>08/23/06 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
