Simply use your spores to inoculate the grains.  LC has applications if you plan to grow truckloads, but for homegrowers, it's a waste, imo.  You only expose yourself double to the chance of contaminants by excessive handling.  Much more effective and safe is to learn grain to grain transfers.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5958838</next>\n<prev>5958696</prev>\n<first>5958518</first>\n<last>5959587</last>\n<when>1155488284</when>\n<utime>08/13/06 07:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
