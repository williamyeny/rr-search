What they do is when they know that magic mushrooms are growing on their property they want to get rid of them for obvious security reasons. So they spay the FIELD to kill the magic mushrooms not the poop, because all they have to do is kill all remaining spores and myc. Which is quite easy and inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the biggest line of crap.&amp;nbsp; Geezus.&amp;nbsp; Don't just make shit up and post it here please.&amp;nbsp; They do often put fungicides on grains, but it's to stop it from molding in damp barns during long storage periods, not to prevent mushrooms growing on the manure produced by the cows.&amp;nbsp; Besides, cows eat hay and grass in the fields, not grains.&amp;nbsp; The grains are mostly fed in the feed lots to fatten up the steers just before slaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't spray fields or feed to stop kids from picking mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; This is an urban myth that's been around since I was a kid in the 1950s and '60s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fungicides don't kill live mycelium either.&amp;nbsp; If you pick all the mushrooms in a patch over a year or two, you can destroy the field.&amp;nbsp; However, the mushrooms will pop up in an adjacent or nearby field.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17157878</next>\n<prev>17156722</prev>\n<first>17156537</first>\n<last>17159072</last>\n<when>1352025894</when>\n<utime>11/04/12 12:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
