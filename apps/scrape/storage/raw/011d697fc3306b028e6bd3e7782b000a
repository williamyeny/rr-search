I'll have to adjust FAE to match what the ground can heat as it enters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost 300 watts of 6,000 Kelvin to 7,000 Kelvin LEDs in stock, so I'll use what is necessary and replace fluorescent and incandescent lamps in our cabin and barns with the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three solar panels for the grow room.&amp;nbsp; If I need more, I'll get them, but I don't want batteries due to the lead content, whether they can be recycled or not.&amp;nbsp; The nearest battery recycler is a 5 hour drive, so they're out.&amp;nbsp; When the sun comes up, my lights will come on, and when the sun goes down, it will be dark.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10416715</next>\n<prev>10416646</prev>\n<first>10413482</first>\n<last>10445761</last>\n<when>1243571178</when>\n<utime>05/29/09 07:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
