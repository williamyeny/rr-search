You'll want a slightly acid pH around 6 to 6.5, and some outdoor, non-pasteurized soil to provide the micro organisms.  Fruiting/primordia forming temps are best in the 50's.  Most growers fruit them outdoors for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7590828</prev>\n<first>7590689</first>\n<last>7591004</last>\n<when>1194116434</when>\n<utime>11/03/07 10:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
