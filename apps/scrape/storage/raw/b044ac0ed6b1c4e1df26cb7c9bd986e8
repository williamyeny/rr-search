If the molds are growing from the inoculation points, they were introduced later, either through not sterilizing the needle, or a contaminated syringe.  Always use a glovebox if you don't have a flowhood.  Remember, mold and bacteria are everywhere in the air around you, and when you breathe and especially when you talk, millions of bacteria leave your mouth.
