{"key":"post-5090104","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5090104</id>\n<content>No.&lt;br /&gt;Two reasons.  One, mag is not good for mushrooms.  Many growers have reported problems with fruiting whenever high levels of magnesium are present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, dolomitic lime is very slow to break down and is intended for outdoor flowerbeds and lawns where it has all season to work.  For balancing a casing, we need a very fast acting lime that goes to work right away since the average life of a casing is measured in weeks, not months or years.  I recommend hydrated lime.  You can get it online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt; if it's not available in your area. When you get to their site, just do a search for 'hydrated lime'.  I use the 'good earth' brand.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5090414</next>\n<prev>5090071</prev>\n<first>5090071</first>\n<last>5090418</last>\n<when>1135198520</when>\n<utime>12/21/05 10:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
