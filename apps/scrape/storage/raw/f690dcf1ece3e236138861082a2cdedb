I've fruited uncased horse manure and it works just fine, usually setting pins within a few days of initiation.  You probably just have a poor fruiting strain, so give it a bit longer and you should see something.  If your humidity is less that 99% you can lay a wrinkled up sheet of wax paper over the tray to create a mini environment just about the substrate surface.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6228433</next>\n<prev>6227907</prev>\n<first>6227425</first>\n<last>6228433</last>\n<when>1162264586</when>\n<utime>10/31/06 05:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
