You likely waterlogged your substrate, then in the high humidity of the monotub that moisture had nowhere to go.  Remember, your substrate needs to be &lt;i&gt;losing&lt;/i&gt; moisture in order to get the best pinset.  A waterlogged substrate will perform poorly, as people who have set their cakes directly on perlite in a terrarium can attest.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6182341</next>\n<prev>6180127</prev>\n<first>6178043</first>\n<last>6182341</last>\n<when>1161141032</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
