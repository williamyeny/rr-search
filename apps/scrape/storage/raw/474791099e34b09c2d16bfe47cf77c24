But there doesn't seem to be much sporulation: I'll see maybe one tiny spot of green on the side of the casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try and dig it out - and then wham, the whole spot around it has been eaten by this grayish shit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's cobweb mold.&amp;nbsp; The culprit is you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't count how many times I've said to NEVER ATTEMPT TO CUT OUT MOLD.&amp;nbsp; All that does is spread it around your house, clothes, skin, etc., making the problem ten times worse, and then contaminating future grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as people try to cut out mold, we're going to have people who can no longer grow in their homes because they've totally coated the walls and everything with contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you move into a new place, be sure to toss out any contaminated substrate without disturbing it, so you don't ruin your grow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;boommer said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also if u get contams remember to spray lysol the endospores of the mold can be everywhere even airborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold doesn't make endospores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15665531</next>\n<prev>15665334</prev>\n<first>15665234</first>\n<last>15665538</last>\n<when>1326572934</when>\n<utime>01/14/12 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
