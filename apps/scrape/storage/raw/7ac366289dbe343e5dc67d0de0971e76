It prevents most of your substrate from being turned &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; CO2.  Without proper covering, up to 50% or more of the carbon in your substate will be released as CO2 gas by the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, many competitor fungi can't thrive in the high CO2 environment, thus it helps favor for mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7585280</next>\n<prev>7585188</prev>\n<first>7584676</first>\n<last>7586795</last>\n<when>1193966246</when>\n<utime>11/02/07 04:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
