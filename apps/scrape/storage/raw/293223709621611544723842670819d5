Aquarium air pumps and stones don't provide enough fresh air, so that's set you back.&amp;nbsp; Fruiting chambers should have no standing water in the perlite.&amp;nbsp; You're not supposed to give light for 24 hours per day, so that's setting you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that, you're wondering why it's not fruiting after only five days?&amp;nbsp; Five days is about right to expect pins when you do every thing right.&amp;nbsp; Quit fixing what isn't broken(cold shock-scratching), and read some more.&amp;nbsp; Good luck and welcome to the board.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9089126</next>\n<prev>9089085</prev>\n<first>9088469</first>\n<last>9089292</last>\n<when>1224216213</when>\n<utime>10/17/08 07:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
