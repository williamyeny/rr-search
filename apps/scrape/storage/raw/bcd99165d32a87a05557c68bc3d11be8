Part of the time you're counting as 'fruiting' is the time spent colonizing that last 20%, and then the mycelium has to 'consolidate' its hold on the substrate, so more time is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain verm is the worst possible casing layer.  It's only marginally better than fruiting uncased.  You'll get much better performance from peat-verm, buffered to raise the pH, and with up to ten percent by volume of horticultural grade gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7710026</next>\n<prev>7710012</prev>\n<first>7709925</first>\n<last>7710096</last>\n<when>1196699222</when>\n<utime>12/03/07 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
