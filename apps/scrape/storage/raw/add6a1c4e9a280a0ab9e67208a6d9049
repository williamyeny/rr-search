We're still killing them..lol  About all you can do is get some fresh rye.  They're a seasonal thing, so once they finish hatching out, they're done.  Get rid of anything that is breeding them, and that includes your bag of grain.  Go get a fresh one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6659515</next>\n<prev>6658820</prev>\n<first>6658820</first>\n<last>6659839</last>\n<when>1173654119</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 02:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
