I can't imagine a reason why that horrible disinformation refuses to die.  It defies rational thought.  Fungi in the wild doesn't grow in total darkness, so why should it be necessary in our cultivation?  In all my years, I've never noticed a cow looking for a spot in total darkness to drop its load.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8046410</prev>\n<first>8046359</first>\n<last>8046420</last>\n<when>1203523573</when>\n<utime>02/20/08 06:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
