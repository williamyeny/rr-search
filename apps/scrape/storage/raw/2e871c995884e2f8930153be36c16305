At Blue Water Alchemy we make this Ormus from premium Dead Sea Salt. We believe this was the Ormus of the Essenes, the Ormus of creativity and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Ormus I used to empower my mental, emotional and physical self, transitioning from dis-ease to wellness. It is named White Light because of my first personal experience with Ormus when it called out to me in my visions and dreams. It appeared above me as a liquid of White Light as I stood in a great void entering my body as I opened my mouth to it. The Dead Sea is blended with Celtic, New Zealand and Bolivian Rose salts to make the White Light. It is a very balanced Ormus with a wonderful high powerful energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a very powerful Ormus made from the Himalayan and Peruvian Bolivian salts where it is believed the Kundalini of the earth moves back and forth. During the development of this blend both the Red Eye and Blue Eye were appearing in the etheric field thus it's name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they didn't separate you from any money.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19543380</next>\n<prev>19541173</prev>\n<first>19541169</first>\n<last>19543380</last>\n<when>1391920058</when>\n<utime>02/09/14 06:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
