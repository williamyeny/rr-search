It holds far less water. When the mycelium senses it's running out of moisture, the survival mechanism of sclerotia production kicks into gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make your grains too wet, they often get taken over by bacteria no matter how clean you are.  Remember, sterilization is never complete.  It would take 24 hours or more at 15 psi to completely sterilize a jar of grain, but that would turn it to mush and make it unusable.  Therefore, it's important to make sure our jars get colonized as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High temperatures also stimulate bacteria, so I incubate everything at normal room temperature.  Search around for my rye grain tek.  I've typed it out a bunch of times.  It will work great for grain spawn or sclerotia.  The key is to have the kernels double the original dry size, while totally dry feeling and looking on the surface. A tablespoon of rye ready to load into jars should not leave a wet spot on a sheet of toilet paper, if left there for 15 seconds. However you go about getting the above will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee seems to stimulate sclerotia production, so use 1/2 drinking strength coffee to hydrate your grains.  Add a tablespoon of gypsum to each 3 gallons of soak water, or if you prefer, add a pinch between your thumb and forefinger to each jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6461657</next>\n<prev>6461359</prev>\n<first>6459326</first>\n<last>6462302</last>\n<when>1168874632</when>\n<utime>01/15/07 05:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
