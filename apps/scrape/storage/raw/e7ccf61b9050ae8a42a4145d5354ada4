A bit of fermenting is ok, but if it smells rancid, toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you really need to do with the soak is soften up the grains for three or four hours so they don't burst when you simmer.  Endospores are over-worried about, except with popcorn which is full of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short soak, simmer, then 90 minutes in the PC for quart jars or 60 minutes for pints is fine for steriliztion.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>21238630</next>\n<prev>6010106</prev>\n<first>6010106</first>\n<last>21239368</last>\n<when>1156910426</when>\n<utime>08/30/06 07:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
