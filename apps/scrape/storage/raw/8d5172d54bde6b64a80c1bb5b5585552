I'd recommend you bury your spent cakes in your garden if you have one, otherwise break them up and put into your houseplants.  The houseplants will do better because the mycelium will break down the nutes and make them available to the plants.  You'll even get a mushie or two every now and then.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3012423</next>\n<prev>3012383</prev>\n<first>3012383</first>\n<last>22659024</last>\n<when>1092750411</when>\n<utime>08/17/04 04:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
