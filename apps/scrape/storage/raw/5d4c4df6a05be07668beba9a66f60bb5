Gotta be careful about moisture when using a syringe into a quart of grain.  Don't get it too wet.  Shoot it on the glass at the edges so it can run down.  This spreads the spores over a larger area than shooting down the middle. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1485949</next>\n<prev>1483214</prev>\n<first>1483136</first>\n<last>1488509</last>\n<when>1051120058</when>\n<utime>04/23/03 08:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
