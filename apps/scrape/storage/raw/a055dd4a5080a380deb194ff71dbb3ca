{"key":"post-7130043","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7130043</id>\n<content>You should never shake pf type jars because it ruins the verm filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grains should NOT be shaked after inoculation with spores.  Monokaryotic mycelium grows far slower than dikaryotic mycelium.  It's best to inject the spores and leave them to pair up in close proximity to each other.  Once they pair up and become dikaryotic, shake once to distribute the grains, which speeds up colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using liquid mycelium, or a grain to grain transfer, shake at inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using an agar wedge, it's also best not to shake for a few days.  Allow the mycelium to crawl off the agar wedge and into a few dozen kernels of grain, then shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure to follow the above does not mean your project will fail.  It just means it may take a few extra days to achieve full colonization.  I arrived at these conclusions after a few thousand inoculations, trying it each way many times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7130054</next>\n<prev>7130009</prev>\n<first>7125379</first>\n<last>7130350</last>\n<when>1183606883</when>\n<utime>07/05/07 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
