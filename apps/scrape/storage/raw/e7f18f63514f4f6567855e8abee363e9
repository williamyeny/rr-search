You can get it from fungi.com or amazon.com.  I've also seen it in barnes and noble, and head shops everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds and bacteria are everywhere in the air.  Up to a million of em per cubic foot.  That's a lot.  It's why sterile procedures are so important.  Any sterile cereal grain that is exposed to the open air is going to grow a ton of mold.  That's why you can't birth the cakes until they're fully colonized with mushroom mycelium.  At that point, the mushroom mycelium will be able to fight off the invaders.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6066178</prev>\n<first>6064567</first>\n<last>6066310</last>\n<when>1158376356</when>\n<utime>09/16/06 06:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
