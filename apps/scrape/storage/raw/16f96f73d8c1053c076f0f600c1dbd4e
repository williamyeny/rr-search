Cubensis won't win over bacteria.  Other species such as the highly antibiotic P ostreatus will eat bacteria for lunch.  Attention to sterile procedure is the answer.  I use fine verm, and it's good for the filter and brf mix.  The key is not to introduce bacteria from your hands, the air in the room, and especially your own breath when inoculating the jars.  Leave the tape and foil off the holes in pf jars after inoculation.  As hyphae said, the lids can be loosened as well for extra gas exchange, since the verm barrier is the filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6936458</next>\n<prev>6935728</prev>\n<first>6935668</first>\n<last>6936458</last>\n<when>1179534084</when>\n<utime>05/19/07 03:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
