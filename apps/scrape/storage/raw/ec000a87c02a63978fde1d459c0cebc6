You can get them locally in most places, or order a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;pre-wired line voltage thermostat online&lt;/a&gt;.(scroll down to &lt;i&gt;ACF pre-wired thermostat&lt;/i&gt; on that page)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every hardware/electrical store in the country will have 'line voltage thermostats' where the ambient temperature switches a set of contacts rated at 120V/240V which will operate the heater without relays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still say to move the whole operation inside your house and forget the dog and pony show of trying to grow in a shed during winter.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing to be worried about growing oyster mushrooms for food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9537105</next>\n<prev>9537039</prev>\n<first>9534162</first>\n<last>21209321</last>\n<when>1231003247</when>\n<utime>01/03/09 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
