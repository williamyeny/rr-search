Chances are, the millions of green mold spores that are escaping those jars are going to contaminate the jars stacked right next to them.  There's a limit to how much a verm barrier or filter can protect you.  Even if it's 99.99% effective, it will still allow .001% of the contaminants either in or out.  with trillions of green spores showing there, that's a lot of contaminants to be releasing into your room just for a picture.  Toss those jars without opening, or PC for a couple of hours first if you wish to save the jars themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often the 'marshmellow' look is bacteria contamination.  If the cake smells like anything but fresh mushrooms, toss it out too, or bury in your garden soil outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5892075</next>\n<prev>5891890</prev>\n<first>5879443</first>\n<last>5892123</last>\n<when>1153704018</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
