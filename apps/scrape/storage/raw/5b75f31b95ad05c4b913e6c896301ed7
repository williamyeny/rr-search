Rinse, then while dripping wet, roll in dry vermiculite so it will stick by absorbing the moisture on the side of the cake. I do it by placing the cakes in a large bowl of vermiculite and sweeping the verm by hand over the cake that way. You want a solid layer of vermiculite covering the cake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you've placed the cakes into the terrarium, mist heavily so that you completely soak and saturate the vermiculite.  It then becomes a moisture reservoir as well as a sort of mini-casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6456369</next>\n<prev>6456329</prev>\n<first>6456243</first>\n<last>6462579</last>\n<when>1168736083</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 02:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
