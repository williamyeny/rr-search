Wbs will do fine if you spawn it to manure or coir when fully colonized.  Case with peat-verm.  Don't use a casing layer on the bottom.  It goes on the top, and plain vermiculite makes a poor casing.  Adding peat, or even a small amount of coir will deliver a lot more bang for ya.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6607126</next>\n<prev>6606972</prev>\n<first>6606908</first>\n<last>6607323</last>\n<when>1172382021</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 07:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
