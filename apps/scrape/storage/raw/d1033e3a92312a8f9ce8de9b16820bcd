Mine and many other grower's experiments have shown that more growth occurs during the dark cycle.&amp;nbsp; My original time-lapse photos were so screwed by the dark period that the mushrooms appeared to jump in the first picture after lights on.&amp;nbsp; Later, I put my light on a cycle timer so it would come on for 20 seconds for each picture.&amp;nbsp; That cured the jerky pictures but slowed down total growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms do not grow well with low level or no light.&amp;nbsp; The do 'grow' but are light in weight, skinny with long stems and very tiny caps.&amp;nbsp; Potency in psilocybin mushrooms is notably lower when insufficient light is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;shroomdust said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will grow decent with no light except for what they get when fanning and misting. I don't think light is as big of a deal as people make it out to be. They derive energy from the nutrients in the substrate. They are not plants and do not use photosynthesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuo will never get a proper flush from a substrate without a proper light cycle. Mushrooms do utilize light in the fruiting process, just not in the same way as plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants.&amp;nbsp; They use light in a different way, just as us humans do.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms do indeed derive energy from light-They double or more in size and weight when exposed to the proper amount over being grown in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19216396</next>\n<prev>19215836</prev>\n<first>19214548</first>\n<last>19250123</last>\n<when>1385989738</when>\n<utime>12/02/13 03:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
