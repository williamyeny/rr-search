I have been looking at the pins and using the way they look as an indication to determine if I need to mist. Like if they are glossy, I don't mist, but if the glossiness is gone when I look, I mist again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not the indicator you look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, you don't mist to give humidity.&amp;nbsp; That's the job your perlite does.&amp;nbsp; You mist to replace the moisture that has evaporated from the substrate because of the fresh air being supplied.&amp;nbsp; Misting up in the air does little good.&amp;nbsp; You should be misting the cake directly so the substrate will absorb the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your mushrooms are growing very slowly, it could be due to cakes being too dry, or too wet.&amp;nbsp; Both will present as slow growth.&amp;nbsp; The way to tell moisture content is to pick the cakes up and judge by the weight.&amp;nbsp; If they're dry and light, set them in a saucer of water overnight, even with pins.&amp;nbsp; If they're heavy and wet, leave the lid off the fruiting chamber for a day or so to let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15073751</next>\n<prev>15073637</prev>\n<first>15073511</first>\n<last>15086191</last>\n<when>1315949238</when>\n<utime>09/14/11 12:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
