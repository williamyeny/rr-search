I use steel tie wire and twist the tops like a loaf of bread.  However, even with all that production, I still use quart jars for grains.  The bags are for the woodchips/sawdust which really can't be done in jars because of the size of the chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with Agar and see no advantage whatsoever for home growers to use bags for grains over jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6417603</prev>\n<first>6417235</first>\n<last>6417804</last>\n<when>1167760887</when>\n<utime>01/02/07 08:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
