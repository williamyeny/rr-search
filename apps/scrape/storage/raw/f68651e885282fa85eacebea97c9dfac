It might just be listed as lawn and turf seed or something similar.  You have to look at the back to see what kind it is.  Last time I bought a bag of mixed grass seed that was only about half rye.  It worked fine, but I still get as much sclerotia from rye berries as from grass seed, if not more.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6057333</prev>\n<first>6056056</first>\n<last>6057509</last>\n<when>1158182571</when>\n<utime>09/14/06 12:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
