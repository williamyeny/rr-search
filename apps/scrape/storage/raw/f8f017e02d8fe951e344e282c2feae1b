Cobweb is grey, not white and very airy.  It sometimes even appears to be 'floating' just above the surface.  Spray with full strength 3% peroxide right out of the bottle.  If the mold disolves instantly on contact, it was cobweb.  If not, you just pissed off your mycelium, but it will get over it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5533090</prev>\n<first>5533090</first>\n<last>5536187</last>\n<when>1145514708</when>\n<utime>04/20/06 09:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
