I could be wrong about how much it might of gotten exposed to 100% humidity outside. I could also argue that pinning did not start when expected due to being too wet during my tweaking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most areas, the humidity goes to near 100% at night and early morning.&amp;nbsp; Also, a day/night temperature change is a MAJOR pinning trigger that most indoor growers don't take advantage of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are correct.&amp;nbsp; A too-wet substrate will not pin.&amp;nbsp; It's also more likely to get moldy, so you got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12451274</next>\n<prev>12450854</prev>\n<first>12449786</first>\n<last>12451526</last>\n<when>1272157764</when>\n<utime>04/25/10 04:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
