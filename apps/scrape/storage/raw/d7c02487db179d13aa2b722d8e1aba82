This is the basic philosophy behind a mono-tub and why it works.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of physics understanding by members here is underwhelming at times.&amp;nbsp; CO2 mixes with the air as science has known for centuries.&amp;nbsp; It does not settle to the bottom of a ventilated tub, nor does it get 'pushed out' bottom holes. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO2 mixes with the air and goes where the air does.&amp;nbsp; In my mushroom farm, the CO2 level is 200 ppm higher near the ceilings than near the floor.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because of convection and the fact that warm and humid air rises.&amp;nbsp; When the CO2 mixes with this warm and humid air, it rises too.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Substrates create heat.&amp;nbsp; Lighting creates heat.&amp;nbsp; These factors cause convection in the tub.&amp;nbsp; Nobody can map exactly what the currents are doing because they'll constantly change based on ambient weather conditions of humidity and atmospheric pressure, as well as whether your light is on or off, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17963881</next>\n<prev>17963517</prev>\n<first>17962236</first>\n<last>24369424</last>\n<when>1363441454</when>\n<utime>03/16/13 04:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
