RR, how did you germinate the spore on the slide? Is it just a luck thing? Do you add nutrients the water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make slides with 4% karo mixed with 96% water.&amp;nbsp; Put the spores down on one drop of karo/water solution, then lay a cover slip over that.&amp;nbsp; Spores start to germinate within an hour or two.&amp;nbsp; You can see about 30 pictures like the above in my gallery, taken every 20 minutes as the hyphae expands and grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheapie microscopes are really not worth the money.&amp;nbsp; Invest in a pressure cooker and flowhood instead.&amp;nbsp; When you get ready to move up to microscopy, get a good scope with large objectives.&amp;nbsp; A decent scope will set you back $2K or more, but is worth it.&amp;nbsp; I have two or three $500 scopes sitting out in the barn getting bird shit on them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11046999</next>\n<prev>11043434</prev>\n<first>11040470</first>\n<last>11048509</last>\n<when>1252772094</when>\n<utime>09/12/09 07:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
