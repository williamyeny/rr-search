{"key":"post-7598084","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7598084</id>\n<content>A couple of points that would help new growers get proper answers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't ask questions about 'jars'.  Jars are plain glass and nothing grows on glass.  It's important to say what's INside the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it's best to follow established procedures for your first few grows.  Let those who have grown before show you how by reading the established and respected teks.  Once you have a few grows under your belt, experiment away because it's how we learn new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to let 'jars' sit after sterilization.  If you followed proper sterilization procedure, the contents of your jars are sterile(&lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;), so don't second guess your pressure cooker.  Inoculate as soon as they've cooled, or at least within 24 hours.  No sterilization is ever &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt;, but rather it only gives a window for the mushroom mycelium to get a foothold before the surviving contaminants do.  Waiting to inoculate decreases your odds of success.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7598104</next>\n<prev>7598024</prev>\n<first>7597890</first>\n<last>7598220</last>\n<when>1194286914</when>\n<utime>11/05/07 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
