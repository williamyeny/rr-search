More chance of contamination yes, but only if you're using a substrate that the contamination can digest easily. Brown rice flour for example is easy for the molds to digest while cow poop isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you suggesting that people inject spores directly into cow manure?&amp;nbsp; If you inject a lot of mold spores into brf or grains, they'll grow much faster than the mushroom spores and will take over the project.&amp;nbsp; If you inject spores directly into manure, nothing will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;InTheRainySeason said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So by telling people to use less spores per syringe and use the pf tek, people that sell spores are making a shitload of money cause the people that buy from them get contaminations and have to buy more. I think they want you to fail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is absolute nonsense.&amp;nbsp; No vendor wants anyone to fail using their product, and I also advise to use less spores per syringe, and I sure as hell don't want to see people fail when following my guidance.&amp;nbsp; Don't even insinuate such a thing.&amp;nbsp; Every print has some contamination unless it was taken in outer space.&amp;nbsp; The more mold spores you inject into a substrate, the more the chance of failure becomes, because molds grow much faster than mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;InTheRainySeason said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, when they sell a spore syringe with one sixteenth of a spore print in it, they'll make a shitload more money that way than if they just sold a syringe for the same price but with a whole print in it, or half a print, or one eight of a print. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One normal sized print is the correct amount to use for up to ten syringes.&amp;nbsp; More spores are not better.&amp;nbsp; Many strains are non-compatible and therefore don't merge into a common organism via the process of anastomosis.&amp;nbsp; The least amount of spores you can use is best, since even one print to ten syringes gives millions of spores per syringe.&amp;nbsp; Hundreds of millions of spores is NOT better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9596661</next>\n<prev>9596281</prev>\n<first>9594584</first>\n<last>9601317</last>\n<when>1231805804</when>\n<utime>01/13/09 02:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
