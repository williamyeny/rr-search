I don't believe I've ever said that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms grown in total darkness will grow straight up, opposite gravity. Mushrooms grow towards light because they're using it as an energy source.&amp;nbsp; They use the energy from light to convert sugars in the substrate to ATP within the cells, is what you were looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the mycelium has all the nutrition it needs, but lacks light, the caps will be small.&amp;nbsp; Add light and you get the most bang.&amp;nbsp; This is really being driven home to me in my Shiitake mushroom farm.&amp;nbsp; I have LED light rope over each shelf, but at the top of the grow room is several LED spotlights shooting down.&amp;nbsp; The upper shelves which receive the brightest light have mushrooms on average double in size from those on the darker bottom shelves.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13087621</next>\n<prev>13087383</prev>\n<first>13085841</first>\n<last>13149636</last>\n<when>1282521011</when>\n<utime>08/23/10 02:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
