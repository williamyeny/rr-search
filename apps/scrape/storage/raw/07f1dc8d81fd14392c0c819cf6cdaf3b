If the changes are rapid, they can easily be too much for the filtering material, especially if only dry verm is used.  I don't recommend incubators, but find a nice room that holds at least to within five degrees or so.  75F to 81F is ideal. Above that, the returns are not worth the increased rate of contamination that will be experienced.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7829363</next>\n<prev>7829331</prev>\n<first>7829107</first>\n<last>7829419</last>\n<when>1199415950</when>\n<utime>01/04/08 05:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
