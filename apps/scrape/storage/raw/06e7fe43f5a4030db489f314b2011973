We apply it as a layer over the top of our substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no need to throw away anything with cobweb mold.  It is about the only contaminant that is actually easy to recover from. Simply spray 3% peroxide right from the bottle and watch the cobweb disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the post above, cobweb mold can not live in an environment with fresh, moving air.  It only grows in stale, still air.  Cobweb is prevented by proper air exchange.  Cobweb spores also die at 120F, so a simple pasteurization is sure to kill them off. Giod luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>24239121</next>\n<prev>5151348</prev>\n<first>5117956</first>\n<last>25804067</last>\n<when>1136727233</when>\n<utime>01/08/06 03:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
