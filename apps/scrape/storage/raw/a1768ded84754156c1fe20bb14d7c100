My bitch is that when people move to edibles/medicinals they have to un-learn all their bad habits, essentially starting the learning curve all over again.  With cubes, they'll fruit on just about anything, regardless of how you prepare the substrate, so they're like learning to ride a bike with training wheels.  However, if you don't learn to ride without those training wheels, you'll look awfully silly someday when you grow up and have to bolt them on your harley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why I suggest pasteurization of bulk substrates and casing material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this has all been covered before, so do a few searches and you'll find all you ever wanted to know from both sides of this coin.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6544922</next>\n<prev>6543805</prev>\n<first>6543765</first>\n<last>6545999</last>\n<when>1170968430</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 11:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
