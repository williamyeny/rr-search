The rings from the jar lids can be spread out on the bottom too. You can even put a layer of empty jars on top of the lids to hold your substrate jars completely above the water level.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A PC should never run low on water in a 90 minute cycle.  Be sure to turn down your stove to the minimum setting that will maintain pressure once you reach 15 psi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6177984</next>\n<prev>6177605</prev>\n<first>6176842</first>\n<last>6179088</last>\n<when>1161092847</when>\n<utime>10/17/06 04:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
