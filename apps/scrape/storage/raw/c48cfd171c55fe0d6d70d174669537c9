It won't hurt any pins or mushrooms that are growing.&amp;nbsp; Another thing you can do is pour water right on top of the cake so it pools up.&amp;nbsp; It should soak in within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're using a plastic grid, you can probably skip the foil unless it's helping prevent the fruits from growing downward.&amp;nbsp; Don't worry if the mushrooms form on the bottom of the cakes.&amp;nbsp; Often that's due to moisture content, but sometimes it's just strain related.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19980832</next>\n<prev>19980544</prev>\n<first>19979123</first>\n<last>19988087</last>\n<when>1399994701</when>\n<utime>05/13/14 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
