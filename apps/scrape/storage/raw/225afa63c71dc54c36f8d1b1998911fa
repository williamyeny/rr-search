You certainly have to provide for air exchange, but that's easily done with holes or slits in the sides.  I run my coolmist sitting on a shelf inside the greenhouse, and the water within last two weeks before it needs to be refilled.  Run for no more than two minutes, then off for ten to twenty.  This will give 85% to 90% humidity, which is perfect for cased substrates, and there will be no dripping.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5452599</next>\n<prev>5452534</prev>\n<first>5452423</first>\n<last>5471357</last>\n<when>1143597581</when>\n<utime>03/29/06 03:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
