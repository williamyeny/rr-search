It exchanges sterilization for peroxide treatment.  It's Ok for the lazy, but for those who look at the hobby as an art form, they'll take it to that level.  His peroxide teks are mostly for wood decomposers anyway, and he avoids steriliztion by not using suppliments such as rice or wheat bran, which greatly reduces yields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, you have reduced yields when it does work, and total failure most of the time when it doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6390800</prev>\n<first>6390776</first>\n<last>6390996</last>\n<when>1166656082</when>\n<utime>12/21/06 01:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
