Don't let the caps flatten all the way out because that wastes your spores and makes a mess all over your grow chamber. If they're for eating, pick just prior to veil tear for best overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that paper is a poor printing medium.  Its porous surface attracts and holds contaminants, and the lime and acids used in production gives paper a wildly varied pH, which doesn't do much for the spores longevity.  I use foil.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7490683</next>\n<prev>7490632</prev>\n<first>7490387</first>\n<last>22466563</last>\n<when>1191678101</when>\n<utime>10/06/07 04:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
