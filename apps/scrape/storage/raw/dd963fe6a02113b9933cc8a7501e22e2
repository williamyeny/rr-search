{"key":"post-5648408","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5648408</id>\n<content>I think those all are magnets, so make sure you have a commercial stirrer that has the spinning metal in the base.  I've seen some teks on here for home made stirrers built the opposite way where they spin a magnet and use a coated nail or some such as a stir bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stirrer has no magnet in the base, the only magnet is the stirbar.  I'm not sure that's a critical distinction, but it seems as though it would be.  Two magnets might cause too much friction and motor loads.  Something to look into anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5648447</next>\n<prev>5648370</prev>\n<first>5648332</first>\n<last>5648807</last>\n<when>1148016113</when>\n<utime>05/19/06 08:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
