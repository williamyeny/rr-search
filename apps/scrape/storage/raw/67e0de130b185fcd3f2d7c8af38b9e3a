I think it's a mistake to let jars sit after sterilization unless you never plan to use them.  The sterilization process gives you a three to four week window of opportunity to get the grains colonized.  To 'completely' sterilize a jar of rye would take 24 hours in the PC and would turn the grains to mush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the endospores are bacterial.  Mold spores are killed by fairly low temps, so if your contamination problem is green, then it's being introduced after sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5489446</next>\n<prev>5486038</prev>\n<first>5486038</first>\n<last>5489446</last>\n<when>1144387082</when>\n<utime>04/07/06 08:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
