Dont cover and dont let the vermiculite get wet or contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added protection, the holes can be covered with medical micropore tape, which is breathable.&amp;nbsp; You put the medical tape on before sterilization, and it keeps the top layer of verm sterile until you punch the needle through.&amp;nbsp; Simply inject right through the micropore tape, and leave the hole open afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably already know this, but you must also remove the foil.&amp;nbsp; Leaving the foil in place during colonization will lead to a higher rate of contamination, as well as stalling from lack of gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13975237</next>\n<prev>13974406</prev>\n<first>13969945</first>\n<last>13978856</last>\n<when>1297900359</when>\n<utime>02/17/11 01:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
