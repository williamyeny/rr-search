I tagged someone just last week. They're not awarded for parroting advice, but if someone posts pictures and describes how they did it, and shows by repeated grows that he/she's to be trusted with sound advice, they'll get the tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the tag on HC because she has awesome grows, while doing just about everything differently than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is off topic.&amp;nbsp; If it doesn't die a natural death, I'll have to lock it later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12081443</next>\n<prev>12079017</prev>\n<first>12074711</first>\n<last>12084053</last>\n<when>1266893237</when>\n<utime>02/23/10 04:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
