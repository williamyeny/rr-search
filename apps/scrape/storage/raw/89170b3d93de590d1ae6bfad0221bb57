{"key":"post-6784616","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6784616</id>\n<content>You need to forget that long-winded writeup based on what somebody did in 1977, when we were just getting started growing indoors and learning the ropes.  There's far more modern and accurate information right here to be had.    I'd suggest starting at the top of this page in the FAQ and doing some reading.  An alternative is to simply read back a hundred or two pages in this forum, by reading all the posts on each page, then clicking the link at the bottom right to the next page, and going through them from there.  Good luck and welcome to the group.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6785422</next>\n<prev>6784610</prev>\n<first>6784515</first>\n<last>6785422</last>\n<when>1176516278</when>\n<utime>04/14/07 05:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
