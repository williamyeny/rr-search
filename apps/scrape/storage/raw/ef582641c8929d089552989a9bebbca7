{"key":"post-6768420","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6768420</id>\n<content>Probably little to no yield at all.  Pf cakes already have enough verm in them, so you don't spawn them to more, since vermiculite has no nutrients or food for the mycelium. If you want to do a bulk grow, spawn your 16 jars to three or four times that amount of horse manure, or ten times that amount of straw.  You don't use a bottom layer.  If you choose to case the bulk substrate, peat/verm works well, but not verm by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perlite is for humidifying a terrarium, not for mixing your spawn into.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6768435</next>\n<prev>6768202</prev>\n<first>6768202</first>\n<last>6768440</last>\n<when>1176189683</when>\n<utime>04/10/07 10:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
