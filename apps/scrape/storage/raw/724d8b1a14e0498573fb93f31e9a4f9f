It's superior to cow manure and nearly as good as horse.  In fact, lots of growers use coir to fluff up their manure or other compost.  I do not recommend using coir in a casing layer, although many growers do.  In my opinion, the best casing mixture is peat/verm.   I'll bet that coir compost would make an excellent substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5478305</prev>\n<first>5478082</first>\n<last>5478339</last>\n<when>1144161481</when>\n<utime>04/04/06 05:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
