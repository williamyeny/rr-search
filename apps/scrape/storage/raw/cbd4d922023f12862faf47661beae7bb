If your friend is reporting no gas exchange, he's either lying or the jars are not sealed as he thinks they are.&amp;nbsp; Back in the day, we would use the lids upside down with no holes and no filter at all, and enough gas exchange would &lt;i&gt;usually&lt;/i&gt; occur around the imperfect seal on the lid, provided we didn't screw the ring down tight.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium requires air for its metabolic processes, and generates CO2 as a byproduct.&amp;nbsp; Too little air, or too much CO2 and the mycelium shits the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the jars that stalled, we could loosen the lid ring and the mycelium would take back off again.&amp;nbsp; Of course, we also had about a 20% contamination rate, simply because we hadn't developed PTFE or tyvek filters yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major causes of stalling grain jars with our new members here is lack of gas exchange.&amp;nbsp; It's been proved so many thousands of times it's beyond debate.&amp;nbsp; I've even lost a few master culture slants due to making too many wraps of parafilm around the loose lid.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11114973</prev>\n<first>11114612</first>\n<last>11115363</last>\n<when>1253760094</when>\n<utime>09/24/09 05:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
