The problem with humidstats is they get clogged up with spores after just a few releases.  If you always harvest as or just before the veil tears, it won't be a problem.  If you like to let spores dump all over the place, your humidstat won't last but a few weeks.  That's why most of us have switched back to timers.  With a bit of dialing in, then tweaking as the seasons change, you can regulate humidty pretty well with a good cycle timer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6447832</prev>\n<first>6447799</first>\n<last>6448050</last>\n<when>1168530751</when>\n<utime>01/11/07 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
