It's the same principle that makes your ears hurt when you dive too deep in a pool or lake.  If a large pot won't fit in your refrigerator, simply change the water every 8 hours or so, giving a short rinse between each batch of water.  The refrigerator just helps to prevent bacteria growth during the dunk, but replacing the water a few times does the same thing.  I put the cakes in a large kettle and then place a heavy glass dinner plate over them, that pushes them deep down in the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6909234</prev>\n<first>6908214</first>\n<last>6909782</last>\n<when>1179081884</when>\n<utime>05/13/07 09:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
