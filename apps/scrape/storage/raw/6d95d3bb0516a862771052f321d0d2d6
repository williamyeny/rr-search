{"key":"post-5930086","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5930086</id>\n<content>No, you don't want to sterilize casing mix.  You want to pasteurize it.  PH is extremely important in a casing mix.  The mushroom mycelium doesn't care, and we don't lime our casing mixes for the mushrooms.  Mushrooms will fruit just fine at a ph of 5.5, but that is also the favorite PH for molds such as trichoderma.  The reason we lime our casing mixes at the start to a PH of 7.5 to 8 is because the mushroom mycelium can tolerate the higher PH, but mold spores have a hard time germinating at anything above 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As suggested above, I'd test the PH.  Most houseplants prefer a PH of 6.5, so that's probably the level it's adjusted to.  You'll want to add a bit more lime, and also some gypsum for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5930123</next>\n<prev>5929915</prev>\n<first>5923766</first>\n<last>5930153</last>\n<when>1154669083</when>\n<utime>08/04/06 08:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
