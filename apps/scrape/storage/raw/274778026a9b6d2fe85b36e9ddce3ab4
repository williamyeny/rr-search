Easily as good as oust and much cheaper.  I measured a 99% drop in airborn particulates after a bleach bomb.  Oust isn't as effective, since it only attacks bacteria spores.  Bleach attacks bacteria as well as mold spores, then carries them harmlessly to the floor as the mist settles.  The problem is bleach ruins your clothes, carpet, bedding, nose and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5739249</prev>\n<first>5738194</first>\n<last>5742517</last>\n<when>1150151855</when>\n<utime>06/13/06 01:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
