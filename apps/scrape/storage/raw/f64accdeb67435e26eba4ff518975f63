Do sterile work in STILL air, not moving air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitchens are the worst possible place to work.  There is more fecal bacteria floating around a kitchen than in the bathroom right after you take a dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've noticed the new growers that are saying it's ok to be nasty are also buying syringes from vendors so have their sterile lab work already done by someone else.  That isn't mycology folks.  When you learn to harvest a crop, take prints, germinate spores on agar, isolate strains, and produce a killer fruiting strain that blows you away with its potency, you'll understand what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lab work isn't supposed to be clean.  It's supposed to be &lt;i&gt;laboratory sterile.&lt;/i&gt;  No cut corners.  When it comes to spawning a bulk substrate, who gives a shit if you pick your nose while working?  It doesn't matter.  If the grains were properly prepared and colonized in sterile conditions to full colonization, you can spawn to bulk outdoors if you want to.  When you go to the Stamets seminars, you'll see Paul build a straw log or other project outside in the open air and it works fine.  However, you can bet your ass the spawn wasn't produced outdoors in the open air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn to be sterile where sterility is called for, and be clean where being clean is called for and you'll be fine.   I live in a 40 year old condo building in a very damp climate and my entire building is infested with black mold, and it has wall to wall carpeting.  It's unhealthy for us and we're trying to sell the damn thing so we can move, but every project I've done has been done in this mold infested place, yet I can grow successfully by following the advice given above, and even filmed my video DVD here, doing lab work and growing a dozen or more species from spores to the fruiting/harvest stage.  Several of my terrariums sit within 18&quot; of a wall that has black mold growing on it, yet it NEVER grows on my cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sterile work, surgical gloves are a must, surgical mask is a must(dust masks are for carpenters, not surgeons), a still air glovebox or laminar flow hood is a must, A closed, draft free room is a must especially if you're using a flowhood, and spray the air with oust at least two or three times before starting the flowhood.  I let the flowhood run for at least an hour in that closed and oust sprayed room before beginning work, which gives me time to shower, wash my hair and brush my teeth, use mouthwash, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once your spawn jars are fully colonized, you can scratch your butt while you inoculate the coir if you want.  Bacteria isn't a contaminant of bulk substrates.  The important thing is to learn when it's important to be sterile.  If someone else is doing your sterile work for you, then don't brag about how dirty you can be and get away with it.  Anybody can be dirty and get away with it under those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6789983</next>\n<prev>6789956</prev>\n<first>6788857</first>\n<last>6797723</last>\n<when>1176653226</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
