{"key":"post-7466717","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7466717</id>\n<content>For a couple of weeks, simply leave the jar at room temperature.  I regularly store jars on a shelf for a month after full colonization if I'm  too busy to use them, and there is no degeneration at all.  I recommend against incubators unless your house is very cold, and in addition, there is absolutely no reason to keep colonizing jars in the dark.  Normal room light has no effect on colonizing mycelium, either good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7466490</prev>\n<first>7465235</first>\n<last>7466717</last>\n<when>1191078773</when>\n<utime>09/29/07 06:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
