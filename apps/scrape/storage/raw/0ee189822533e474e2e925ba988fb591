I wanted as much as I could get on the video in the four hours I had available, and the ten minutes I explained how to use coffee without screwing up the grow, meant something else like agar work or sawdust/woodchips had to go.  Coffee definitely is a boost to grain spawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cost, it's the cheapest on the market.  Fmrc's 80 minute vhs video is $85, and the only other one is that lame 'mushroom growing made easy' that's got bootleg versions on Youtube, and it's $36 for an hour and ten minutes to get a legal copy.  Mine is $39 for four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the music.  I have over 50 DVD's of music that I've paid royalties on.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7001648</next>\n<prev>7001312</prev>\n<first>7000595</first>\n<last>25059477</last>\n<when>1180844423</when>\n<utime>06/03/07 07:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
