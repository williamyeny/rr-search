I germinate, colonize, and fruit all at normal room temperature of 72-75.  You'll be much better off avoiding wild temprature fluctuations as well.  They'll cause condensation to form in your jars, possibly leading to failure due to excess moisture around the edges where they're exposed to the wild fluctuations. That can contribute to bacterial growth, as will higher temps.  Room temperature is best, imo.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4263110</next>\n<prev>4263071</prev>\n<first>4263061</first>\n<last>4264403</last>\n<when>1118074914</when>\n<utime>06/06/05 07:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
