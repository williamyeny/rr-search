In fact, I have two slits in my greenhouse that go from floor to ceiling.  This provides constant air exchange.  The humidifir inside runs one minute on, six minutes off to give 90%.  I can leave it unattended for days at a time and everything regulates perfectly.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5704797</prev>\n<first>5703081</first>\n<last>5704907</last>\n<when>1149292020</when>\n<utime>06/03/06 02:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
