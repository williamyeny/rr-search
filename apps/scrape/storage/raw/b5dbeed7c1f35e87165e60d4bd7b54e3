{"key":"post-6981150","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6981150</id>\n<content>Set the box on an upper shelf.  It's always several degrees warmer near the ceiling than on the floor.  I'd avoid heaters if at all possible.  I colonize jars on an open shelf winter and summer.  It matters little if it takes a few days longer to colonize, because if you start a batch of jars every weekend, within a few weeks, you'll have a harvest every weekend, and contaminants will be much less frequent if you colonize at a lower temp.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6981196</next>\n<prev>6981112</prev>\n<first>6979630</first>\n<last>7150128</last>\n<when>1180450432</when>\n<utime>05/29/07 05:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
