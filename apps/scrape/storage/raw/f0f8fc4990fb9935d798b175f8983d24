I remember reading a post a few weeks back about someone's syringe being sucked dry when they went to inoculate a jar that had pressure built up inside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you meant to say vacuum.&amp;nbsp; You need holes drilled into your lids and a filter over them to prevent contaminants entering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no gas exchange holes in the lid, and you tighten the lids down, your jars will explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do you say that?&amp;nbsp;  I do it all the time when sterilizing water.&amp;nbsp; If you're operating your PC correctly, the pressure inside the jars will be the same as the pressure in the PC, thus no differential.&amp;nbsp; The only way the jars would explode is if the grower did something dumb like letting pressure out of the PC rapidly, which is never advised for other reasons as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9804589</next>\n<prev>9804520</prev>\n<first>9804447</first>\n<last>9804883</last>\n<when>1234755918</when>\n<utime>02/16/09 05:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
