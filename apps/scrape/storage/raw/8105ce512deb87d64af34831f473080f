Your cakes might have been contaminated with bacteria, or they might just be slow to pin, or if multispore inoculation, there's always the slight chance of a non fruiting strain.  I'd dunk again overnight and put them back in.  Make sure you're not setting the cakes directly on the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fanning is good, even with all the holes.  The holes also tend to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; humidity rather than the other way around by drawing air up from below the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7256719</next>\n<prev>7256484</prev>\n<first>7255924</first>\n<last>24777265</last>\n<when>1186186624</when>\n<utime>08/04/07 03:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
