Use it on top only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compost and casing materials should be pasteurized in order to preserve the beneficial bacteria in the peat or compost/manure.  They keep the compost or casing material 'alive' and therefore more resistant to molds.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently proved this to myself once again.  I was cooking up a load of rye, but had one tray that needed patching. I was out of pasteurized 50/50, so I mixed some up and put it in a quart jar and pc'd it along with the other nine quarts of rye.  Ten days later, I'm fighting cobweb mold in only one tray out of many, and it's &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; tray.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5683512</next>\n<prev>5683336</prev>\n<first>5683078</first>\n<last>5684075</last>\n<when>1148846138</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 10:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
