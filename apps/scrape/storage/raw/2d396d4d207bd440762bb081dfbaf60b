The problem with that idea however is we don't heat fruiting chambers.  If you try to heat one, your humidity will be stolen by the walls of your tub to make condensation with.  You want to heat the room the fruiting chamber is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a coolmist is great for a mini-greenhouse, but for tubs, the easiest and in my experience best solution is to use three to four inches of damp perlite in the bottom of the tote.  This will deliver 95%+ humidity for at least two months.  I drill anywhere from ten to fifty holes around the edges of the rubbermaid tote for air exchange, depending on the size.  Make one row of holes at or just below the level of the perlite. Make a second row of holes just below the lid, unless you have a tote with a loose fitting lid, which is ideal. I also make a few small holes in the very bottom of the tote to allow any CO2 gasses that might be building up in the perlite itself to escape.  They also let any excess moisture drain, as you want your perlite damp, but not wet and certainly no standing water in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with growing and welcome to the shroomery.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6490253</next>\n<prev>6489294</prev>\n<first>6489294</first>\n<last>6493455</last>\n<when>1169583206</when>\n<utime>01/23/07 10:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
