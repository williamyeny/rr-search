Its not opinion, its fact... look it up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.  PF cakes have a much higher BE than grains.  Look it up.  Don't be so quick to judge.   I use grains 99% of the time, but that doesn't mean BRF is inferior, and neither one causes the mushrooms to be more or less potent.  To claim otherwise is the same as claiming a certain food can turn pee-wee herman into arnold, or a retard into an Einstein.  Such is not supported by the facts.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6786909</next>\n<prev>6786795</prev>\n<first>6786274</first>\n<last>6788772</last>\n<when>1176574803</when>\n<utime>04/14/07 09:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
