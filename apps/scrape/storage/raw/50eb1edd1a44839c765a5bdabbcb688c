If you're using brf with a verm barrier, you should have drilled the holes before sterilization, and then covered the top with foil during the process.  You also should have had them elevated out of the water.  The steam will sterilize them.  What you heard was air rushing INto the jars.  A vacuum was created when the jars cooled.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6900126</next>\n<prev>6900085</prev>\n<first>6899898</first>\n<last>6901960</last>\n<when>1178860890</when>\n<utime>05/11/07 08:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
