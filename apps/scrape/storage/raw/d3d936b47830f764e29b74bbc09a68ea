{"key":"post-7412939","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7412939</id>\n<content>I've never noticed any difference in cultivation requirements for various strains within a species group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put a strain thread at the top of the page to prevent the repetitive and incorrect recycling of 'strain information' in several threads at once.  One guy might think the Tex strain produces lots of small mushrooms because that's what he got.  However, the next guy who got spores from the same supplier might think the Tex strain grows a few huge fruits, because that's what he got.  That's the nature of multispore inoculation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all and please keep it nice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7412992</next>\n<prev>7412874</prev>\n<first>7412361</first>\n<last>7413035</last>\n<when>1189878917</when>\n<utime>09/15/07 08:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
