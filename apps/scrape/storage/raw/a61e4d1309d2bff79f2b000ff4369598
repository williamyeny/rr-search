{"key":"post-6910462","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6910462</id>\n<content>I explained what was wrong in my last post.  I hate to answer by saying, &quot;order my DVD next week&quot;, but I have a whole section on agar, and I'm sure you can benefit from seeing the work done hands on.  Turning dishes upside down is a horrible idea.  The moisture will fall from gravity from the agar and collect on the lid, and then spill back down when you turn it over, ruining everything.  Condensation is caused by pouring the dishes while still too hot.  You want to let the agar cool in the filtered flask until you can pour the petri dishes without heat protection for your hands.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6911958</next>\n<prev>6909651</prev>\n<first>6901965</first>\n<last>6914551</last>\n<when>1179096272</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 01:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
