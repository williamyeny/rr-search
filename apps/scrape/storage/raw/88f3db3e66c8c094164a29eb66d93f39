{"key":"post-7130060","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7130060</id>\n<content>After you shake the jars to loosen the seeds up, make sure it smells like fresh mushrooms before you use it.  If it smells like dirt it's likely mold, and if it smells sweet, sour, or like venegar, it's  bacteria.  A fresh mushroom smell is what you want.  If it is, you're good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest not filling the jars quite so full next time.  It's easier to shake when they're 2/3 to 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7150460</next>\n<prev>7129832</prev>\n<first>7129602</first>\n<last>7150460</last>\n<when>1183607351</when>\n<utime>07/05/07 06:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
