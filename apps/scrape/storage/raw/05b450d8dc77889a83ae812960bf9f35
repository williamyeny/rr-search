It sounds like it's not a rye problem at all.  Mods can delete this if it's against the rules to say, but ET has ripped off many people, so it's actually very likely you did get bunk spores.  If your rye came labeled 'organic' it doesn't have any fungicides in it.  If you used various amounts of solution, at least some of them should have worked.  If there's no contamination in the grains, that says you sterilized ok.  All arrows point to the syringes now.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3876395</next>\n<prev>3875423</prev>\n<first>3856762</first>\n<last>3881704</last>\n<when>1110099064</when>\n<utime>03/06/05 10:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
