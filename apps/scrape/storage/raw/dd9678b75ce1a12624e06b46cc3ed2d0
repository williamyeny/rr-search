A commercial quality 3CCD digital video camera is $10,000, and it takes at least two to make a quality instructional video.  I have $4,000 in a new computer to get the graphics and editing speed I needed, plus over $5,000 in software to do layovers and special effects.  Add in the commercial lighting, the green board room, and of course all the spawn, agar, bulk substrates, grains, etc., and you get a picture of the expense involved.  Then of course the hundreds of hours filming and editing, and it all has to be done on the mycelium's time schedule, not ones own.  It's a pain in the ass.  I'll be seriously pissed when I release my DVD's if I find them posted online.  I will definitely take legal action against any website that I catch hosting them.  It should be no different with the videos this guy made.  That's why the admins and mods have been locking down these threads, and rightly so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5113554</prev>\n<first>5112095</first>\n<last>5113885</last>\n<when>1135756305</when>\n<utime>12/28/05 09:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
