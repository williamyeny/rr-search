I dumped them outside then filled the jars w/ bleach. Few days later I hosed them out (they were still outside)&lt;br /&gt;Then I PC'd them for an hr and a half.&lt;br /&gt;After a few dishwasher cycles....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the jars are empty, simply wash with soap and water before re-loading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good idea to either PC before opening or open contaminated jars outdoors to dump out.  Remember though, if you open a contaminated jar oudoors, thousands, if not millions of contaminant spores could land on your clothes and body, and then you'll bring them back into your house with you.  Some growers open the jars under water slowly so that the water can keep the spores out of the air.  Other growers don't feel the cost of the jar is worth dealing with the contams, so simply trash the jars without opening.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8448910</prev>\n<first>8447924</first>\n<last>8449190</last>\n<when>1211867952</when>\n<utime>05/27/08 08:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
