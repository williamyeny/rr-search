I use my left over coffee from breakfast, mixed 50/50 with tap water to hydrate both rye berries and rye grass seed. Don't forget to put a pinch of gypsum in each jar.  Put a solid, non filtered lid on the jar and shake it up well.  Allow to sit overnight, then replace with a filtered lid and pressure cook for an hour at 15 PSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I've had much better success with sclerotia forming species by using rye berries, rather than rye grass seed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6227470</next>\n<prev>6227252</prev>\n<first>6227012</first>\n<last>6230134</last>\n<when>1162250087</when>\n<utime>10/31/06 01:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
