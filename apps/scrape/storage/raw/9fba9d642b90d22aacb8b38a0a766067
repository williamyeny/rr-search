They're a tad more picky on what they grow on, but pasteurized, cased horse manure works great.  Keep the casing layer thin, perhaps 1/4&quot; or less.  Give them an extra week to ten days longer than cubes to pin, and try to keep the temp up to around 80 or so during fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5775697</next>\n<prev>5774775</prev>\n<first>5773853</first>\n<last>5775910</last>\n<when>1150889217</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 02:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
