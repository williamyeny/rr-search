I can think of no reason to use flammable substances in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flames are not compatible with the inside of a glovebox.  First, water is a byproduct of combustion so they fog up the inside, making it hard to see your work.  Second, flames burn oxygen.  This O2 has to be replaced, thus air currents are drawn into your previously still air glovebox.  Third, the flame creates wind by convection lifting the air, thus creating turbulence.  The combination of air being drawn in, then stirred up is the exact opposite of what you are trying to accomplish with a glovebox, which is still, but &lt;i&gt;not sterile&lt;/i&gt; air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the flame on the outside.  I recommend flaming an inoculation needle between each jar. Wiping with alcohol sanitizes the outside of the needle, but does nothing for what was drawn inside the needle in the previous possibly contaminated jar. This eliminates any chance of cross contamination between jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need attached gloves in a mycology glovebox.  Those are used in biological applications to protect the user from what's inside.  In mycology, we use a glovebox to protect what's inside from us and from air currents in the room which are heavily laden with our bad breath, bacteria from our armpits, dogs and cats, cooking, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll cut a couple of arm holes in the side of a rubbermaid, you can bring your arm out to flame your needle or scalpel, then return it to the glovebox while still red hot.  Once your arm is back in the opening(sized to be tight against your arm) the turbulent air currents will stop, and you can then wipe the jar top with alcohol, and insert your now slightly cooled needle right through.   Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6609772</next>\n<prev>6609718</prev>\n<first>6609600</first>\n<last>6609820</last>\n<when>1172453417</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 03:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
