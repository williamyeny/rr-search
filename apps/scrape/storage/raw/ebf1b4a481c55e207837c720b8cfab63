I also started with bulk because the pf tek hadn't been invented yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you can do a batch of pf cakes for the price of a dozen jars and a bag of brown rice, and a $3 bag of vermiculite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulk requires a bit more investment, such as a pressure cooker and larger jars for grain, but the rewards are much greater, to be sure.  For someone who might not like the experience, pf tek the first time prevents them from going bankrupt.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7570193</next>\n<prev>7564867</prev>\n<first>7559934</first>\n<last>7570385</last>\n<when>1193459589</when>\n<utime>10/27/07 07:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
