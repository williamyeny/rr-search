Put it together a tad on the dry side and you'll actually get faster colonization.  You can go a bit less than field capacity.  My method of determining field capacity is to pick up a handful of the moistened manure or casing mix and make sure no water drips out.  If even one drop falls, it's too wet.  Give a gentle squeeze about like a firm handshake, and a couple of drops will fall, but no more.  Give a hard squeeze like you were trying to strangle the stuff, and a small stream flows for a second or two.  Any wetter than that is too wet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6283324</next>\n<prev>6283211</prev>\n<first>6242258</first>\n<last>6283324</last>\n<when>1163549041</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 02:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
