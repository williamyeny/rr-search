I routinely go through 40 to 100 dishes on a single strain isolation series, and you need them all at the same time, so glass gets awfully expensive.  In additon, they're heavy and slippery when wet with alcohol soaked gloves, and they break when dropped.  I'd suggest getting a box of disposable petri dishes in pre sterilized sleeves of 20 dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer your question, glass petris are autoclavable, but you better have a sterile room for the PC to cool in or they'll just get contaminated when the PC cools or when you open it to remove them.  You should get a rack to set them in to PC.  Don't use towels.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6846256</next>\n<prev>6843467</prev>\n<first>6843467</first>\n<last>6847584</last>\n<when>1177767490</when>\n<utime>04/28/07 04:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
