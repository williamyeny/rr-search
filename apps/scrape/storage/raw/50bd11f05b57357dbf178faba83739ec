They're intended for living rooms with mid-range humidity and all they'll read in your terrarium is 8888 or ----- or -HIGH-, etc.  You can get a mechanical one for ten bucks at a cigar shop that can be calibrated.  However, I never use them with perlite in a terrarium.  Just use two to three inches of damp, but not wet perlite and you'll have 98% to 99% humidity.  No need for a hygrometer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6194011</next>\n<prev>6193715</prev>\n<first>6193648</first>\n<last>6194011</last>\n<when>1161444326</when>\n<utime>10/21/06 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
