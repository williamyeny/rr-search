Gently twist and pull at the base of ready mushrooms and leave on table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should cut the mushrooms off at the base.&amp;nbsp; Usually, twist and pull leaves divots in the substrate which are prime breeding grounds for mold spores to germinate, ruining the whole substrate.&amp;nbsp; If it can be done without ripping out substrate it's fine, but most of the time that isn't the case, thus it's best to use a very sharp knife or razor to cut the mushrooms off at the base.&amp;nbsp; Some growers even use thread or fishing line to wrap around the base and then pull the ends to cut off the mushroom stem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16443850</next>\n<prev>16419070</prev>\n<first>16418518</first>\n<last>16443850</last>\n<when>1340378037</when>\n<utime>06/22/12 06:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
