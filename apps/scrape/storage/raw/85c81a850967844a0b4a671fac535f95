{"key":"post-11670325","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>11670325</id>\n<content>I've read the study and looked at the pictures.&amp;nbsp; It's obvious these are noobs on their first grow, regardless of the fact they have access to a GC. I would bet money they're using multispore inoculation by the looks of the pictures.&amp;nbsp; I would also bet money they don't know how to adjust pinning triggers, by the looks of the crappy harvests they got.&amp;nbsp; Nor do they know what a casing layer is.&amp;nbsp; They also didn't quantify the light source or frequency used, only making high-schoolish references to dim, medium, bright, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the pictures of fruits grown in poor light conditions also show signs of insufficient fresh air exchange, which could be skewing any results obtained.&amp;nbsp; It seems in their vigor to block light, they also blocked fresh air.&amp;nbsp; Based on the pictures, they only had a few fruits to work with, and as everyone here has found out by experience, there can be an exponential difference in potency between individual mushrooms on the same flush.&amp;nbsp; It takes a LOT of mushrooms to establish any sort of factual data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these results contradict the experience of thousands of members here over the last decade and earlier, I'm going to dismiss this as a fluke.&amp;nbsp; How many times a week do we get noobs here saying things such as &quot;this-or-that strain are fast colonizers, slow colonizers, more potent, less potent, more contam resistant, etc&quot;., all based on one or two grows, when they haven't even learned the variables yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, chemistry geeks are going to have a field day with their extraction technique, which involves heating the dried fruits, completely fucking up the psilocin which is what they were trying to measure.&amp;nbsp; They didn't even measure psilocybin, the main ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11670360</next>\n<prev>11670251</prev>\n<first>11666108</first>\n<last>11677542</last>\n<when>1261097047</when>\n<utime>12/18/09 02:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
