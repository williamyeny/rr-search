I'd give them very little chance of success.  I'd suggest making up a fresh batch.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to elevate the jars completely out of the water when you steam them.  Put whatever you have in the bottom of the pot when you boil to raise the jars up. Anything from rocks, to a metal shelf, to a row or two of extra lid rings from jars will work.  Get where the water isn't even touching your jars, and cover the tops with foil to prevent the water that drips down from the lid from entering through the vent/inoculation holes.   Good luck to you and welcome to the boards.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6804534</next>\n<prev>6804264</prev>\n<first>6804062</first>\n<last>6806709</last>\n<when>1176922396</when>\n<utime>04/18/07 09:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
