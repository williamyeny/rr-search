I just said to let it set for 2 hours before going to the next step.&amp;nbsp; Now you know the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another question asked a lot is do you need to rinse the soap out.&amp;nbsp; No, you don't.&amp;nbsp; Simply lift the soapy straw, let it drain back into the soak tub, and then transfer to your pasteurization water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I grow commercially, I soak in a much larger barrel overnight, so have no need for soap.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17203986</next>\n<prev>17202176</prev>\n<first>17201817</first>\n<last>17208434</last>\n<when>1352691053</when>\n<utime>11/12/12 05:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
