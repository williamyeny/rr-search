Temps are still fluctuating &amp; I still need to fire up the wood stove for warmth in my utility room which would further suck up what little humidity there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've just described my climate.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it was 10F on Easter Sunday morning, and it's 20F outside right now.&amp;nbsp; We run our wood stove through June.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shotgun terrarium will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;mojoraisin said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another question: the SG requires constant spraying (up to 4x daily). The original PF Tek says don't spray directly onto cakes. What is the best way to indirect spray?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All developing mushrooms should be sprayed.&amp;nbsp; When pf wrote that tek, he had no previous mushroom growing experience.&amp;nbsp; He built a terrarium out of a fish tank which was totally sealed up, and if you mist mushrooms without providing fresh air, bacteria blooms and they rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to provide lots of fresh air which is the number one pinning trigger, and then mist to make up for what evaporates.&amp;nbsp; This understanding is why the pictures of first time grows today blow away the pictures of first time grows from ten to fifteen years ago.&amp;nbsp; Spray when you can.&amp;nbsp; I often work all day and don't touch my terrariums except early morning and evening, and then a spray just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16084131</next>\n<prev>16082946</prev>\n<first>16057877</first>\n<last>16085762</last>\n<when>1334326067</when>\n<utime>04/13/12 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
