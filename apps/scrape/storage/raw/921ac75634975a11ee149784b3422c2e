Try eating 30 or 50 grams fresh and I bet you get spun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This.&amp;nbsp; Or as Terrence used to say, &quot;when in doubt, double the dose&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh is always better in part because the psilocin breaks down during drying.&amp;nbsp; By eating them fresh, you have psilocybin &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; psilocin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also advise to err on the side of eating too much rather than too little.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing worse than eating just enough to yawn and be lethargic without being able to sleep, but not enough to actually trip.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17640507</next>\n<prev>17640329</prev>\n<first>17633607</first>\n<last>17642405</last>\n<when>1359604127</when>\n<utime>01/31/13 05:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
