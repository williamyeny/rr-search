Bleach is totally ineffective against fungi mycelium.  I've dipped tissue to be cloned into 50/50 bleach-water and had the mycelium grow just fine.  What bleach will do if sprayed on trichoderma is to turn the green spores white, making one 'think' they've killed the mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, people with severe immune problems such as HIV/AIDS can actually have trichoderma spores germinate and grow inside their lungs, causing serious problems.  Again, it's the spores that are harmful, not the mold itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even oyster mushrooms can cause severe problems from spores.  In fact, I can no longer grow hypsizygus ulmarium because I had a bout of flu while a crop was fruiting, and I was too sick to harvest, so the spores filled my entire room, including my lungs.  I got so sick from those, that to this day, I can't be around that species anymore.  I start wheezing as soon as the spores fall.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6624096</prev>\n<first>6622513</first>\n<last>6624181</last>\n<when>1172774586</when>\n<utime>03/01/07 08:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
