You can clearly see it in the second picture, lower third, just to the left of the glare from the camera flash.  That milky/greasy growth is bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't fill jars more than 3/4 full at the most.   2/3 is better.  If you fill them up like yours, the filter material in the lid gets wet with grain juice and contaminants will colonize right through the filter and into the grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6308336</prev>\n<first>6307796</first>\n<last>6308498</last>\n<when>1164762485</when>\n<utime>11/29/06 03:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
