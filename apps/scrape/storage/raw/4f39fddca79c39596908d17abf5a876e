{"key":"post-6457809","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6457809</id>\n<content>Trich spores are always going to be present, and will be at much higher levels after a previous outbreak. The key is to prevent their germination and growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trichoderma, like cobweb and other molds, prefers still, stale air.  Prevention is mostly about &lt;i&gt;fresh air, and circulating, turbulent air.&lt;/i&gt;  Depending on your setup, you'll have to find ways to keep air moving in all the nooks and crannies in your tub and/or greenhouse.  It might be as simple as drilling a few holes in your tubs, or fanning more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trichoderma also loves sterilized media, so don't ever sterilize casing material.  Either leave it untreated, or pasteurize only. Pasteurize, never sterilize bulk substrates. Remember, it isn't about spores, because they're going to be there no matter what you do.  It's about making the environment unsuitable for the molds to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6458021</next>\n<prev>6457786</prev>\n<first>6457748</first>\n<last>6458498</last>\n<when>1168785497</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 04:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
