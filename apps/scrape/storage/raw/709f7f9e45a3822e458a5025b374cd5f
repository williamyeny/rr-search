The only difference is that I used pint jars, so I just trippled the amount of products to put into the substrate (same ratio and all that). Inoculated the jars, stuffed em in a box and now theyre waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two issues: 1, some of the jars got compacted by the pressure cooker, although this did not happen on the vids. I've searched and know its most likely my grade of verm. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn't see the BRF compact on the video because the correct size 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars were used.&amp;nbsp; I've posted hundreds of times that pint jars are not suitable.&amp;nbsp; Since you tripled the amount of product going into the pint jars and they're only double in size, that explains the tight packing.&amp;nbsp; I'd dump them out and start over with the correct size jars and the correct amount of substrate in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine verm is what is shown in the video and what is supposed to be used.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16025118</next>\n<prev>16024750</prev>\n<first>16023594</first>\n<last>16025199</last>\n<when>1333229184</when>\n<utime>04/01/12 12:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
