Also, normal room lighting has no effect on colonizing mycelium, either good or bad.  There is no reason to keep jars in the dark.  69F is a tad on the cool side and colonization speed will be lower.  75F is fine, so try to keep it up in that range.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7611088</next>\n<prev>7611061</prev>\n<first>7576714</first>\n<last>7611445</last>\n<when>1194551500</when>\n<utime>11/08/07 09:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
