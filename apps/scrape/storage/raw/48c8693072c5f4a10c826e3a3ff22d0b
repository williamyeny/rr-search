I can get 1/3 of a jar of sclerotia for each jar of grain.  With Mex a, it's about half a jar of sclerotia from a jar of grains.  I'd suggest forgetting about the bag for another month or two, and then break it up to get your stones out. You can always stick a few pieces of scerotia into a flower pot if you want some fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8002276</next>\n<prev>8000982</prev>\n<first>8000774</first>\n<last>8002276</last>\n<when>1202611117</when>\n<utime>02/10/08 04:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
