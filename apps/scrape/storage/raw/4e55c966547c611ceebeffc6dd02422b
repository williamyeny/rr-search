If you want to know why, search 'upside down' and my username for all the dozens of times I've explained it in detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, you should have wrapped your dishes with parafilm, not cheap saran wrap which doesn't breathe properly, despite what you might read around here.&amp;nbsp; In addition, once you've wrapped them with parafilm, they should be placed inside ziplock bags to stabilize the temperature.&amp;nbsp; Mini-refrigerators don't maintain a steady temperature, and everytime the temp changes, moisture is puked out of your agar.&amp;nbsp; Dishes and test tubes should always be insulated from these temp swings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place parafilm wrapped dishes and slants into individual ziplock bags which are inflated with air from the laminar flow hood, and then place these into insulated lunch boxes before placing in the fridge.&amp;nbsp; This results in zero condensation caused by temp fluctuation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13244204</next>\n<prev>13244142</prev>\n<first>13239083</first>\n<last>13244476</last>\n<when>1285430045</when>\n<utime>09/25/10 06:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
