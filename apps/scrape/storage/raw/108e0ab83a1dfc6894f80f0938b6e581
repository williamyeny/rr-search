{"key":"post-5652414","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5652414</id>\n<content>I also pisses me off to no end when folks totally unqualified on the subject spread disinformation on the boards.  The green molds that plague mushroom cultivation are &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARE NOT TOXIC TO HUMANS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  Spreading urban myths does nothing to advance our science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should toss out projects with green molds on them because you don't want them to puke spores all over your grow area and house, contaminating future projects.  However, picking the mushrooms off a casing layer or cake with a touch of mold does NOT make the mushroom toxic in any way.   The commercial mushroom farms never toss out the harvest when they have an outbreak of trichoderma, nor does the FDA expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you have a Penicillin allergy, toss out any cakes that have BLUE mold on them.  However, since I grew my very first mushroom crop back in 1972, I've only seen Penicillium mold three or four times, other than on agar.  It prefers bread and cheese over manure/grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who keep repeating the lie that molds will harm you, did you never even wonder what makes blue cheese salad dressing blue? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbluecheese.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbluecheese.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5652450</next>\n<prev>5651943</prev>\n<first>5651684</first>\n<last>5656597</last>\n<when>1148127405</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 03:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
