If your room is cold, heat the room, but 68F is fine.  Set the tub where the sun can come through a window for an hour or two a day and that will warm it up a bit during that time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6695570</next>\n<prev>6692591</prev>\n<first>6691478</first>\n<last>6695804</last>\n<when>1174454578</when>\n<utime>03/21/07 08:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
