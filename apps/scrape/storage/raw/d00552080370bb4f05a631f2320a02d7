The figure of 3.6VA means that at 3 volts, you'll have 1.2 amps available, but at 12 volts, it will only deliver between 1/4 and 1/3 amp, which at 12 volts, isn't much.  If you want a 12 volt power supply, I'd suggest an inexpensive automotive battery charger.  You can get a 2 amp battery charger for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll also want it on a timer or it will dry out your fruiting chamber. I wouldn't run it more than one minute per hour if you're using a terrarium type setup.  You can also get those small electronic/computer cooling fans in 120 volt configuration from Radio Shack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have as good a result by simply leaving the lid of your FC cracked so it doesn't seal tight.  This will give constant air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6060160</next>\n<prev>6060004</prev>\n<first>6060004</first>\n<last>6060250</last>\n<when>1158244545</when>\n<utime>09/14/06 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
