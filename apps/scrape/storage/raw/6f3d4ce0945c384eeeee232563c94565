Consider this your one and only warning.&amp;nbsp; Take that kind of talk to OTD or the anon forum, where you'll find plenty of support. In fact, there's whole forums and IRC chat channels out there made up of people I've banned from here where you'll feel right at home. At my age, any bug which crawls up my ass gets scratched right the hell back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;k00laid said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Doc_T said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RogerRabbit said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Admiral Ackbar said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some of the TCs are not that trusted, and just regurgitate shit that is not exactly true. There are a few TCs that should not be TCs already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such as?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tahoe is one example.
