{"key":"post-6745645","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6745645</id>\n<content>I've typed this a gazillion times already, but here it goes yet again.  The large kernel size, means a larger space between the kernels, thus more WASTED space in a jar. You can observe this by simply looking. The larger kernel size also means less total surface area within the jar, thus LESS mycelium is produced.  It's no secret that a quart of popcorn will colonize faster than a quart of rye, but it has only about 10% as much mycelium as the same sized jar of rye, therefore it's &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;MUCH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; slower than rye for producing &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;mycelium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, as agar pointed out above, there are far fewer inoculation points with popcorn, therefore it doesn't go nearly as far when used to spawn to bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that despite its higher contamination rate, it does work, but you could get the same results with rye or wbs by simply using 1/10th of a jar to inoculate a substrate rather than the whole jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once spawned, the larger kernels are more prone to drying out, which weakens the mycelium on them, then when re-hydrated, the mold spores that have landed get the advantage over the weakened mushroom mycelium, therefore the higher contamination rate also continues right through fruiting, with more trichoderma contamination later on down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if there's NOTHING else available, use popcorn as a last resort, but only while you look for something more suitable.  You're paying twice the price per pound of product to get ten percent of the mycelium, and that assumes that you have 100% success, which you won't. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6745698</next>\n<prev>6745397</prev>\n<first>6744613</first>\n<last>6764698</last>\n<when>1175702097</when>\n<utime>04/04/07 06:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
