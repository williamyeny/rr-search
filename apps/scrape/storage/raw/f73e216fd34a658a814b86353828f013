The casing isn't just to provide moisture to the substrate.  The other function of casing is to provide a micro-environment with lots of little air spaces that is conducive to fruiting.  I've found that after dunking and recasing, the new casing layer rarely colonizes at all, but the flush will be much better than if you leave the substrate uncased, or use the old casing from the previous flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5090492</next>\n<prev>5084159</prev>\n<first>5083148</first>\n<last>21400760</last>\n<when>1135078953</when>\n<utime>12/20/05 01:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
