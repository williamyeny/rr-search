Cubes fruit in florida, cuba, mexico and texas in the summertime, so think about it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've run several tests myself, and every single time, the substrate that was cold shocked for 24 hours pinned on average 48 or more hours later than identical substrates that were not cold shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many growers put a substrate in the refrigerator, and a few days later they have pins, so they naturally think the cold shock is what delivered the pinset.
