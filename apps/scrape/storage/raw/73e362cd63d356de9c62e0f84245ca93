Don't let them dry out completly between flushes, but it's best to let them sit for a few days after picking a flush before you dunk for the next flush.  This ensures they're ready to flush again, and you time the dunk to give them the moisture to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can dunk in the refrigerator if it's really hot in your area.  The only reason is to slow down bacteria growth while the cake is submerged.  If it's not practical to dunk in the refrigerator, change out the dunk water once or twice during the process.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6860135</next>\n<prev>6859896</prev>\n<first>6859880</first>\n<last>6860135</last>\n<when>1178072349</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
