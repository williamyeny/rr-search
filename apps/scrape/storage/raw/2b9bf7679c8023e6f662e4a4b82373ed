It won't be exact, but close enough for what we're doing.&amp;nbsp; For things like casing layer prep, manure prep, etc., you're going to squeeze the excess water out anyway(or add more) when you test for field capacity.&amp;nbsp; For the BRF Tek, the ratio is 2-1-1, whether you use cups, quarts, liters, or truckloads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume to weight measurements really only work with water, and I agree that the metric system makes things much easier.&amp;nbsp; I always have to chuckle at my fellow Americans who think the metric system is 'hard to figure out' but they have no problem counting money. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12818947</next>\n<prev>12818553</prev>\n<first>12817802</first>\n<last>12818947</last>\n<when>1277759005</when>\n<utime>06/29/10 12:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
