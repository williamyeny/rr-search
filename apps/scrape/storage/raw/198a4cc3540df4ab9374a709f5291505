It sounds from the description like either black pin mold or aspergillis.   Molds generally aren't dangerous unless you inhale the concentrated spores.  I'd suggest tossing out jar and all, but if you need to save the jar, PC for an hour first to kill the contents so you don't release all those spores into your house.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6133125</prev>\n<first>6133016</first>\n<last>6133426</last>\n<when>1160007444</when>\n<utime>10/05/06 03:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
