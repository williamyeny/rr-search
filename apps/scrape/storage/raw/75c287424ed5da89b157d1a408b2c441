{"key":"post-7086316","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7086316</id>\n<content>Molds are introduced due to working in an unsterile environment and/or with non-sterile tools. They can get into a jar through an improper filter, or if the filter material gets wet, they can colonize right through it. They are not caused by any other things such as moisture content.  Mold spores are in the air everywhere.  One must prevent them from landing on the substrate until full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pictures above, the mold is growing near the inoculation sites, so I suspect a non-sterile inoculation procedure, such as failure to flame sterilize the syringe needle, or a contaminated spore solution.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7086245</prev>\n<first>7067068</first>\n<last>7086316</last>\n<when>1182691711</when>\n<utime>06/24/07 04:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
