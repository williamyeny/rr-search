Around 6 works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't confuse the process of using spent coffee grinds as a bulk substrate with using liquid coffee as a supplement to soak grains in prior to sterilization.&amp;nbsp; They're two separate uses.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9789635</next>\n<prev>9789559</prev>\n<first>9789392</first>\n<last>9789702</last>\n<when>1234539562</when>\n<utime>02/13/09 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
