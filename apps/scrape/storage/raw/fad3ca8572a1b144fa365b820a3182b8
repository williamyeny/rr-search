The soap serves as a wetting agent to help hydrate the straw faster.&amp;nbsp; It also helps to knock back some of the contaminants prior to pasteurization. Then, all you do is strain the straw out and place into the pasteurization water at 140F/60C for 90 minutes or so.&amp;nbsp; Then, remove and place it on a rack to drain and inoculate when cool.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to rinse the soap out.&amp;nbsp; Enough will leach out into the pasteurization water that the mycelium will colonize just fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15338099</next>\n<prev>15337731</prev>\n<first>15334808</first>\n<last>15339118</last>\n<when>1320721092</when>\n<utime>11/08/11 04:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
