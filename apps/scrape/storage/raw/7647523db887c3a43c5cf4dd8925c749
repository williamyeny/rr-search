The flies work go into the wine bottle, and then can't get back out.  They don't care much for wind, so set up a few fans in the room on the outside of the greenhouse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the population gets large, they rarely cause problems.  They're attracted to the sweet smelling mycelium and just want to feed.  They tend to go elsewhere to breed, such as in your houseplant soil.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6989691</prev>\n<first>6987890</first>\n<last>6989874</last>\n<when>1180592761</when>\n<utime>05/31/07 09:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
