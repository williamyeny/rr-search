The cow patty actually &lt;u&gt;shades&lt;/u&gt; the mycelium which is growing in the composted grasses below the cow pie.  Cow patties serve a function more as a casing layer than as the substrate in cow pastures.  Mycelium in a jar will cook at those temperatures.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just one of many experiences with incubators that makes me constantly preach using room temperature for incubation.  I haven't used an incubator in many years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6250188</next>\n<prev>6250066</prev>\n<first>6249939</first>\n<last>6250873</last>\n<when>1162758230</when>\n<utime>11/05/06 10:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
