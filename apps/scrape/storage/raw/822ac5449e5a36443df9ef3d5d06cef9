Plastic does not harbor bacterial endospores, and fungi like trichoderma and cobweb are killed by temperatures far below boiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill a pot with water and drop the syringe in.  After the water has boiled for ten minutes, pull the syringe out and suck in the boiling water, swish it around and squirt it out.  Do this a few times.  The syringe will  be sterile enough for mycology, I assure you.  I've done it this way for years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5170378</next>\n<prev>5170282</prev>\n<first>5169683</first>\n<last>5171456</last>\n<when>1137052608</when>\n<utime>01/12/06 09:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
