For my farm, I use an agar wedge to inoculate a quart jar, which then inoculates two filter patch bags with six quarts of rye in each bag.&amp;nbsp; These inoculate ten more bags, and each of those inoculate ten more.&amp;nbsp; I do this one more time and then spawn to bulk.&amp;nbsp; If I go beyond that, fruiting performance is greatly reduced.&amp;nbsp; However, the above turns one small agar wedge of mycelium into 12,000 quarts of colonized rye to spawn to bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously doubt anyone is going to produce that much spawn for cubensis in a lifetime, let alone in a few weeks, so senescence is probably not going to be much of a problem.&amp;nbsp; You're more likely to end up with bacteria contamination at some point in the process, but if you keep dividing jars indefinitely, you're going to have problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11820853</next>\n<prev>11820413</prev>\n<first>10154262</first>\n<last>28135570</last>\n<when>1263400189</when>\n<utime>01/13/10 06:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
