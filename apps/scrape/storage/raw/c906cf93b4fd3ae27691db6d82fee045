This would need to be at least on a 15 amp circuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have an electric stove or water heater?&amp;nbsp; If so, you could use that circuit for your pasteurizer, after shutting off or unplugging the original device while you're using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To calculate amps on a single phase circuit such as you'll find in homes, simply divide the watts by volts.&amp;nbsp; Always derate 20% or so, meaning for example if your circuit draws 19 amps, don't try to use it on&amp;nbsp; 20 amp breaker or fuse.&amp;nbsp; Go to the next larger circuit breaker and appropriate wire size.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14503047</next>\n<prev>14503034</prev>\n<first>14473142</first>\n<last>14513923</last>\n<when>1306239484</when>\n<utime>05/24/11 03:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
