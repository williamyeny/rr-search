In order to maintain 90% RH on an empty GH I need to keep the ultrasonic on the whole time running on medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this normal? All my research I didnt come across a person who had to keep their Ultrasonic on, everyone seemed to have a cycle. Am I missing something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you've already calibrated your hygrometer via the damp towel method. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're going about humidification wrong.&amp;nbsp; Don't 'pipe in' from a cool mist humidifier.&amp;nbsp; They are not designed to develop static pressure, so you're ruining the flow.&amp;nbsp; Also, the mist condenses in the pipe instead of into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the humidity should be introduced at the bottom of the grow area.&amp;nbsp; Humid air is lighter than dry air and will naturally rise.&amp;nbsp; Set the humidifier on the floor of the unit, and cut slits and 'windows' in the plastic for passive fresh air exchange. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17172359</next>\n<prev>17172333</prev>\n<first>17171951</first>\n<last>17173703</last>\n<when>1352230289</when>\n<utime>11/06/12 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
