{"key":"post-8361969","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8361969</id>\n<content>Filter patches are not perfect.  I've often had a single colonizing bag or jar that got trich, and if not noticed in time, it spreads to other nearby jars and/or bags.  The filters will stop 99.9% or more of the spores, but .1% of a few billion is a lot of spores that still escape or find their way into another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd toss it right now.  It won't recover unless you bury it into a manure or coir bed outdoors. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8362399</next>\n<prev>8361923</prev>\n<first>8361923</first>\n<last>8364512</last>\n<when>1209941875</when>\n<utime>05/05/08 01:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
