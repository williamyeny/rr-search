There's no indication that nutrients pass through the cell walls during dunking anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, since mushrooms don't fruit hydroponically, adding liquid at the fruiting stage would have little to no effect.  The mycelial network aborbs its nutrients from the substrate as it consumes it.  The mycelium then produces fruitbodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice experiment though.  It would be interesting to see if the yield increases, but I suspect not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8449945</next>\n<prev>8447667</prev>\n<first>8446641</first>\n<last>8449945</last>\n<when>1211858751</when>\n<utime>05/27/08 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
