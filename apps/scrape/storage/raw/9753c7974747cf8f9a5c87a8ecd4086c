I was only judging my fae off of the fact that I can see the fog pouring out when it's running but I can't be sure it is enough. I will most likely need more holes. I have plenty of diamond hole saws so it's not a problem to make more. My room is constantly 71-74 degrees so I might just leave it alone. So the difference in fruiting times in only a few days when the temp is not 80? If that's the case, I have no problem waiting a little longer. Thanks everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run a space heater in the room if you want to keep it at 75F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never want fog exiting or entering your terrarium.&amp;nbsp; You'll soon learn that if the substrate isn't evaporating moisture, it won't pin.&amp;nbsp; This is why we mist; you let the substrate evaporate and dry out a bit, and then you mist to bring it back up.&amp;nbsp; Steady state moisture content, especially if too wet will lead to poor or no results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19294377</next>\n<prev>19294360</prev>\n<first>19292970</first>\n<last>19295079</last>\n<when>1387413737</when>\n<utime>12/19/13 02:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
