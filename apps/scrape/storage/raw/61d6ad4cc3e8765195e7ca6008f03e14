{"key":"post-6911687","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6911687</id>\n<content>NEVER heat a terrarium. Room temp is what you want to fruit at. You also don't use perlite/water.  You use rinsed, and then well drained perlite.  You want the foil crimped on the tray tight.  Enough will leak around the edges for gas exchange.  I'd let the casing layer colonize at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6911747</next>\n<prev>6911651</prev>\n<first>6911651</first>\n<last>6911747</last>\n<when>1179115030</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 06:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
