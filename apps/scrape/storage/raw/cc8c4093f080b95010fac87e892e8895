Since the jars make their own heat, you only need about 78-80 degree temps. (Something close to that atleast.) An ambient temp of 86 would unecessarily risk contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;83F is not going to produce the fastest growth.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium slows down at any temp of 83 and above.&amp;nbsp; Considering that glass is an insulator, the temperature inside the jars is at least a few degrees warmer.&amp;nbsp; The old figure of fastest growth at a &lt;i&gt;mycelium temperature&lt;/i&gt;, not ambient, of 86 is flat out wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps fastest growth for pf jars is an ambient temp of around 75f to 80F, but higher temps also stimulate bacteria and thermophilic molds.&amp;nbsp; In my mushroom farm, success on every substrate counts more than getting colonized a day or two sooner, so I follow the standard incubation temperature of 69F used by the big commercial mushroom farms, and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11872166</next>\n<prev>11871975</prev>\n<first>11868597</first>\n<last>12280977</last>\n<when>1264102919</when>\n<utime>01/21/10 09:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
