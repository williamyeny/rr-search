That's the sequence I worked out with my vics cool mist and a greenhouse that is easily as large as three marthas.  I get humidity in the mid 90's with zero drips or mess.  Not only that, the coolmist has been running for well over a year now.  When using hoses, max life was measured in weeks.  In addition, I only need to fill the thing once every ten days or so.  Placing the coolmist INSIDE the greenhouse is key.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874593</next>\n<prev>5874549</prev>\n<first>5873249</first>\n<last>5950625</last>\n<when>1153269884</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 03:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
