That will prevent the pins from developing, or will cause them to slow down drastically.  You can lay wax paper over the top of the casing layer or substrate to increase humidity right in that area.  Be sure to lift it up and off when you fan and mist, and don't forget to replace it every second day with a new sheet, and sooner if it gets damp.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6816674</next>\n<prev>6815835</prev>\n<first>6815280</first>\n<last>6816689</last>\n<when>1177181327</when>\n<utime>04/21/07 09:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
