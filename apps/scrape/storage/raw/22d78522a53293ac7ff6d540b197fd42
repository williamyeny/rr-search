It's right up there with 'fractional sterilization' and the 'oven tek'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide has a good use to fight cobweb.  There is little other use for it in mycology, and it should never be used when cloning because it damages the mushroom mycelium as much as molds, so it hurts your culture that you're trying to clone, right at the time you're trying to encourage it to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save it for cobweb attacks.  I don't even use it in the humidifiers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6948226</next>\n<prev>6947078</prev>\n<first>6947061</first>\n<last>14958525</last>\n<when>1179774670</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 10:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
