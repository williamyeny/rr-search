It's way better to let the casing dry out a bit, and give smaller mushies, then to mist and abort them all.  Once the pins are 1 1/2 to 2 inches high, you can begin to mist lightly again. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1824455</next>\n<prev>1824307</prev>\n<first>1822894</first>\n<last>1825283</last>\n<when>1061178426</when>\n<utime>08/18/03 06:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
