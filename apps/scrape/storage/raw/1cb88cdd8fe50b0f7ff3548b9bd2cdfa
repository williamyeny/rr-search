{"key":"post-6287874","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6287874</id>\n<content>Just make sure the grains are dry on the surface when you load the jars.  A &lt;i&gt;little bit&lt;/i&gt; on the wet side won't stop the mycelium, so that isn't the problem.  What sort of gas exchange are you using?  If the grains are not too wet, the next biggest cause of slow growth is running out of oxygen, so make sure you have provisions for gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't expose the jars to high temperatures.  Consider 80F maximum.  I use room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6287892</next>\n<prev>6287862</prev>\n<first>6287684</first>\n<last>6290874</last>\n<when>1163654920</when>\n<utime>11/16/06 07:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
