I don't do it, but I also know what to look for and can spot contaminants before they can hurt.  Pasteurizing kills the molds and mold spores that are in the material, so you start out fresh.  Sterilizing kills everything, which leaves the substrate a prime food source for whatever is first to land on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6545762</next>\n<prev>6545696</prev>\n<first>6545101</first>\n<last>6546001</last>\n<when>1170993073</when>\n<utime>02/09/07 05:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
