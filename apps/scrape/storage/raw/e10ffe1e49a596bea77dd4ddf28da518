Isn't that what our moms called it when we soiled our diapers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please. . .It's manure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cow and horse manure are equally suitable for growing dung and straw loving mushrooms.  Getting the texture right is part of the skills of growing. Horse manure is ready to use once it's been field aged.  Cow manure works better when fluffed up with verm, coir, straw, etc., but it's all good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8003906</next>\n<prev>8003841</prev>\n<first>7998586</first>\n<last>8034426</last>\n<when>1202658426</when>\n<utime>02/10/08 05:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
