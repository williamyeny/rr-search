Re-dunk your cakes, drill holes in all six sides per the shotgun terrarium tek and put five inches of well drained perlite in there.&amp;nbsp; You'll have a flush in a few days.&amp;nbsp; Your cakes are dry.&amp;nbsp; 90% humidity is not sufficient for cakes, which need 95% or better to perform properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have to mist regardless of the 'tek' you use for fruiting.&amp;nbsp; If you provide proper fresh air, your cakes will dry out, even at 99%.&amp;nbsp; You'll just have to mist before you leave, and again when you get home.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9975207</next>\n<prev>9974150</prev>\n<first>9973347</first>\n<last>9975207</last>\n<when>1237098066</when>\n<utime>03/15/09 09:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
