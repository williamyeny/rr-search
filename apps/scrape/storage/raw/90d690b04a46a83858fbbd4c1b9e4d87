{"key":"post-6580890","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6580890</id>\n<content>What grade of vermiculite are you using?  It ranges from the size of corn(course) to half the size of a grain of rice or smaller.(fine)  Perhaps you're using a grade that's too course and the brf is just settling in around the vermiculite.  To overcome this problem, one should always slap the sides of the jar a few times while filling so the contents settle into place.  Don't pack it by any means, but by tapping the side of the jar, the vibration will arrange the contents so they don't settle later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6580903</next>\n<prev>6580856</prev>\n<first>6579961</first>\n<last>6581534</last>\n<when>1171817387</when>\n<utime>02/18/07 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
