But fungi, in general, don't use light for energy because they don't perform any kind of photosynthesis, no? Do they make use of light for energy in some other way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't perform photosynthesis, but they do use light for energy.&amp;nbsp; That is a well established fact.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms and plants are not even in the same kingdom. Mushrooms are as different from plants as humans are. In fact, mushrooms are much more closely related to humans than to plants.&amp;nbsp; We're both part of the same super kingdom, &lt;i&gt;Opisthokonta&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms will grow towards a light because they are deriving energy.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown with insufficient light will be thin, have small caps, and very little weight.&amp;nbsp; The same strain on the same cakes given proper lighting will be large and much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11115687</next>\n<prev>11115443</prev>\n<first>11113438</first>\n<last>11117555</last>\n<when>1253762743</when>\n<utime>09/24/09 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
