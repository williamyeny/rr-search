{"key":"post-6286257","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6286257</id>\n<content>A very small substrate with 1&quot; of casing material will probably never colonize the casing layer enough to fruit.  Normally, I don't recommend messing with something already finished, but you should scrape half or more of that casing layer off.  Even it out at 1/4 to 1/2&quot; deep and then cover with foil to allow it to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put jars into the refrigerator to stall them, they should be removed three days before spawning to allow the mycelium to slowly come back to room temperature and recover.   If you'll be using them within two weeks of full colonization, just leave them on a shelf at room temperature, but don't refrigerate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6287160</next>\n<prev>6286190</prev>\n<first>6283423</first>\n<last>6293800</last>\n<when>1163625000</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 11:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
