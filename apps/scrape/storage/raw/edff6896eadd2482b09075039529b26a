Read every single post going back 50 pages of this forum, and every single one of your questions will be answered several times, and you'll learn all about the hobby.  You can do it in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're doing everything backwards, yet you keep asking how it's going to turn out.  Nobody knows how because nobody does it like that.  It's incorrect as etam just said.  Please spend a few hours or even a few days reading, then come back with informed questions and we'll all try to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody can tell you what strain that is.  Mushrooms have tens of thousands of sexes, so many strains emerge from every squirt of spores.  The name on the syringe is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6559720</next>\n<prev>6558858</prev>\n<first>6557436</first>\n<last>6563648</last>\n<when>1171322208</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 01:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
