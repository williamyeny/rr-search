He used a 3 year old syringe of creeper strain for each WBS jar which resulted in the varying cap/shrooms in each respective sub container. Still doesn't jive, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing crap is why everyone is confused.&amp;nbsp; There is no such thing as creeper strain or any other strain which can be grown from spores.&amp;nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, and each viable spore creates one hyphae.&amp;nbsp; Since a sporeprint has many millions of spores, there are millions of strains going to be produced, not one strain regardless of the name someone wrote on the print or syringe to sell it to noobs who think it's going to perform differently than another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some legitimate vendors who have narrowed down the gene pool to provide consistent results, ie albinos, PE, etc.,(check out posts by workman) but by far most of the people selling spores are unscrupulous and simply label the random syringe or print with whatever 'name' the person orders.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>16334850</prev>\n<first>16333738</first>\n<last>16334905</last>\n<when>1338903114</when>\n<utime>06/05/12 04:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
