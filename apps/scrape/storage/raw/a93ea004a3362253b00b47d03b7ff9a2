We use coffee water diluted down to soak the grain spawn in during the grain prep but coffee is just asking for trouble without any real added benefit that you wouldn't have already got from soaking in coffee water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent coffee grinds are an excellent bulk substrate additive.&amp;nbsp; It has nothing to do with soaking grains in dilute liquid coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, toss those out and ask your friend to either freeze the coffee grinds or dry them before saving.&amp;nbsp; If you leave them wet, they'll mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19820796</next>\n<prev>19820548</prev>\n<first>19819213</first>\n<last>19837266</last>\n<when>1397099955</when>\n<utime>04/10/14 06:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
