Set it near them and they'll start drinking.  The ants will eat up the borax/karo, then take it back to the nest to feed the entire colony including the queens.  It takes about a week, and the whole colony is wiped out.  This works for those black wood ants that eat holes in your house too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5628504</next>\n<prev>5628484</prev>\n<first>5628462</first>\n<last>5630191</last>\n<when>1147636609</when>\n<utime>05/14/06 10:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
