{"key":"post-6208709","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6208709</id>\n<content>I brought an infrared imaging device home from work once and measured colonizing jars of mycleium.  It was wild to look at.  Blue shelves, with bright orange and red jars sitting on them, and the sawdust bags supplemented with wheat bran were white hot.  I could actually tell how far along the jars and bags were colonized by the heat signature coming off them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Stamets says he doesn't heat his incubation rooms, even in the middle of winter.  There is enough heat coming off all the substrate bags to heat the entire building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big problem with incubators is that at least twice a week we get a post to the effect of &quot;are my jars toast?&quot; because somebody's heater stuck and their incbator was over 100F while they were gone to work all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no question that jars, especially pints and half-pints will colonize faster at 82F, then at the 75F I recommend, but is it worth the expense and risk for two to three days at most faster colonization?  I say no.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6208541</prev>\n<first>6202050</first>\n<last>6208709</last>\n<when>1161751012</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 07:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
