I did a lot of work with them in the 80's developing cooling/heating systems for satellites.  They fit the bill for that application because of small size and the ability to reverse the DC current to change from heating to cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their small size means you'd need a LOT of them to do much good in a fruiting chamber.  That could get prohibitively expensive.  Also remember, whenever one side of the chip is heating, the other side is cooling, which creates it's own set of problems if used in mycology.  It's interesting stuff though.  I've seen them on high end computers to help wick heat away from the processor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6619911</prev>\n<first>6619911</first>\n<last>6619957</last>\n<when>1172683948</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 07:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
