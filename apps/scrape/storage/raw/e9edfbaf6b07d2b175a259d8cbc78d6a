Keep them at 99% humidity and normal room temperature.  Inoculate a few cakes with oysters and cook them up for the family in an omlette. Then you won't have to worry about kids.

At least, that's how I raised mine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6872128</next>\n<prev>6871787</prev>\n<first>6870967</first>\n<last>11290471</last>\n<when>1178297606</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 07:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
