I was wondering if there was such a thing and if there was does anyone have any pictures of what it looks like. Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, your friend doesn't have a clue.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium doesn't have a urinary tract, and mycelium doesn't pee.&amp;nbsp; This has all been covered many times before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fungi mycelium from molds to mushroom, will secrete antibiotic compounds to help fight off competitor fungi or bacteria.&amp;nbsp; These can be from clear to bright red, depending on species of fungi.&amp;nbsp; They are easily distinguishable from molds such as the geotrichum shown above.&amp;nbsp; Mold spores are powdery, while metabolites are liquid.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8763400</next>\n<prev>8751953</prev>\n<first>8720180</first>\n<last>8763400</last>\n<when>1218389206</when>\n<utime>08/10/08 08:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
