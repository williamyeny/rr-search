Mix your grains into the manure, then cover and allow to colonize for ten days to two weeks, or however long it takes to get full colonization.  THEN, add half an inch or so of peat/verm or even straight verm on top for a casing layer.  You can also simply fruit the horse manure substrate without a casing if you chose, but fruits will be a bit smaller.  If you leave it uncased, you'll get your harvest a bit sooner however, which helps offset the smaller mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5364684</next>\n<prev>5364542</prev>\n<first>5364467</first>\n<last>5369963</last>\n<when>1141503038</when>\n<utime>03/04/06 10:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
