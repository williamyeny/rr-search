{"key":"post-6910329","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6910329</id>\n<content>People will get much better answers when they stop talking about 'jars' as if the mycelium is colonizing glass.  Some types of growing such as grains, require tyvek, polyfill, or synthetic filter disks so if you leave the lids loose, the contaminants will take the path of least resistance, which is around the filter and through the loose lid contaminating the contents.  Other types of growing use a dry verm barrier on top, so it matters little if the lid is loose or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please phrase questions to reflect the type of growing you're trying to do.  For example, &quot;Is it ok, or even recommended to leave the lids loose on pf type jars with a dry verm barrier&quot;?  Or, &quot;should I leave the lids loose on my tyvek filtered wbs jars&quot;?  You'll get far better answers by following the above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6910878</next>\n<prev>6910249</prev>\n<first>6909823</first>\n<last>6911350</last>\n<when>1179093117</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 12:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
