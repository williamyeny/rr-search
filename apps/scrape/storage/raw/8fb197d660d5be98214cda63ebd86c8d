You'll get a very poor pinset without several air exchanges per day at the very least.  Four to five per hour are recommended.  Water beads on the inside of the terrarium have NOTHING to do with humidity.  They indicate a temperature differential, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want your light outside the terrarium.  Fluorescent ballasts generate a high voltage, and that doesn't go with near saturation humidity at all.  In addition, a fluroescent ballast and light inside will heat your terrarium a lot.  It will be over 90F in there within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the heat will lower humidity, not raise it.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7097382</next>\n<prev>7097136</prev>\n<first>7096987</first>\n<last>7101648</last>\n<when>1182924628</when>\n<utime>06/27/07 09:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
