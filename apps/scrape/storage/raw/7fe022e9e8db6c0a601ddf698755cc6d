I just trashed it yesterday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That jar should have been trashed a week ago.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest setting the rest of the jars out in the open at room temperature and leaving them alone for a week. If they're going to recover, they will have by then.  Normally they're finished within two to three weeks, so in another week, if you still have nothing, boil them for a couple of hours, then clean out the contents and start over.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6755400</next>\n<prev>6755316</prev>\n<first>6755076</first>\n<last>6756038</last>\n<when>1175907104</when>\n<utime>04/07/07 03:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
