If you open windows near your greenhouse or terrarium, it won't hurt at all.  In fact, I have a 4&quot; clothes dryer hose connecting my mini greenhouse to the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you shut everything before you do any sterile work.  You want totally still air for that, plus a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6133479</prev>\n<first>6133479</first>\n<last>6133529</last>\n<when>1160009491</when>\n<utime>10/05/06 03:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
