{"key":"post-6796311","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6796311</id>\n<content>I used humidistats for years, but got tired of having to replace them after every major spores release.  The spores ruin them.  I finally switched back to cycle timers.  Very short cycles are the key to proper humidity without excessive dripping.  Get one that can be adjusted down to 1 minute on, three to four minutes off.  Search my name for cycle timers and humidistats to get information and links to purchase both.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6795981</prev>\n<first>6795965</first>\n<last>6796311</last>\n<when>1176772277</when>\n<utime>04/17/07 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
