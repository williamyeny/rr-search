You want the caps nice and dry so they won't mold or harbor bacteria during printing.  It doesn't matter if a few trich spores are on the mushroom cap because it's going to puke out a billion or so spores, and chances are, any spores that have landed on it will stay there.  If you're worried, you can always lay the cap on a piece of hardware cloth and let the spores fall through that to your printing surface.  I really like using a tyvek sheet over the caps as they print.  It allows air exchange and at the same time protects the area from contaminants as the print is making.  A one square yard sheet will cover a whole lot of printing caps.  You can get kite grade tyvek at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intothewind.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.intothewind.com&lt;/a&gt;  In my opinion, it's far superior to the post office tyvek.  It's thicker too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5570370</next>\n<prev>5568128</prev>\n<first>5567861</first>\n<last>5570370</last>\n<when>1146281947</when>\n<utime>04/29/06 06:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
