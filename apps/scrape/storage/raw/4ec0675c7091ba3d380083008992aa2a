If you live in an area with acidic soil, lime is at every hardware and garden center.  If you can't find it, you can order hydrated garden lime at doitbest.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peat/verm makes an excellent casing material.   Coir is a great substrate, so you could spawn your grain or brf jars to the coir, then when the coir is fully colonized, case it with the peat/verm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't lime the casing for the mushroom mycelium.  Nearly all fungi prefer a ph of around 6.  We use lime to get a ph of 8 to 8.5 because mushroom mycelium can &lt;i&gt;tolerate&lt;/i&gt; that high ph, but mold spores such as trichoderma and cobweb have a hard time getting a foothold in a high ph environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck Mrs and keep searching.  You'll find the answers you need.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6143246</next>\n<prev>6143174</prev>\n<first>6143096</first>\n<last>6143323</last>\n<when>1160244624</when>\n<utime>10/07/06 09:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
