So, i guess that made it start to grow sooner but i dont know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.&amp;nbsp; The 100% humidity is going to get the 'dry' verm filter wet and ruin it.&amp;nbsp; Jars should be placed on a shelf at normal indoor room temperature for best results.&amp;nbsp; A higher temp will tend to speed up growth slightly, but greatly increases risk of contamination.&amp;nbsp; Experience has taught it's best to go with what has the highest chance of success.&amp;nbsp; Compare it to getting a job with a paycheck instead of taking your last $5 to Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16436316</next>\n<prev>16436165</prev>\n<first>16436018</first>\n<last>16438311</last>\n<when>1340660006</when>\n<utime>06/26/12 12:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
