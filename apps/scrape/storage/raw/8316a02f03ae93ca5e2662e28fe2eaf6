Be sure all fans, AC units, HEPA filters, etc., are turned off when you work.  If you're going to leave it open, I suggest cutting smaller holes that just fit your arms.  Be sure to wear a freshly laundered long sleeve shirt and latex gloves when you work. Don't stick your bare arms in there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874370</next>\n<prev>5874170</prev>\n<first>5874170</first>\n<last>5878629</last>\n<when>1153264649</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 02:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
