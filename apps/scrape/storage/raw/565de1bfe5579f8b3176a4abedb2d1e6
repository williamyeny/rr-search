The math is mind boggling, but by using grain to grain transfers, you can expand your mycelium by a million times very quickly.  Commercial spawn producers do this on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, nobody can predict yield.  Start small, and work up.  Hope for the best, but be prepared to be happy with a small flush the first few tries.  1/2 pint jars work best for pf style grows, not pints.  If you want more, use more jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6584528</next>\n<prev>6584502</prev>\n<first>6583531</first>\n<last>6587769</last>\n<when>1171897689</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 05:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
