Fold the bag carefully along the creases, but before rolling it up, stick a sheet of tyvek or even a clean piece of cloth the length of the bag from the top to the substrate.  The cloth will allow a path for steam to escape, then as the PC cools, the plastic will draw tight and the cloth will serve as a filter until you remove the bag.  This allows people without a clean room for the PC to cool in to use bags.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6255692</next>\n<prev>6255537</prev>\n<first>6255525</first>\n<last>6255946</last>\n<when>1162875849</when>\n<utime>11/07/06 07:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
