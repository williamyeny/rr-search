I've experiment with 1.2kg, 2.5kg, 4kg, and 7kg bags full of substrate. And the highest yield goes to the 1.2kg bags(the smallest bags).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of you guys know what are the reasons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can share your own experience in this thread if you like, it would be very appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bags are plastic and nothing grows on plastic.&amp;nbsp; It does no good to say 'bags' if you don't say what is IN them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we've known for decades, smaller substrates are more efficient by far than larger substrates.&amp;nbsp; That's why brf cakes are the most efficient substrate of all from a biological efficiency standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For preparing grain spawn, larger containers get more sterilized thus are more efficient as long as one can work them properly and not get contaminated, which results in a greater loss the larger the bag size.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18593301</next>\n<prev>18593126</prev>\n<first>18593046</first>\n<last>18632575</last>\n<when>1374496906</when>\n<utime>07/22/13 03:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
