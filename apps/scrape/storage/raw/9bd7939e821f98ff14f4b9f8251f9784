Water will always drip out of a straw log for a day or two, so be sure to keep a tray on the shelf below it so you don't make a mess.  If it was wet down there, that's the reason it's behind.  I don't use bleach 'pasteurization' because bleach kills too many of the beneficial bacteria that we're trying to preserve. We use heat and lime to kill molds and mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6522647</next>\n<prev>6521257</prev>\n<first>6519155</first>\n<last>6522880</last>\n<when>1170402648</when>\n<utime>02/02/07 09:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
