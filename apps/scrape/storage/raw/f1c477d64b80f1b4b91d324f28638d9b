Horse manure does not increase potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn does not harbor green mold. Molds are killed off by temperatures well below boiling. It has a high &lt;i&gt;bacterial endospore&lt;/i&gt; count, but that's not the only reason it's inferior to other grains.  The main reason is that the large kernel size means you have far less mycelium per jar than you'd have with traditional grains such as rye or wbs.  It takes at least four jars of popcorn to have the same amount of mycelium as one similar sized jar of rye or wbs.  That's why it's rarely used anymore.  I recently tossed out a huge bag of it, because I don't like getting popped corn stuck in my teeth, and it sucks as a spawn medium, unless you have no other options.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6763134</next>\n<prev>6762709</prev>\n<first>6762089</first>\n<last>6764769</last>\n<when>1176087922</when>\n<utime>04/09/07 06:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
