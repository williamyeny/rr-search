{"key":"post-7108344","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7108344</id>\n<content>The difference between a boiling kettle of water and an oven is that the steam provides a 100% humidity environment, which an oven does not.  Thus, your substrate does not lose moisture when surrounded by steam.  If you want to sterilize in an oven, put your substate in a jar without holes in the lid and set the oven to 225F.  Hopefully, your jar can withstand the pressure created and not explode.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7108414</next>\n<prev>7108312</prev>\n<first>7051427</first>\n<last>7254458</last>\n<when>1183163159</when>\n<utime>06/30/07 03:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
