For growing cubensis, coir is the equal of horse manure.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to hear about 'nutes', because mushrooms aren't plants.&amp;nbsp; Every time I hear about NPK or 'Nitrogen', the hair on my neck stands up.&amp;nbsp; The biggest and best mushrooms grow on straw.&amp;nbsp; Any idea what the NPK of uncomposted straw is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Nobody knows how P cubensis spread around the world.&amp;nbsp; There's only speculation, and that's like opinions and assholes, which everyone has.&amp;nbsp; They could have come with the cattle, or they could have come on the wind, or they could have evolved where ever they're found, including the Americas.&amp;nbsp; Just because there's no written records from the native Americans who didn't write, doesn't mean they weren't here, whether they ate them or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Mushroom spores can survive a cow's stomach.&amp;nbsp; That's one of the ways they're spread.&amp;nbsp; Ever use non-composted cow or horse manure in a garden?&amp;nbsp; It's full of weed seeds which sprout and grow.&amp;nbsp; Spores do the same.&amp;nbsp; It's also common for spores to land on the grass and then a cow dumps on them.&amp;nbsp; There's more than one means of dispersal.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13166138</next>\n<prev>13166108</prev>\n<first>13159963</first>\n<last>13166138</last>\n<when>1283984679</when>\n<utime>09/09/10 01:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
