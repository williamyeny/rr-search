It is largely a tourist attraction, so those types of things are unheard of. The nearest one is hours away. Thanks anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like you're not really serious about getting into this hobby.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live an hour into the mountains from a town of only 600 people(the county seat), which also happens to be a tourist town.&amp;nbsp; It's three hours to the nearest Lowes or Home Depot type of store, and I've had walmart on my boycott list since 1982, even though the nearest walmart is also 3 hours away, and I've never had trouble finding vermiculite.&amp;nbsp; Even the mom-and-pop grocery store has it, as does the tiny one-room hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't want to drive as far for vermiculite as I have to for a gallon of milk, simply ask your local store to order some for you or use one of the links I've posted in the past to order large bags of fine grade vermiculite online.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>16222615</prev>\n<first>16222293</first>\n<last>16223219</last>\n<when>1336914698</when>\n<utime>05/13/12 04:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
