Clean up the best you can.  The biggest impact is on your sterile work, which is going to get harder.  Fruiting chambers need a LOT of air exchange, and so-called incubation chambers are dumb. If you have a spot in your house that's 75F, use it.  If not, get one.  You don't need to 'incubate' unless you're trying to hatch chiken eggs.  Incubators are directly responsible for a lot of the contamination people experience.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7952240</next>\n<prev>7948422</prev>\n<first>7948422</first>\n<last>7952240</last>\n<when>1201657485</when>\n<utime>01/30/08 03:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
