I am fully aware that this was a ghetto technique...I expect high contamination rates. The point of the post is to illustrate that dried sclerotia remain viable, information which I could not find on this forum prior to posting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a well-known fact that the evolutionary purpose of sclerotia is to allow the mycelium to dry totally out during adverse weather conditions and then rejuvenate once the weather returns to a more suitable state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I and others have posted many threads showing how sclerotia can be used as inoculant for agar.&amp;nbsp; You cut from the center of a freshly broken piece of sclerotia to reduce the ambient contaminant load.&amp;nbsp; Once transferred, anything you see within 48 to 60 hours is a contaminant, so you're growing 100% contams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes much longer than that for the dry sclerotia to hydrate and become active again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18866849</next>\n<prev>18866833</prev>\n<first>18866577</first>\n<last>18866884</last>\n<when>1379690874</when>\n<utime>09/20/13 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
