Is your casing or your bulk substrate contaminating?  There's a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you don't pasteurize for an hour total.  You maintain a temperature of 140F to 160F in the center of the material for one hour.  The whole process usually takes two hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was your casing material and how did you pasteurize it?  Obviously if seeds are sprouting, it wasn't properly pasteurized or the seeds would have been killed off along with the mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7539244</next>\n<prev>7538840</prev>\n<first>7538840</first>\n<last>7539301</last>\n<when>1192901298</when>\n<utime>10/20/07 08:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
