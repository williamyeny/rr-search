For your information, I do place the jars for recycle, but I won't open them in the house.  If you think pouring soap and bleach down the drain is less harmful to the environment than a jar going to the recycle bin, you're mistaken.  In addition, it takes oil-based energy from terrorist sponsoring nations in the middle east to sterilize the jars twice, so your point is well taken but misinformed.  Don't lecture people here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6689384</prev>\n<first>6682826</first>\n<last>6689687</last>\n<when>1174365803</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 07:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
