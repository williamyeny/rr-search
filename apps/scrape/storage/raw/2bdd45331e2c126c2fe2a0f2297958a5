{"key":"post-7822961","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7822961</id>\n<content>I once used duct tape(NOT duck tape) to repair the wing of an airplane that was heavily damaged by trees on a landing-gone-bad in the Alaska wilderness.  Not only did the guy fly the plane out of that remote airstrip, but I caught up to him two weeks later in Anchorage, and he was still flying the plane around with half the wing held together by duct tape.  Not recommended, but good stuff.  I carry a roll of it in the back of my airplane at all times for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use micropore tape on jars.  If you're wanting to make your own spawn bags, I doubt you can do it for less than the 40 cents the premade ones with filters cost.  Either way, I'd suggest an impulse sealer over tape, if you want to make your own.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7824003</next>\n<prev>7822629</prev>\n<first>7804434</first>\n<last>7838690</last>\n<when>1199290765</when>\n<utime>01/02/08 06:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
