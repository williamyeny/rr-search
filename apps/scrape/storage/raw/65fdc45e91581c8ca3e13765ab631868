If pins will be damaged by picking a large fruit nearby, then simply cut off the stem of the fruit just above the surface of the substrate so as not to disturb the pins around it.  Remove the 'stump' when you harvest the rest.  There is absolutely no reason to feel you have to pick all the fruits from a cake or casing at the same time or even within a day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5550778</next>\n<prev>5550680</prev>\n<first>5550657</first>\n<last>5551691</last>\n<when>1145898605</when>\n<utime>04/24/06 08:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
