{"key":"post-7640824","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7640824</id>\n<content>I use an electric weed whacker with the straw in a tote with the lid on it.  I cut a very skinny rectangle out of the center of the lid so I can move the weed eater around in the box to get it all.  It takes about five minutes or less to do a 125 quart sterlite container full of straw.  I do this right in my living room, since I also live in a condo.  There's some mess, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7643346</next>\n<prev>7640495</prev>\n<first>7636872</first>\n<last>7643520</last>\n<when>1195172674</when>\n<utime>11/16/07 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
