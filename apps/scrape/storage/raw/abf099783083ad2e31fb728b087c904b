This light also has to pass through a blue colored lid to reach the mushroom. Is the blue light (not being white light) the culprit? Is the bluish light confusing them so much so that they go all funny? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the most likely scenario.&amp;nbsp; 15 watt isn't bright enough, and if it passes through a blue lid, it filters all the blue light out, which is what the mushrooms need for development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, get a brighter light and use a clear lid and tub as has been recommended for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use fresh spawn and substrates, not 8 months old.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15817968</next>\n<prev>15817815</prev>\n<first>15817761</first>\n<last>15822532</last>\n<when>1329411052</when>\n<utime>02/16/12 06:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
