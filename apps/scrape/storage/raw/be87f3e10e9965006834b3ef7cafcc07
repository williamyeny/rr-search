Mushroom mycelium prefers a pH of 5 to 6, so you're fine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We pH balance casing layers because they're left exposed and non-colonized on top of the substrate.  For casing layers, hydrated lime is best because it goes to work right away.  Calcium carbonate takes time to break down, so is of less use since the average life of a casing is only a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7343709</next>\n<prev>7338547</prev>\n<first>7338237</first>\n<last>7344829</last>\n<when>1188218606</when>\n<utime>08/27/07 03:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
