{"key":"post-6022029","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6022029</id>\n<content>Shaking right after inoculation was a mistake.  You should allow the spores to germinate in close proximity to each other so they can pair up and become dikaryotic.  Monokaryotic mycelium is thinner and much slower growing than dikaryotic mycelium.   By shaking the jar, you required it to colonize with the slower growing monokaryons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will recover, but be slower.  Next time, shoot the spores down the side of the glass at the edges.  Don't shake afterward for several days until 20% or so of the rye berries are colonized.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6022036</next>\n<prev>6022007</prev>\n<first>6021925</first>\n<last>6022100</last>\n<when>1157218922</when>\n<utime>09/02/06 08:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
