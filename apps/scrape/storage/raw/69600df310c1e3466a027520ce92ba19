I've personally never done it, although I'm sure someone has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt you got enough moisture into your popcorn.  The boil is mandatory in my opinion.  I think it's also a good idea to rinse the popcorn really well before the 24 hour soak.  Put the popcorn in a large pot and fill it with water.  Stir it around and drain the water out.  Do this until the water pours off clear.  This will get rid of all the grain dust and other nasties that will tend to make sludge in the bottom of your jars later.   Good luck.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3870181</next>\n<prev>3869929</prev>\n<first>3869929</first>\n<last>7556220</last>\n<when>1109994195</when>\n<utime>03/05/05 05:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
