Open the receiving jars one at a time, setting the lid upside down on the jar next to it.  This means you'll have three jars side by side right up against the face of the hood.  Keep them in the center. You can 'pour and twist' from the grain master to the receiving jars.  Break up the grains in the master by banging it against a fully inflated tire. Remember to caulk across the front where the flowhood sits on your table.  Don't use the last 1&quot; around the edges of the filter because contaminants are drawn into that area from outside the stream. Be sure to wipe all jars down with alcohol before opening, and allow the flowhood to run for half an hour before starting work.  Don't talk to anyone during work because the speed of the air and spit leaving your mouth is much faster than the air leaving the flowhood and will easily overwhelm it. Following the above will get you as close to 100% success as you can get once you get the hang of things.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5979962</prev>\n<first>5979962</first>\n<last>5980194</last>\n<when>1156047783</when>\n<utime>08/20/06 07:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
