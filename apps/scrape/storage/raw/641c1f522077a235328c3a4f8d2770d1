I wouldnt worry about it, just if you see if pooling up make sure you take a clean paper towel or something and soak it up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not even a waste product, and people who call it piss are ignorant.&amp;nbsp; The liquid is excreted to help break down the substrate, and in a different formulation is produced to fight contaminant molds and bacteria.&amp;nbsp; These are the products antibiotics are made of.&amp;nbsp; Don't you think your doctor would call you mental if you got an STD and told him you need a shot of myc piss?&amp;nbsp; Why people deliberately keep spreading bad info around here I'll never figure out.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't make them look smart. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, it sounds like you have a serious contamination problem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16096777</next>\n<prev>16096621</prev>\n<first>16095110</first>\n<last>16096777</last>\n<when>1334586919</when>\n<utime>04/16/12 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
