When you inoculate with multispore, you get hundreds, sometimes thousands of strains. Remember, a &lt;i&gt;strain&lt;/i&gt; is a dikaryotic pairing of hyphae from two compatible spores. It doesn't matter one whit if they came from different so-called 'named' strains any more than if a chinese and an african human mate.  The genes mix, they don't fight.  The process of anastomosis will generally combine the mycelium into a single network by the time of full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a few searches along these lines and you guys will find several recent grows where people did just this and got normal results.  I've done it myself many times.  There is no more difference in the genetic ability to combine hyphae from spores on the same print than if you mix those spores with a print from the other side of the world.  Remember, it's the same species.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6176275</prev>\n<first>6176111</first>\n<last>6176972</last>\n<when>1161059684</when>\n<utime>10/17/06 07:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
