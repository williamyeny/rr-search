I use a super allergen type furnace filter simply duct taped over the intake of the squirrel cage fan.  You can disregard the impedence of the prefilter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to get a laminar flow hepa filter.  They're usually made from ceramic and aluminum.  As a rule of thumb, you can just figure on 1&quot; of static pressure being standard.  Some filters are rated .9 and others might be as high as 1.3 or so.  In the US, most squirrel cage blowers with a CFM rating have it based on that 1&quot; of static pressure.  Because of that, just disregard static pressure and look at cfm.(I can feel anno squirming as I say that...lol)  You want between 100 and 150 &lt;i&gt;linear&lt;/i&gt; feet per minute passing over your work space.  So, a two square foot filter would need between a 200 and 300 cfm blower to deliver that velocity.  Don't forget to build a plenum behind the filter for the fan to pressurize to the 1&quot; of static pressure.  The static pressure on the back side of the filter is how we get the even flow out the front to our work area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5706008</next>\n<prev>5702048</prev>\n<first>5702048</first>\n<last>5706685</last>\n<when>1149235737</when>\n<utime>06/02/06 11:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
