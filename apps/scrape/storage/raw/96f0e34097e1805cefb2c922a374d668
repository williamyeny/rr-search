Molds are killed by temps far below boiling, so it's not a surprise it didn't turn green.  Bacteria is a far bigger problem with fractional sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially how they sterilize grains in large quantities in the orient using 55 gallon drums.  It fails as often as it works, but when you own or manage the wheat field it really doesn't matter.  You can still feed the spoiled grains to the pigs.  Most of us value our time more than to spend three days to save 20 bucks on a used pc, but to each his own.  There's always the pf tek as well, and cakes make excellent spawn to bulk for those without a pc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6675308</next>\n<prev>6674631</prev>\n<first>4702138</first>\n<last>14571205</last>\n<when>1174019241</when>\n<utime>03/16/07 07:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
