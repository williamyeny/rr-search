Even with foil on the jars, the rapidly boiling water will work up under the foil and get in.&amp;nbsp; This isn't a problem with quart/liter size jars, but it's definitely a problem with 1/2 pints.&amp;nbsp; By keeping the jars out of the water, the problem is solved.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn't mean if the water comes 1/2 inch up from the bottom of the jars it will ruin them, but more than that and it will.&amp;nbsp; However, if we say 1/2&quot; to the fractionally literate among us, they'll read it as 1/2 way up the jars and then wonder why their moisture content got ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that makes it clear.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16370389</next>\n<prev>16370013</prev>\n<first>16368414</first>\n<last>16371276</last>\n<when>1339520809</when>\n<utime>06/12/12 08:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
