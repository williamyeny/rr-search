When used as a casing material however, it just seems to colonize fully, which in my opinion is more like adding another half inch or so of substrate. It certainly doesn't hurt though, as the more varied the nutrient source, the better the results.  I've seen some very nice flushes from trays with a top layer of coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5348433</next>\n<prev>5348090</prev>\n<first>2480695</first>\n<last>23893521</last>\n<when>1141129207</when>\n<utime>02/28/06 02:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
