He decided to crumble and case them and got a half ounce off each of them. After that he decided that it was to expensive to bye the pre-made myco-bags so he learned how to prepare WBS (really easy) and load his own bags that he byes from sporeworks steralizes them, inoculates, and either cases the WBS or spawns bulk and he has tremendous succes. He thinks its the best way to go. WBS is the best substrate to inoculate. It stays all contained so thier is a lower chance for contams. And you have way more substrate to work with. In his opinion its the cleanest, easiest, and fastest way for larger yields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see that many misspelled words and sloppy grammar in a single paragraph, put a grain of salt on it.&amp;nbsp; WBS is not the best, it's not going to give a lower chance of contamination, and it's not the cleanest.&amp;nbsp;  It is however, a cheap alternative if you can't afford or find organic rye berries, which are superior in every way for expanding mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9658322</next>\n<prev>9657980</prev>\n<first>9657472</first>\n<last>9658322</last>\n<when>1232648107</when>\n<utime>01/22/09 08:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
