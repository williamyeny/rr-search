I'll venture to say that many of the growers here don't even eat psilocybe mushrooms, and others stick to once or twice per year.  It's about the challenge of growing as many species as one can.  The edibles are fun too, because they're so much harder and more of a challenge.  They also taste so good fried up for breakfast or cooked on the BBQ grill outside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5977114</next>\n<prev>5977042</prev>\n<first>5976756</first>\n<last>7313467</last>\n<when>1155957963</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 06:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
