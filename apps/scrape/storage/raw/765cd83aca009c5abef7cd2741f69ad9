They'll have what you're looking for.  Get a mechanical, NOT digital hygrometer, and mount it inside the grow area.  In fact, get several and place them in various areas so you can adjust your circulation to avoid humidity stratificaton zones.  Don't forget to calibrate when you get them home and calibrate weekly for the first month, and then monthly after that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6985306</next>\n<prev>6985213</prev>\n<first>6985213</first>\n<last>6986175</last>\n<when>1180507344</when>\n<utime>05/30/07 09:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
