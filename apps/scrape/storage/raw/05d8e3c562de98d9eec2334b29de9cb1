I've proved that for many years.  Gypsum adds calcium and sulfur, both essential mushroom nutrients and can provide for up to a 25% increase in yields.  In addition, gypsum prevents the grains from sticking together, which makes it harder for the mycelium to colonize.  There's not a commercial grow operation in the world that doesn't use gypsum, and their livelihood depends on maximizing yields and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common mistake with coffee is using it too strong.  As I've said countless times, it needs to be at 1/2 normal drinking strength.  That means if you use a standard amount of coffee in your trusty Mr coffee, mix it half and half with plain water after brewing, and then use that to hydrate your grains.  Mixing it stronger is counterproductive and will increase colonization times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7006019</next>\n<prev>7005745</prev>\n<first>7004249</first>\n<last>7011887</last>\n<when>1180933703</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 08:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
