If it was contaminated how could mycelium form? I have never read or heard that but that would suck because that is all I have left for the rest 50 lbs. soaking today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought if mycelium formed then the culture was healthy. If something happened after growth grew then a different factor made the extra mold grow. Basically that a contaminated culture couldn't grow white healthy myceluim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold is mycelium too, and you can't tell it in the early stages from mushroom mycelium.&amp;nbsp; There's no saving those 'good' jars with green mold in them.&amp;nbsp; Toss it all out and start over from scratch.&amp;nbsp; Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;grain prep video&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't already.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12557292</next>\n<prev>12556622</prev>\n<first>12548498</first>\n<last>12580050</last>\n<when>1273795703</when>\n<utime>05/14/10 03:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
