If a substrate is in the fruiting stages and a bit of green shows up, it should immediately be taken outside to finish up. The fruits will be safe to eat, but the green will contaminate your growing areas, so the jars need to be removed as soon as molds are spotted.   If you see green before fruits form, simply toss the whole jar out.  If you want to save the jar itself, pc it for an hour or two before opening.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4733165</next>\n<prev>4405033</prev>\n<first>4405033</first>\n<last>4737564</last>\n<when>1121392355</when>\n<utime>07/15/05 04:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
