That way you won't let all the heat out when you open the doors to enter and the deeper bit of ground back there can serve as additional insulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's actually the reason I did it the other way around though.&amp;nbsp; I was more concerned with keeping the fruiting end at 55F, thus it went in the back and is uninsulated, except for the roof.&amp;nbsp; I didn't want to open the door in the summer and heat up the fruiting area, or in the winter and freeze it.&amp;nbsp; Substrates during colonization are in large filter patch bags and somewhat better protected.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the natural flow of substrate is from my sterilization area/lab which is in the house, so the first room to be entered is where the substrates should go.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, I'd be walking through the fruiting area every time I brought substrate blocks in to colonize.&amp;nbsp; As for insulation, the incubation area is heavily insulated with Dow styrofoam sheets that are tough enough to be direct buried without collapsing and losing their R factor.&amp;nbsp; It will have an insulated door, and an arctic type entrance with a second door, so hopefully I don't lose too much heat in the winter when I enter and exit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm no longer interested in actives.&amp;nbsp; Call it old age. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10429533</next>\n<prev>10428582</prev>\n<first>10413482</first>\n<last>10445761</last>\n<when>1243775887</when>\n<utime>05/31/09 04:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
