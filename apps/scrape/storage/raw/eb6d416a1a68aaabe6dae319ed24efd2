The jug can hang from a wire if the whole tub is covered with substrate.   Don't put the ice on the outside or you'll stunt the mycelium in that location.  You can open fruiting chambers whenever you want.  The more the better in fact as long as you maintain humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5712375</next>\n<prev>5684384</prev>\n<first>5650534</first>\n<last>5730986</last>\n<when>1148869052</when>\n<utime>05/29/06 05:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
