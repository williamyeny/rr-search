Both will get you from point A to point B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've made many trials with both, and probably am guilty of starting this whole un-cased bulk sub thing.   There is little doubt that a properly made and hydrated casing layer can provide benefits to the flush.  The question becomes 'how much' benefit does a casing layer provide to home growers who can dote over their crops, misting and injecting water into the bulk, and soaking between flushes.   For those of us who have to leave for work all day, a casing layer is really a necessity for best results.  If an uncased substrate dries out, it's going to impact performance much more so than if a casing layer dries out for a few hours.   However, if the uncased substrate can be kept at optimum moisture and humidity, adding a casing layer is of marginal benefit.  One must also weigh the benefit of the casing layer against the added week to ten days the casing run takes.   It's something to experiment and play around with, but certainly nothing to get panties in a knot over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bra pics were just an attempt to inject a bit of humor into a tense situation.  Most of you have seen those pictures many times.  Well, not the bra wrapped around the bucket.  That was to enspire you guys to try something new and perhaps give an idea or two how to get started.  Weird grows are fun, even if they're not an effecient method of producing mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to see everyone get along, that's the main thing.  Life is too short for pissing matches between friends.
