I lay them out in the sun to dry so they won't mold before I use them.  Kiln drying won't hurt.  I've even sawed up hardwood lumber and plywood to use as substrate, both of which are kiln dried.  The mycelium loves it, especially the plywood.  The mycelium rips between the sheets, eating the glue first(which is water based and non-toxic), and then moves into the wood itself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6888103</next>\n<prev>6883830</prev>\n<first>6878602</first>\n<last>6888103</last>\n<when>1178551986</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
