Just my opinion, but otherwise, what i've seen of it, it's great! I really can't fathom that there is anything on that video, that couldn't be learned via simple research here though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must not have seen it.  I go into detail in the g2g and agar sections on how sterile one must be.  There is not room for error, and that's made very clear.  What is also made clear is many people waste time trying to be sterile when they don't need to be, such as spawning straw.  I demonstrate building the exact laundry basket pictured on the cover, on my far from sterile kitchen floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the props guys.  That screen shot doesn't do the picture of trich justice.  Here's the actual picture used.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/255718132-jar_contaminants_001a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-009/255718132-thumb_jar_contaminants_001a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7003218</next>\n<prev>7003043</prev>\n<first>7002007</first>\n<last>7014948</last>\n<when>1180893548</when>\n<utime>06/03/07 08:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
