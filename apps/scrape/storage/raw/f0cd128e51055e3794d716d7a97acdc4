(unlike verm).. maybe that would change things but i honestly think the mycelia would just colonize it over time. it looks good so far though! &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/cheers.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:cheers:&quot; title=&quot;:cheers:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir and verm both have nutrients the fungi can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have been casing with coir or using it as a bulk substrate for many years.&amp;nbsp; Rolling in verm has shown to be more dependable with cakes than coir.&amp;nbsp; Most of us break the cakes up and spawn to coir for better performance.&amp;nbsp; What you have should perform OK though.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20078459</next>\n<prev>20076320</prev>\n<first>20061106</first>\n<last>20087734</last>\n<when>1401797152</when>\n<utime>06/03/14 03:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
