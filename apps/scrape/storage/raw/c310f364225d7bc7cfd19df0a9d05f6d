You wanna introduce the humidity from the top, and let it work its way down. Best bet is to some how modify your humidifier to sit on the outside, with a tube running from it, into the Martha &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boris, that is absolutely wrong.&amp;nbsp; I have for many years measured humidity in my greenhouses and it's always higher at the top and lower at the bottom.&amp;nbsp; Humidity does not fall by gravity to the bottom.&amp;nbsp; Vapor is a gas, not a solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;herbie, In the first sentence, you refer to mushrooms on your 'spawn' and in the next you refer to substrate depth.&amp;nbsp; Which is it?&amp;nbsp; Spawn is your inoculant grains, and substrate is your manure, coir or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, your mushrooms are proportioned correctly, so FAE is not the problem.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom size is generally related to substrate depth and/or moisture content, so my guess is your substrate is either not thick enough, or is too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend placing the coolmist inside the greenhouse, and then cutting slits and windows in the plastic to allow for natural air circulation to provide the fresh air.&amp;nbsp; If you're using a&amp;nbsp; Kaz or Vicks coolmist humidifier, remove the filter and you'll get much more volume of air, thus more moisture output.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9091157</next>\n<prev>9091132</prev>\n<first>9090773</first>\n<last>9091206</last>\n<when>1224262220</when>\n<utime>10/17/08 07:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
