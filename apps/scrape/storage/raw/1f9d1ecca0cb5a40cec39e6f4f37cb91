Tyvek is a brand name, and housewrap is not going to provide the gas exchange you need for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, don't link to non-vendor sources for products that shroomery vendors carry. That is a very old rule around here. Furthermore, don't link from here to provide a way to misuse government property. Search for tyvek in the sponsor forum.  In addition, anyone ordering &quot;Let's Grow Mushrooms&quot; DVD can reply to the order confirmation with the word 'tyvek', and your order will ship in a tyvek envelope via priority mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for removing that second link roadkill.  I was working on it last night when shroomery went into 'backup' mode, cutting off access.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7939084</next>\n<prev>7929075</prev>\n<first>7927610</first>\n<last>7939227</last>\n<when>1201285852</when>\n<utime>01/25/08 08:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
