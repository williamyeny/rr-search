This totally is new to me. I know what agar is, but that's about the extent of my knowledge. I was also considering trying cyans, but I want to stay as close to my current method as possible. Staying with cubes would probably be better for me right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't order isolates but you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Strain-Isolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;isolate strains on agar&lt;/a&gt;, and then test each one with brf cakes.&amp;nbsp; Once you find the best performing strains, you save master slants and then you grow those isolates forever with guaranteed potency.&amp;nbsp; Growing from spores is like a family with ten kids: They'll have a fat one or two, a skinny one or two, a smart one, a few dumb ones, a criminal, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17860442</next>\n<prev>17860262</prev>\n<first>17857239</first>\n<last>17861750</last>\n<when>1361765432</when>\n<utime>02/25/13 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
