Only the spores are green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as for sterilizing verm, I do it when the bag has been opened for awhile.  If using a brand new bag, I usually don't bother.  It's easy to do by just putting the dry verm on a cookie sheet and baking in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7776604</prev>\n<first>7774624</first>\n<last>7776752</last>\n<when>1198078769</when>\n<utime>12/19/07 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
