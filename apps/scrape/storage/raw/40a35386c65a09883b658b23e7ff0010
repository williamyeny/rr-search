Keep the dishes in a vertical stack, and usually only the top one will have any condensation after a few days.  It also helps if you wait to pour the petri dishes until the agar has cooled enough that it starts to thicken.  You won't need heat protection for your hands at this point either.  This is the best way to avoid condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd get rid of the incubator as well.  Let them grow at normal room temp.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7297344</next>\n<prev>7295135</prev>\n<first>7293556</first>\n<last>7367317</last>\n<when>1187145231</when>\n<utime>08/15/07 05:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
