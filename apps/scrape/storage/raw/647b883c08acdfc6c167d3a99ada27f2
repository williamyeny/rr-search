Great advice, thats actually the one I've followed. But he doesn't go into detail on how to dry the straw? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's because you're not supposed to dry the straw.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You drain it and then as soon as it cools, you use it dripping wet.&amp;nbsp; Leave holes in straw logs or the bottom of laundry baskets or other containers so the excess can drain out over the next two to three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also don't need to rinse the soap out.&amp;nbsp; If you soak for 24 hours, you can skip the soap.&amp;nbsp; If you're in a hurry and doing the two hour soak, use soap.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14231756</next>\n<prev>14231555</prev>\n<first>14231187</first>\n<last>14278546</last>\n<when>1301865622</when>\n<utime>04/04/11 12:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
