You won't heat that water above 100C, and if you think you can clean a microwave with bleach, you have no idea how the magnetron tube works, and the fact that it's in a chamber that can't be easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a microwave as a glovebox is like using your unflushed toilet as a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of new growers around here have tried and even bragged up microwave 'sterilization', but the funny thing is, NONE of them are saying to use a microwave a year or two later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few growers have successfully used a 'wave to 'pasteurize' substrates in a sealed bag, but even that is iffy, since it's so hard to control temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8364297</next>\n<prev>8364204</prev>\n<first>8361588</first>\n<last>8573967</last>\n<when>1209997057</when>\n<utime>05/05/08 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
