The black plastic you see is the blowout valve.  It will leak a bit as the PC comes up to pressure.  It will seal when you get 5 pounds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The procedure is to let steam vent from that nipple for five minutes or so, then put the weight on to allow pressure to build. when it reaches 15 lbs, turn the stove down to the minimum setting that will still maintain that 15 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5743359</next>\n<prev>5743259</prev>\n<first>5743089</first>\n<last>5744432</last>\n<when>1150163339</when>\n<utime>06/13/06 04:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
