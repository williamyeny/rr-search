Just munch a quarter pound of dry mushies and see what happens, first or tenth flush.

It's the nature of the beast and there's nothing you can do to change it.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6344151</prev>\n<first>6339748</first>\n<last>6344180</last>\n<when>1165515718</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
