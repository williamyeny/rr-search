If you have no filter, bacteria can easily enter from the air currents and contaminate your grow.  If you can post a picture, I'll see if I can identify if bacillus is present.  If you don't have a camera, see if the grains are 'greasy' where they contact the glass surface.  Many people think if they see 'wet' where the grains touch it's bad, but that's normal.  Wetspot bacteria has a greasy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5753287</next>\n<prev>5753167</prev>\n<first>5753167</first>\n<last>5753287</last>\n<when>1150391724</when>\n<utime>06/15/06 08:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
