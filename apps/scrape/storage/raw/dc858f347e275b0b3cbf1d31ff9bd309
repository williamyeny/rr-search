The ballast inside produces high voltage and that doesn't mix well with high humidity.  you also don't want to heat your terrarium in any way.  If you do, it will drown in condensation.  You need to have your terrarium in a room that is 70+ for best results.  Look into a space heater for your room if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6527079</next>\n<prev>6527046</prev>\n<first>6527046</first>\n<last>6527167</last>\n<when>1170546365</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 01:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
