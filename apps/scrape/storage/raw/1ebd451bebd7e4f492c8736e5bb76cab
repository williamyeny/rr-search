My condo is full of the stuff, and I've been growing here successfully for years.  Run a heater and fan on it to dry the stuff out.  Once the wall is dry, the mold will die.  Bleach won't kill molds.  Look at your local home megacenter for a mold killing spray in the paint department.  Another alternative is to make a paste with water and hydrated lime, and apply that over the mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8126809</next>\n<prev>8125538</prev>\n<first>8123013</first>\n<last>8147300</last>\n<when>1205159865</when>\n<utime>03/10/08 05:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
