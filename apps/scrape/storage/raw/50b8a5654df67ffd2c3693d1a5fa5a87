If you live in a country where it's stronger than 3%, dilute with distilled water to get to that level, but in the US, the peroxide sold in drug and grocery stores is already 3%.  You need to wet the entire casing layer, and repeat three times at 8 to 12 hour intervals to wipe it out.  Don't wait for it to come back.  Hit it three times and it will be gone.  You'll see the mold melt and disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any green shows up, dispose of it outside in a manure or compost pile and it will recover if temperatures are right.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6940459</next>\n<prev>6940438</prev>\n<first>6940194</first>\n<last>6944977</last>\n<when>1179634678</when>\n<utime>05/20/07 07:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
