My question is &quot;Will I see an increase in pins going from say 60W Eq. CFL bulb to A 300W Eq. CFL?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping in mind the bulb would be the only thing changed, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good use for the larger bulb would be to set it farther back and light several tubs with the same one.&amp;nbsp; I have a few 35 watt 6500K CFLs in my grow room to fill in some of the dark areas left by the LEDs.&amp;nbsp; It makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying mushrooms don't use light the way plants do is really only partly correct.&amp;nbsp; They're different organisms, so yes they use light differently.&amp;nbsp; However, my wood stove uses logs to heat rather than electricity or gas, but the end result is my house gets warm.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms need and use light in their metabolism, even though it's a different process than plants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15427126</next>\n<prev>15427095</prev>\n<first>15426953</first>\n<last>15429760</last>\n<when>1322353104</when>\n<utime>11/27/11 02:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
