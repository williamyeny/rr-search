Fill that area with cow or horse manure.  Mix your colonized jars of mycelium into this and cover with 1 cm of soil or soil/peat mix.  Water well, but then allow to dry out pretty well between waterings.  Wait two months, and if your rainy season hasn't started yet, you can encourage fruiting by running a lawn sprinkler in the area for a couple of days.  Be sure to set up this patch in a shady, but well lit area.  The straw is good for a light mulch over the top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7748544</next>\n<prev>7748527</prev>\n<first>7748503</first>\n<last>24803266</last>\n<when>1197478334</when>\n<utime>12/12/07 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
