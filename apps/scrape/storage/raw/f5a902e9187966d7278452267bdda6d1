If you combined a hepa filter with a glovebox, that is very likely the problem.  Turbulence is a far greater concern than filtration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the syringe was contaminated, all the jars would have failed instead of most of them.  Another likely scenario is that the verm barrier on several of the jars shifted during transit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I've been making a lot of pf type cakes without the verm barrier.  Simply cover the inoculation holes with micropore tape, and then after inoculation, put a second piece of tape over the first.  This even lets you fill the jars a bit more with brf.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7823061</next>\n<prev>7822869</prev>\n<first>7822843</first>\n<last>7823179</last>\n<when>1199289791</when>\n<utime>01/02/08 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
