{"key":"post-15394901","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>15394901</id>\n<content>Walmart is the number 1 importer of worthless crap from china.&amp;nbsp; Their low prices make people who don't know any better buy a crappy product, and then six months later, they have to buy another crappy product because the first one has already shit the bed, and the process endlessly repeats, resulting in a horrible increase in the cost of living for us, while providing massive profits for them, and a siphoning of US funds to a Communist state with nukes pointed at us.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that were not enough, they've driven thousands of US manufacturers out of business due to chinese currency manipulation which walmart is a co-conspirator in, so those quality products which used to be produced in the US, employing US citizens, are no longer even available at any price.&amp;nbsp; Remember, each manufacturing job creates several additional jobs both in and outside of manufacturing.&amp;nbsp; At a time of huge unemployment, people who shop there are directly helping to keep the economy in the dumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, they pay barely over minimum wage, discriminate against their employees, have devastated small town Main streets across America, and fire anyone who attempts to join a union to better his or her position in life.&amp;nbsp; They're also one of the largest contributors to the Republican party, so people who value American jobs and American industry are supporting the opposition when they shop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boycott the ratty bastards before it's too late.&amp;nbsp; If I can grow mushrooms without ever having entered one of their stores since 1982, don't make the mistake of thinking you can't easily get your supplies somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15395636</next>\n<prev>15394731</prev>\n<first>15390049</first>\n<last>15397318</last>\n<when>1321756965</when>\n<utime>11/20/11 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
