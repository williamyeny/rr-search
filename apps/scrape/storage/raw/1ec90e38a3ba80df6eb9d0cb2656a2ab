Google it if you don't know what I mean.  They contaminate much easier.  Tap water is fine.  For crying out loud, we've had lots of threads where people have dunked cakes in ten percent bleach, so the very small amount in tap water isn't going to hurt anything.  Use tap, river, lake, spring, etc., but not distilled.  Save your distilled water for making agar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7939143</next>\n<prev>7939046</prev>\n<first>7938877</first>\n<last>8748147</last>\n<when>1201436615</when>\n<utime>01/27/08 02:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
