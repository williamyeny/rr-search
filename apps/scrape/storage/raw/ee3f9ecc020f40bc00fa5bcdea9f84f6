{"key":"post-6886190","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6886190</id>\n<content>Your welcome.  Worm castings tend to clump up like that so I use them as a supplement to manure, straw, coir, and coffee grinds.  If I have some compost, I throw that in as well.  The more things you put into your substrate, the better the mushrooms do.  Glad you were able to save it.  Let's hope it fruits well now.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6974726</next>\n<prev>6886135</prev>\n<first>6886135</first>\n<last>6974726</last>\n<when>1178590116</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 05:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
