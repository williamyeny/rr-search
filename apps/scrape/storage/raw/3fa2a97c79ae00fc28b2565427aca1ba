Of course not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you hear noobs saying such things as 'this or that' strain colonizes faster, is contamination resistant, more rhyzomorphic, etc., take it to mean they don't have a clue and are on their first or second grow.&amp;nbsp; Since every grow is different, new growers think the differences are in the name somebody wrote on the syringe, which is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10898891</next>\n<prev>10898776</prev>\n<first>10898374</first>\n<last>10898891</last>\n<when>1250807577</when>\n<utime>08/21/09 01:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
