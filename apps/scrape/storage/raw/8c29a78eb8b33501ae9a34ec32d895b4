Rip it into thin strips and soak in water.  Woodlovers love it.  The glue doesn't seem to hurt a thing.  The myc gobbles it up first.  I've had good luck using plywood, with the chunky coir mixed in to help fill the gaps.  It helps to add a bit of molassis or brown sugar to the water you soak the wood in.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3876805</next>\n<prev>3876771</prev>\n<first>3876385</first>\n<last>3877254</last>\n<when>1110130947</when>\n<utime>03/06/05 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
