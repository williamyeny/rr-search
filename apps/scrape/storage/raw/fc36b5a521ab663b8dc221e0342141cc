Perlite is for humidifying terrariums and/or adding air and fluff to casing layers, and vermiculite is for holding water as a reservoir and releasing it to the mycelium as needed.  Verm is used in pf cakes and casing recipes. It will also provide fluff and a rez effect(reservoir) in manure and compost mixes.
