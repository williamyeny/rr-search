Won't it absorb humidity? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we get to why you're having trouble.  In addition to shocking the mycelium with 32F water(a refrigerator is 45F) you have too little air exchange, and not near enough perlite to provide proper humidity.  Leave the lid loose or drill dozens of holes in all six sides of the terrarium for air exchange.  Add three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite.  Fluff the perlite up by raking your fingers through it every few days.  This will keep it evaporating water at a high enough rate to provide the humidity your mushrooms require.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7518219</prev>\n<first>7517575</first>\n<last>7518603</last>\n<when>1192456512</when>\n<utime>10/15/07 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
