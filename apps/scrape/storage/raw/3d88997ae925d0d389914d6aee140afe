It only works as a filter if it's bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your verm got wet, I'd bet it's because you didn't have the jars completely out of the water when you sterilized.&amp;nbsp; The jars need to be on a rack above the water so that when the water boils, it doesn't splash up and get inside.&amp;nbsp; The other thing that will get your verm damp is to leave the foil on after the PC cycle.&amp;nbsp; Always remove the foil when you remove the jars from the sterilization pot or PC.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10959370</next>\n<prev>10951412</prev>\n<first>10950489</first>\n<last>10959370</last>\n<when>1251475980</when>\n<utime>08/28/09 07:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
