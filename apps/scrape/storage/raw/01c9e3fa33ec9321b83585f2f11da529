For best results, use your spores to inoculate grains or brf cakes.  They will colonize faster than LC, and when finished, there is no guessing.  If they smell and look good, they are good.  At that time you can do a g2g to get the expanded amounts of mycelium you desire, or make fifty or more liquid mycelium syringes from each quart of colonized grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6791613</prev>\n<first>5894467</first>\n<last>6791902</last>\n<when>1176686325</when>\n<utime>04/16/07 04:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
