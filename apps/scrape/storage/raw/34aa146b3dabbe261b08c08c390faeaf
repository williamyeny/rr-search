They won't even read the posts from that day before asking something.  It seems there are too many kids who want people to take them by the hand and lead them all the way so there is no work on their part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that torques my ass is that like it or not, I'll never give the lazy or easiest way to do something.  This is a science and a hobby, so put out some effort and do it right.  If I can do twice the work for an extra ten percent, it's worth it. I get sick and tired of giving sound advice, then having somebody on their first or second grow come in and say, &quot;that's bullshit, I did such and such and it worked great! Only lost three jars out of ten&quot;  Well, news flash, if you lose three jars out of a hundred, you're doing something wrong.  Figure it out and quit trying to take the easy way.
