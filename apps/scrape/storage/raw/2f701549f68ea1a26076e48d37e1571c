CO2 is heavier then air, so in the case of a monotub with the holes taped up you would assume the CO2 would pool up and the levels would rise to high?&amp;nbsp; Without FAE, how is the CO2 physically removed from the propagation chamber to keep levels in check?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CO2 doesn't settle to the bottom as if it were water.&amp;nbsp; The CO2 mixes with the air and goes wherever the air goes.&amp;nbsp; There are always air currents to a certain extent in a tub caused by heat from the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17752950</next>\n<prev>17752328</prev>\n<first>17746975</first>\n<last>17760219</last>\n<when>1360126407</when>\n<utime>02/06/13 06:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
