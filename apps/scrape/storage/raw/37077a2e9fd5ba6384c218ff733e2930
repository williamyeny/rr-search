You should be able to keep your casing closed up for a week to colonize without getting cobweb.  Too low, or too hot a pasteurization temp will result in less resistance to molds, as will too high an incubation temp.  Don't go over 80F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Agar said, spray with peroxide. You can use the 3% peroxide full strength in your mister.  Cobweb spreads when you disturb it, so don't try to dig it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5471368</next>\n<prev>5470935</prev>\n<first>5470804</first>\n<last>5479576</last>\n<when>1144018002</when>\n<utime>04/03/06 01:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
