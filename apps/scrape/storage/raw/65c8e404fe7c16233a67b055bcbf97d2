This is my first post, and I just wanted to say that I use brown rice as well and to achieve a good, uniform moisture content you can just cook it in a rice cooker. It cooks the rice until no extra moisture is present then it automatically shuts off. But anyway, I was wondering if you guys think this jar of brown rice is ready to case. It's amazon strain, and was inoculated on 1/30/09. I know it's close, but some people say wait till all you can see is white. Thanks in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-007/449677636-SSPX0024.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/09-007/449677636-thumb_SSPX0024.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That jar looks wonderful! That is brown rice? I am thinking of doing a BR/WBS/Rye jar and seeing how that goes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I the only one that sees pink all over that jar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bag of whole brown rice as a substitute when I can't get to Seattle to pick up rye berries.&amp;nbsp;  If it wasn't four times the price of rye, it would be a good grain to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9797376</next>\n<prev>9797219</prev>\n<first>9613035</first>\n<last>10221130</last>\n<when>1234662931</when>\n<utime>02/15/09 03:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
