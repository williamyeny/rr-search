The problem with sodium bicarbonate is the sodium.  Salt is what is toxic.  Some commercial growers use sodium barcobonate to cover molds in order to get a woodchip/sawdust block to harvest.  However, plain salt works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum is not used to raise pH.  It's used to provide calcium and sulfur.  It also prevents pH from swinging in either direction, holding it where you originally set it with lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the label for hydrated lime.  Note the very low Mg content.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-29/352394956-hydrated_lime_label.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-29/352394956-thumb_hydrated_lime_label.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6977376</next>\n<prev>6976947</prev>\n<first>6973846</first>\n<last>6988952</last>\n<when>1180372170</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 08:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
