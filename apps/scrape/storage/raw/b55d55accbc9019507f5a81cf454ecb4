Although I'm not sure if the filter would clog up from the moisture before the mold grew or if the mold would appear first.  Either way, don't filter air to a fruiting chamber. It's not necessary. In addition, there is absolutely NO reason to filter air in a fruiting chamber.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, how would holes in the bottom 'push CO2 out'???  You seem to incorrectly think the CO2 is a separate entity, not thoroughly mixed with the air.  The way to get rid of the 'elevated' CO2 levels is through air exchange.  That's why we drill holes all over the FC and/or fan regularly.  CO2 will not drain out the bottom as if it were water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7939445</next>\n<prev>7939129</prev>\n<first>7936160</first>\n<last>7939739</last>\n<when>1201437571</when>\n<utime>01/27/08 02:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
