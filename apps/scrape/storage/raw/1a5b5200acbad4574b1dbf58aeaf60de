{"key":"post-5732256","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5732256</id>\n<content>During colonization of the casing layer, humidity is not relevant because the cased substrate should be enclosed in a tray with zero air exchanges per hour.  Cover with foil to achieve this.  Enough gasses will leak out around the edges of where you've sealed the foil around the tray.  It is not necessary to use a monotub for this stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you remove the foil and place in fruiting conditions, you want around the 90% range with cased substrates.  The casing will supply the humid microclimate to provide nearly 100% humidity right at the surface where the primordia form.  Once the fruits are growing, you can reduce to around 85%, but many growers keep it at 90%.  Be sure to allow plenty of air exchange once you expose to fruiting conditions.  Remember; full colonization, increased air exchange, light, and a steady rate of evaporation from the casing layer or substrate are all pinning triggers.  None is more important than any of the others. All must be adjusted in harmony for best performance.  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5732367</next>\n<prev>5732251</prev>\n<first>5730541</first>\n<last>5732367</last>\n<when>1149910285</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 06:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
