I had just saw the growth, and an hour later my landlord calls and says his going to be doing a bunch of work over here! I'll be damned, I fucking knew something would go wrong, and his wife just passed away about a year ago, so I bet he is going to be here all the time,I knew it! I have wanted to do this forever and now It probably won't, as long as I live here! Well maybe that was a sign, so I tried deleting out my journal to start fresh, but I just fucked that all up too! Well At least there is eddies!&amp;nbsp; I was so&amp;nbsp; Hyped, mycellium running on all plates, and now there trashed. Just my luck, well I guess things could be worse! Oh well, I got to let it go, as long as I am renting it seems, ain't that a bitch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're tossing out petri dishes because a landlord is coming over, perhaps a visit to a therapist is in order.&amp;nbsp; Paranoia will destroy ya.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19573666</next>\n<prev>19573311</prev>\n<first>19570972</first>\n<last>19573933</last>\n<when>1392559713</when>\n<utime>02/16/14 04:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
