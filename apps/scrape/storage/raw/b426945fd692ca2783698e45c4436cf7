Now its on the verge of snowing, and its cold! I need something that will give me light, and the heat i need, and the humidity...(the only way i can get the heat and such is if i use a bin and bin...and i cant put holes in that :/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been down below zero here for the last several mornings, with our high temp below freezing.&amp;nbsp; My shotgun terrariums are sitting at 75F and 97% humidity.&amp;nbsp; Are you saying you don't heat your house to normal room temp?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to avoid heating fruiting chambers.&amp;nbsp; The temp differential will cause loads of condensation to form on the walls, thus lowering the humidity inside.&amp;nbsp; If you need heat to obtain normal room temperature, use a small space heater in the room the terrarium is located, not the terrarium itself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11225675</next>\n<prev>11225289</prev>\n<first>11224282</first>\n<last>11226098</last>\n<when>1255274740</when>\n<utime>10/11/09 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
