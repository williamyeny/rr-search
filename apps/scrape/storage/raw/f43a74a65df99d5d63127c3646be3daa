{"key":"post-5043124","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5043124</id>\n<content>'Soil sweetener' is a generic term used for all lime.  Some are made for lawns and gardens and take all season to break down.  For a casing with a maximum life of a month or so anyway, you need fast acting lime.
