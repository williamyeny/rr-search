The lower humidity runs your humidfiers less, making them last longer.  It also helps to prevent condensation and puddles on the floor.  Pin initiation prefers a higher humidity, so I solve that by laying a sheet of wax paper over the top of the casing.  This holds near 100% humidity right on the top, then as the pins form, they push the wax paper out of the way, allowing more air to enter and the humidity to lower.  It's sort of a self regulating system.  Be sure to change the piece of wax paper out for a fresh one every second or third day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5146239</next>\n<prev>5145559</prev>\n<first>5138163</first>\n<last>5184727</last>\n<when>1136538204</when>\n<utime>01/06/06 11:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
