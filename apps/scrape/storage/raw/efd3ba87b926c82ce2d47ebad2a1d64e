End of story.&lt;br /&gt;I'll post pics of it fruiting MUSHROOMS in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;haters gonna hate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn't be attracting hostility from some members if you weren't looking at obviously contaminated substrate and calling it mushroom mycelium. It appears that rudeness is spawning more rudeness, and it needs to stop on both sides please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get at least one of these threads per month, so everybody has been here, done that, before.&amp;nbsp; Notice the leading edges of the white growth in your jars?&amp;nbsp; You'll see a distinct line between 'colonized' and 'uncolonized' areas.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With mushroom mycelium, there won't be a distinct line.&amp;nbsp; It will 'fade' into the uncolonized parts as it grows.&amp;nbsp; When you see that solid line, it's bacteria.&amp;nbsp; Another indication is the greasy appearance, sometimes described as 'melted ice cream'.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully, you now are aware you'll need to steam sterilize on your future projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also hopefully, this thread can again display civility.&amp;nbsp; We were all new once and needed folks to cut us some slack.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12524168</next>\n<prev>12524154</prev>\n<first>12498206</first>\n<last>12526349</last>\n<when>1273284687</when>\n<utime>05/08/10 05:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
