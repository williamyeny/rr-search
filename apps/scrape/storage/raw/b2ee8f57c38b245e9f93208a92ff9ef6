Remember, the very mycological definition of 'strain' is when two or more spores germinate and pair up 'sexually' to form dikaryotic mycelium.  It's a genetic roll of the dice when you use multispore inoculation.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's medeocre, and sometimes it's bunk.  Strain isolation is the key.  I'm sure you could do another set of jars from that very same syringe and they will be good. It's similar to a family with ten kids.
