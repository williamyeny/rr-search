Add a pot of coffee if desired.  A teaspoon of gypsum per gallon of soak water works to prevent clumping later.  I have never had grains soaking that spouted.  Perhaps it's the coffee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By starting with hot water, the grains absorb more moisture, and bacteria is encouraged to germinate and grow, which makes it easier to kill in the PC.  Also note the rinse is much more effective at removing dirt and chaff prior to the soak than after.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6390818</next>\n<prev>6389675</prev>\n<first>6388754</first>\n<last>6390818</last>\n<when>1166640040</when>\n<utime>12/20/06 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
