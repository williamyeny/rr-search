It's counter productive.   Since no print is 100% clean, the more spores you use, the more contaminats you inject as well.  Since molds and bacteria grow faster than mushroom mycelium, dark syringes give the advantage to contaminants over the mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The excess moisture you see is metabolic discharges from the mycelium trying to fight off the contaminants, and/or metabolites from the molds trying to fight off the mushroom mycelium.  Start over, and use a very light syringe, or better yet, prove your spores on agar, and transfer a proved, clean mycelium culture into your rye and watch it take off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6836029</prev>\n<first>6835872</first>\n<last>6836329</last>\n<when>1177604863</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
