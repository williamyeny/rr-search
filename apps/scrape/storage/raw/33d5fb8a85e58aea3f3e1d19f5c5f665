Multiple light mistings are superior to fewer heavy mistings. If you're really worried, run a cool mist in the room as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One possible cause is the tray is blocking the moisture from being able to evaporate off the perlite.&amp;nbsp; Raise the tray on shot glasses too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also 'rake' the damp perlite with your fingers to form ridges and valleys that will increase the surface area, thus increasing humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, don't cover holes if they're 1/4&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Simply mist to make up the difference.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9379723</next>\n<prev>9377702</prev>\n<first>9368106</first>\n<last>9380092</last>\n<when>1228578176</when>\n<utime>12/06/08 05:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
