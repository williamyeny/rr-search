I've accidentally left grains cooking for four to five hours at 20 psi and they were fine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours were too wet, thus water settled to the bottom, and in addition you filled the jars too full.&amp;nbsp; Next time, get the grains to the correct moisture level, and don't fill the jars more than 2/3 to at most 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13523288</next>\n<prev>13523082</prev>\n<first>13523059</first>\n<last>13523288</last>\n<when>1290442368</when>\n<utime>11/22/10 06:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
