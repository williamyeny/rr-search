Most will find it understanbale if you post your contamination problems in the cultivation section. Youll get a lot more replies as well and the posts dont really get removed for being in the &quot;wrong section&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I check that forum at least twice per day.&amp;nbsp; I really should move threads over there.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, I'm just too busy.&amp;nbsp; Contamination related posts should go there, and members can surf the threads there and 99 times out of 100 find their answer without posting.&amp;nbsp; There's only so many contaminants we have to deal with and every single one gets posted at least weekly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10825679</next>\n<prev>10825239</prev>\n<first>10824689</first>\n<last>10828508</last>\n<when>1249793220</when>\n<utime>08/09/09 07:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
