By definition that's growing hydroponically. It might or might not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not hydroponics.&amp;nbsp; Grains are solid food.&amp;nbsp; Grain dust suspended in water is solid food.&amp;nbsp; Many of us have seen small fruits forming on grain LC, and I've been posting pictures of fruits on agar for years, which is also solid food.&amp;nbsp; Sponge is solid food too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone takes a rockwool cube or similar synthetic substance(not vermiculite-it's solid food too) and places it in a chemical solution without grains, rice, etc., and grows a ten gram or larger mushroom on it I'll kiss their ass, because it would be akin to sending a human into space without a space suit or pressurized vessel.&amp;nbsp; It just ain't gonna happen.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who claims otherwise does not understand fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15724136</next>\n<prev>15724087</prev>\n<first>15720767</first>\n<last>16266296</last>\n<when>1327676943</when>\n<utime>01/27/12 05:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
