My quart sized grain jars from agar wedges or grain to grain transfers are fully colonized in ten days to two weeks at normal room temp of 72F to 77F, depending on time of day.  If it takes longer than that, something else is wrong.  Higher temps slow down mycelium growth while stimulating competitor molds and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8089941</next>\n<prev>8089830</prev>\n<first>8089243</first>\n<last>21064560</last>\n<when>1204403257</when>\n<utime>03/01/08 10:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
