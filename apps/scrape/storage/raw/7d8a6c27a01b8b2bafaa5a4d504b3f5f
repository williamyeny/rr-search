By that definition, all outdoor mushrooms would be toxic, yet they are not.   If our sterile culture becomes contaminated, the contamination might kill off our mycelium, but will be of little harm to us.  Eating mushrooms from a cake with green mold will NOT hurt anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we move to bulk substrates, we bring a bit of the outdoors inside by pasteurizing the substrate rather than sterilizing.  This allows many of the bacteria to survive, thus keeping the substrate alive.  If you sterilize bulk substrates, you make them more prone to contamination because a sterile substrate is a prime feeding ground for the first organism to land on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that helps clear things up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6586680</next>\n<prev>6586335</prev>\n<first>6586216</first>\n<last>6586680</last>\n<when>1171936513</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 03:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
