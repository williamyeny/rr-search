{"key":"post-6353934","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6353934</id>\n<content>I fold the tops of the bags accordion style, with a tyvek sleeve in each bag running the length of the folds.  By folding accordion style, as the bag expands it allows steam to escape, then when it cools, it retains it's shape and the tyvek sleeve filters any air that might enter the bag.  You can place a glass dinner plate on top of the bags to keep them from unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't fill the bags more than 1/2 full, regardless of the size bag.  You don't want it tidy and neat, except during the PC cycle.  Before sealing the bag after sterilization, be sure to inflate the top part with as much air as you can get into it from your laminar flow hood.  Personally, I use metal wire to tie the bags shut rather than impulse sealing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6354713</next>\n<prev>6353744</prev>\n<first>6353744</first>\n<last>6357874</last>\n<when>1165778896</when>\n<utime>12/10/06 09:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
