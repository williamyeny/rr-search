LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good plan.&amp;nbsp; Being around wild animals and tripping don't mix.&amp;nbsp; We've had a cougar around our cabin all week, and yesterday, we had a bear and her cub in our front yard stealing the apples off our tree. No way I'd want to confront either of them after eating mushrooms. My neighbor's rotweiller has a huge gash down his side from one of them. He's lucky to have survived. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going shaggy mane and bolete picking today, so you can bet we'll be carrying our pepper spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job on the monotubs too!&amp;nbsp; Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8886947</next>\n<prev>8886197</prev>\n<first>8861248</first>\n<last>8997668</last>\n<when>1220720675</when>\n<utime>09/06/08 08:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
