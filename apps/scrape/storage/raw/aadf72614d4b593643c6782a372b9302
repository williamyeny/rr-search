The best way is to drill a bunch of holes over time until your moisture content starts to drop then cover up the last holes you made. Of coarse this requires you to have a reliable hydrometer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never said such a thing.&amp;nbsp; If you make the terrarium by the tek, it will work properly.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is important, and if your cakes are drying out as they should, you mist to replace this lost moisture.&amp;nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrometers are not used in mycology.&amp;nbsp; You need an analog &lt;i&gt;hygrometer&lt;/i&gt; that can be calibrated by the damp towel method for measuring relative humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10293134</next>\n<prev>10292338</prev>\n<first>10291740</first>\n<last>10293188</last>\n<when>1241575845</when>\n<utime>05/06/09 05:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
