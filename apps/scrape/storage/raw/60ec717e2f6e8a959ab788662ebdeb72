{"key":"post-5989391","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5989391</id>\n<content>He wasn't 'raggin', and neither am I, but one must realize that for every person asking questions, there's a hundred people who don't post, but only lurk around and read to learn.  It's for those that we try to push in the right direction with the best possible procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's always corners to cut if one is happy with the results, but try telling a race car driver that it doesn't matter if his timing is off by only 1/2 degree.  He'll freak out, because nothing less than the best is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a fact that as mycelium colonizes a substrate, it acidifies that substrate.  Therefore, if you start out with a PH of 5, within a short time your ph will be down around 4.5 or so which definitely favors trichoderma and not mushroom mycelium.  Also, note that the effects of certain contaminants such as trich are cumulative, meaning that once you get them and they sporulate in your house/grow area, you'll have a much harder time avoiding them in the future.  Therefore the excuse that &quot;I haven't had contaminants yet&quot; should be an alarm bell to wake up and follow procedures before it's too late and the best of procedures won't be able to salvage a grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee grinds will measure at around 4 to 4.5 on the PH scale, so definitely need to be limed.  Adding gypsum helps in this regard as well, because it tends to stabilize ph, preventing swings in either direction.   Good luck to all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5989943</next>\n<prev>5989330</prev>\n<first>5985046</first>\n<last>6415198</last>\n<when>1156356506</when>\n<utime>08/23/06 09:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
