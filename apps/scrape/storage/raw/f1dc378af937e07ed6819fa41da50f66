It takes forever. Either the coir is just inherently resistant, or the bucket tek is keeping proper pasteurization temps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coir is inherently resistant, as I've posted here dozens of times.&amp;nbsp; I've left wet coir in a bucket in my shed for months without it ever molding.&amp;nbsp;  In fact, coir works without pasteurizing at all, but not as well.&amp;nbsp; I theorize the heat from pasteurization or boiling water 'cooks' it, making the substrate easier for the mycelium to digest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;anonjon said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when you argue that boiling water ruins the coir. It is not what I have observed. And if you really believe this, then why not shut down the Damion Coir tek thread as misinformation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't 'ruin' the coir.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I sterilize straw and coffee grinds when I add them to my sawdust blocks.&amp;nbsp; They are no more prone to contamination because I also keep them sterile until fully colonized.&amp;nbsp; What I said is that mixing manure, straw, or compost, etc., into the coir and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; adding boiling water is going to lead to an increased rate of contamination, as many growers here have found out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13888351</next>\n<prev>13887422</prev>\n<first>13870557</first>\n<last>13889630</last>\n<when>1296594611</when>\n<utime>02/01/11 11:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
