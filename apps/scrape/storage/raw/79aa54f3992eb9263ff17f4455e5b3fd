Think it was like called the Homestead Mushroom kit or something.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, it came with Agar, a petri dish, a test tube filled with birdseed, a sporeprint and a small spore scraper. The instructions were pretty complex back then, though reading through the forums now and watching RR's video makes it look like child's play.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, you had to make the agar, culture the spores on the agar, pressure cook your little (and I mean little) test tube of bird seed, then transfer some mycelium from the agar to the test tube.&amp;nbsp; Then you waited for that to colonize and then you would fruit this little test tube and maybe get 5 or 10 mushrooms if you were lucky. Needless to say, that turned me off growing mushrooms for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the old homestead kits.&amp;nbsp; They were the first real kits which actually worked if someone followed the directions.&amp;nbsp; They were in head shops everywhere in the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15879125</next>\n<prev>15876233</prev>\n<first>15874412</first>\n<last>15879125</last>\n<when>1330472625</when>\n<utime>02/29/12 01:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
