{"key":"post-6212413","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6212413</id>\n<content>Black pin mold(mucor), and Aspergillis niger, etc., are spawn and substrate contaminants, not mushroom contaminants.  You can pick fruits from a substrate with black mold(or any other mold) and eat away.  Won't hurt ya.   I toss out jars of mycelium that develop black, grey, green, red, etc., molds, but jars of grain spawn don't have mushrooms in them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6212349</prev>\n<first>6207504</first>\n<last>6212413</last>\n<when>1161835549</when>\n<utime>10/26/06 07:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
