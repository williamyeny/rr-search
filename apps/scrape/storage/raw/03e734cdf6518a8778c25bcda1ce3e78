When they get so rusty I'm afraid they won't seal, I discard and replace.  By seal, I mean I use metal side down, so the metal/glass interface is the seal.  If you use rubberside down, they can be a real pain to open because they stick.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to put a second filter in each lid.  I'm not sure one will be enough.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6587413</next>\n<prev>6587357</prev>\n<first>6214730</first>\n<last>26118311</last>\n<when>1171946365</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 06:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
