You'll find when you get to field moisture capacity, fifteen minutes later you squeeze and no water comes out.  Just add more water and repeat the process.  DE holds an enormous amount of water, which is great for substrates and casing material.  Just adding DE to your mix will give you larger fruits, provided you take time to get the moisture content correct.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5769765</next>\n<prev>5769577</prev>\n<first>5764759</first>\n<last>5769765</last>\n<when>1150770714</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 05:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
