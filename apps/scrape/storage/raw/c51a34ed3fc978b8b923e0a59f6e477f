Though, I'd like to improve my english and push it a little further. I'm not at ease with past tenses. I would say :&lt;br /&gt;I took&lt;br /&gt;I have taken&lt;br /&gt;I have had taken&lt;br /&gt;I had taken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much randomly. I take the one that sounds the best to my ears.&lt;br /&gt;I read a whole fucking lot in english, listen to all TV shows and movies in english. Every program and devices I have are set up to english mode. I guess I'll master english one day or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem.&amp;nbsp; You're doing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What pisses me off is people who grew up in the U.S., who speak no other language but 'English', yet they're totally retarded when it comes to forming coherent sentences.&amp;nbsp; I used to correct them, but now I simply ignore their posts because if they can't even master the only language they're ever heard or used, they're also too stupid to grow mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disregard the rudeness of people who can't recognize a person using a second language to communicate here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14955851</next>\n<prev>14955826</prev>\n<first>14954863</first>\n<last>14959334</last>\n<when>1313938813</when>\n<utime>08/21/11 06:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
