{"key":"post-5214054","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5214054</id>\n<content>I strongly disagree.  A mini greenhouse should have plenty of free air exchange to handle both at once.  I do it all the time.  I have had five or six different species growing at the same time for years now, including oysters.  A mini greenhouse is not a terrarium that stays closed up.  Leave the door cracked open a bit if you need for air exchange.  My mini-greenhouse has a 4&quot; clothes dryer hose running  through the wall to the outside for fresh air intake.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5282934</next>\n<prev>5213341</prev>\n<first>5209159</first>\n<last>5282934</last>\n<when>1138047601</when>\n<utime>01/23/06 10:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
