Don't toss it until you check in at the contamination forum and browse some pictures.  If it's mold, it will be a separate zone of mycelial growth, distinct from the mushroom mycelium. The mold spores are what are green/black/yellow/etc, and they'll be a separate layer on top of the mycelium, as if you sprinkled colored sand on the substrate. If it's bruising or metabolites, it will simply be a change in color, but no change in the structure of the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7401239</prev>\n<first>7401037</first>\n<last>7401281</last>\n<when>1189635605</when>\n<utime>09/13/07 01:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
