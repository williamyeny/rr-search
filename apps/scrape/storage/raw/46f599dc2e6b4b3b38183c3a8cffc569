The biggest reason is that since sterilization is a &lt;i&gt;relative&lt;/i&gt; term, it's never complete.  You have a window of opportunity to get your grains colonized before the contaminants that survived pressure cooking come back to haunt you.  If you grain to grain with uncolonized grains, you add their age to the age of all the grains in the receiving jar, possibly contaminating them all.  The difference between 100% colonization and 80% colonization should be no more than two days, so don't risk failure for for a measly 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7644768</prev>\n<first>7644738</first>\n<last>7645121</last>\n<when>1195259508</when>\n<utime>11/17/07 02:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
