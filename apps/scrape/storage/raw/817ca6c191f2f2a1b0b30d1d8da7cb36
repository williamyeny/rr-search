I've found the more different ingredients that make up a substrate, the healthier your crop will be.  I've had excellent results crumbling up corn cobs and mixing them in with my horse manure substrates.  A commercial oyster grower I know uses corn cobs along with coffee grinds from local restaurants as substrate.  It's all good.  Just get the moisture content right so it will colonize fast, and don't forget lime and gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5998958</next>\n<prev>5997462</prev>\n<first>5996115</first>\n<last>5998958</last>\n<when>1156566216</when>\n<utime>08/26/06 07:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
