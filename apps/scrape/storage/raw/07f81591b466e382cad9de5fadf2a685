Either your humidifier is set for too long a run time, or the temperature inside the greenhouse is warmer than the temperature outside.  If using coolmist(s), give them no longer than a few minutes of run time before shutting down to allow the air to absorb the moisture.  After a few minutes of 'off' time, set them to come back on.  That measure alone will prevent moisture buildup on the walls, trays and floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As creamcorn said, your tray is several days away from the fruiting chamber anyway, as you need to case, then cover with foil while the casing runs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5989203</next>\n<prev>5988853</prev>\n<first>5988850</first>\n<last>5989828</last>\n<when>1156342796</when>\n<utime>08/23/06 05:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
