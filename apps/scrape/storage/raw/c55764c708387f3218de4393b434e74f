Your batch of grass seed apparently had no bacterial endospores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye grass seed will not change the boiling poing of water to any noticable degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the interior of the jars ever reached 100C they would have been totally dry.  That is a fact of physics.  It's cool that you got some fruits..
