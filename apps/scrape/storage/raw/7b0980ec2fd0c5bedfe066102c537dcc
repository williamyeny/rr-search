The primordia really don't care if they're on a cake or cased substrate, so I always fail to see the reasoning behind the often repeated 'casings don't need a high RH', because they both will benefit from 99% humidity during the primordia formation stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to keep your humidity high as said above by laying a sheet of wax paper over the top of each tray.  This will keep the surface of the casing layer near 100% humidity, promoting pin development.  Don't forget to mist lightly a few times per day to keep the surface nice and moist.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7038667</prev>\n<first>7037055</first>\n<last>7039714</last>\n<when>1181706124</when>\n<utime>06/13/07 06:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
