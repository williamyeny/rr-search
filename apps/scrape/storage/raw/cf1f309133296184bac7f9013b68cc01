I got tired of replacing the $30 gauge every six months, and since I did the above, I've been running a cheapie gauge for several years now.&amp;nbsp; I can lay the back of my fingers on the nipple just ahead of the gauge and it isn't even hot during the PC cycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/forums/files/07-009/259775434-Lobster_night_1a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-009/259775434-thumb_Lobster_night_1a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9417593</next>\n<prev>9417387</prev>\n<first>9415535</first>\n<last>9435022</last>\n<when>1229105865</when>\n<utime>12/12/08 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
