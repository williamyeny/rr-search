I thought that even with the construction of this type of fruiting chamber they say to mist and fan a couple times a day anyway. If that is not correct please let me know because I am about 2 weeks away from birthing(probably). I guess the thing I am now wondering is, is the construction of this chamber suitable for leaving all day without any misting or fanning? And am I just maybe supposed to check it at the end of every day to see if the perlite is dry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan will screw it up.&amp;nbsp; The fact is, you don't even have to 'fan' a shotgun terrarium.&amp;nbsp; We recommend such after misting, but it's more for the turbulence(mold prevention) than fresh air which is always being exchanged in a shotgun terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a clear terrarium.&amp;nbsp; The colored ones will filter too much light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perlite gets rehydrated daily whenever you mist your cakes or trays.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>14831807</prev>\n<first>14826490</first>\n<last>14831850</last>\n<when>1311776662</when>\n<utime>07/27/11 05:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
