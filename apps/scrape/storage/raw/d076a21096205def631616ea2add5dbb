I've posted about this in the sponsors forum a few times already.&amp;nbsp; I'm trying to get a TV station to document the next classroom project.&amp;nbsp; The only problem is from our remote mountain location, we're a three hour drive from the nearest town with broadcast TV.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8996074</next>\n<prev>8995921</prev>\n<first>8994625</first>\n<last>8996357</last>\n<when>1222572537</when>\n<utime>09/28/08 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
