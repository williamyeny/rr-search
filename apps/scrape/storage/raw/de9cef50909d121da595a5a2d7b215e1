I swear to god if you ppl fuked up my grow bag by giving me Mixed adviced I'm gonna get pissed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave you proper advice.&amp;nbsp; I don't give a flying fuck if you're pissed or not.&amp;nbsp; If you can't understand simple procedures, then perhaps this hobby is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should mix your spawn bags or jars when they're 1/3 to 1/2 colonized in order to mix the colonized grains with the uncolonized.&amp;nbsp; I fail to see what's so complicated about that.&amp;nbsp; If you don't know the difference between kneading a sealed bag in your hands to mix the grains, and fruiting, then you have a lot of reading and study to do.&amp;nbsp; Chill the fuck out and spend a few days of reading and study, rather than trying to ask everything as you go along.&amp;nbsp; Nobody is going to stand here and hold your hand.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9658067</next>\n<prev>9658046</prev>\n<first>9657826</first>\n<last>9658615</last>\n<when>1232647158</when>\n<utime>01/22/09 07:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
