Start adding hoses and you suddenly have static pressure which forces the mist into the motor and motor bushings, which ruins them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can cut a hole in the side of the greenhouse and stick the output end of the humidfier right through it, but you won't get the high humidity you can get with it inside because with it inside, the humidfier pulls in air that is already humid, then adds more mist to that.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6156061</next>\n<prev>6153440</prev>\n<first>6153073</first>\n<last>6156061</last>\n<when>1160492536</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 06:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
