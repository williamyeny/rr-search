Earth tongue has one of the worst reputations in the business, second only to STP, the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strain is irrelevant in mushrooms, unlike in mj cultivation where it's everything. A cube IS a cube.  The long-time growers know this, thus the disreputable spore sellers constantly invent new names to stamp on the same old strains that have been around for years. Pick a strain from a shroomery vendor for your microscopy study.  Sporeprints easily slide into a regular mail envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it seems to be in vogue with the unreputable spore dealers lately to put charcoal into the syringes to make them appear very 'dark', thus fooling new growers into thinking they got a lot of spores.  Experienced growers know that less spores is better, thus they make light syringes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the constant cluttering of the board with worthless strain questions, we had to make a 'strain thread' and it's stickied at the top of the page.  All discussion of 'strains' needs to be done up there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7887490</prev>\n<first>7887137</first>\n<last>7887553</last>\n<when>1200497836</when>\n<utime>01/16/08 05:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
