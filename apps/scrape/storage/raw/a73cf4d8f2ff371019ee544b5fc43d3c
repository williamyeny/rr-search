If you don't, sometimes contaminants will settle on the top verm layer, and then your needle will push them through to the substrate below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always flame sterilize needles and other tools between jars.  This eliminates the possibility of cross contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves and wash them with alcohol after putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear a surgical mask and don't talk while working.  The spit that leaves your mouth when you talk will easily penetrate even a surgical mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work in a small closed room with no drafts.  Use oust to sanitize the air itself, and alcohol or Lysol to sanitize surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said, get your first few syringes from a reputable source.  With a bit of experience, you'll be making your own in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6650022</prev>\n<first>6649719</first>\n<last>6651183</last>\n<when>1173420172</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 08:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
