Allow the water to run gently for an hour or two over the edge of the tray and down the drain.  The running water will protect against bacteria buildup during the dunk, so no need for the refrigerator which is usually too dirty with molds from veggies and fruits to put an open container in.  The refrigerator is fine for dunking cakes in sealed jars, but keep your bulk trays out unless you have a dedicated lab fridge that never sees food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5653110</prev>\n<first>5653076</first>\n<last>5653113</last>\n<when>1148147780</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 08:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
