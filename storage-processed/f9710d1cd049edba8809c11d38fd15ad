I only wanted a time-lapse movie of a petri dish colonizing, but the darn lid kept fogging up with condensation from the bright lights needed for photography. The cure was to remove the parafilm from the edges of the petri dish.  That allowed the contaminant to slip in under the edge.  Both the contaminant and the Reshi have started to grow again.  After 48 hours of staring each other down, I noticed this morning the green had expanded 1mm toward the reishi.  Within two hours, the reshi had jumped 2mm toward the contaminant.  I'll post pix when I get back to my other computer where the video captures are being saved. It would appear the battle is about to begin.  Two video cameras on tripods are recording every activity in this dish 24/7.  I can't wait to see the outcome.<br />RR<br />RR","title":"Re: Clash of the Titans"}}
