You're more likely to get molds indoors because it was far from sterile.  That's how I grew my first mushroom crop ever back in 1971, which got me started.  That was before there was any books, kits or anything, and of course, no internet.  I brought home a cow patty from a field in east texas to where I lived at the time in Dallas, and stuck it into some compost.  That compost pile produced hundreds of mushrooms that whole year.<br />RR"}}
