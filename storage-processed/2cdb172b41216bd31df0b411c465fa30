They aren't plants.&nbsp; :p<br />I cringe when I see mushy growers using HPS or MH lights though. Or spending any additional money on obtaining special lights.&nbsp; Any light works as long as it is not too hot.&nbsp; Mushies tend to prefer shaded growth even in the wild.&nbsp; No need to mimic the sun. Just a lil light will do.</blockquote><br />This is just flat-out wrong, and not based on fact other than the part about mushrooms not being plants.<br />This is not even a controversy.&nbsp; Too many mushroom farms have put in bright LED strings or 6500K fluorescent lamps after reading about work done at Mountain Mushroom Farm. Fungi Perfecti also now <i>colonizes and fruits</i> substrates exposed to 6500K light for 12 hours per day from start to finish. All have reported increases in yield far beyond the costs of the lights or electricity.<br />In fact, I ran some tests several years ago with 400 watt MH lamps with a color temperature of 4500K.&nbsp; Yields were well above what was achieved with fluorescent lamps.&nbsp; More research is needed to find the upper limit of effectiveness as far as brightness is concerned.&nbsp; Full spectrum works better than any individual frequency.<br />As I've said for years, some mushrooms will grow in total darkness, just not well.&nbsp; Furthermore, since most of the members around here have never grown anything but cubes, it should be noted they rarely grow in the shade.&nbsp; I've picked thousands of pounds of wild cubes from the very middle of cow pastures in Texas without anything but a few blades of grass for shade.<br />RR"}}
