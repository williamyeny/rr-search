You'll be able to grow some monsters on straw logs.  The key to success with straw is not to let your pasteurization temperature exceed 160Fto 170F. If you can keep it in the 145F To 155F range, the beneficial bacteria that survive help to make the straw very contaminant resistant.  I have several straw logs going right now with oyster mushrooms.  I'll have some pictures up in a couple of weeks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about straw logs"}}
