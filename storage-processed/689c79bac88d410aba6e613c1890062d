That's the sequence I worked out with my vics cool mist and a greenhouse that is easily as large as three marthas.  I get humidity in the mid 90's with zero drips or mess.  Not only that, the coolmist has been running for well over a year now.  When using hoses, max life was measured in weeks.  In addition, I only need to fill the thing once every ten days or so.  Placing the coolmist INSIDE the greenhouse is key.<br />RR","title":"Re: FC Humidity Q"}}
