You only need to shake once at 20% to 30% colonization.  Your second and fourth jar above look about done.  Give them a few days past full colonization before spawning to bulk.  The third jar needs a few days.  They'll all look like the first jar after shaking.  That's normal.  Shake just before spawning by banging the jar against a tire, and then layer into your manure or whatever you're using as bulk.  The mycelium on the grains will recover right into the substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: rye jar problem - plz help UPDATE! PICS"}}
