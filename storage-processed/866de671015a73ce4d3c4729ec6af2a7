The more water on top of them = more pressure = more water getting absorbed. That's just how I do it. Always made since to me... I never let them float or be out of the water or anything.</blockquote><br />This is what I do.&nbsp; The extra pressure hydrates the cakes faster.&nbsp; You can tell from the weight when they're finished.&nbsp; Be sure to rinse the cakes under the faucet after removing from the soak water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this dunk proper?
