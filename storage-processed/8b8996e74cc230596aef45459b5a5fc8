I could be wrong about how much it might of gotten exposed to 100% humidity outside. I could also argue that pinning did not start when expected due to being too wet during my tweaking. </blockquote><br />In most areas, the humidity goes to near 100% at night and early morning.&nbsp; Also, a day/night temperature change is a MAJOR pinning trigger that most indoor growers don't take advantage of.<br />You are correct.&nbsp; A too-wet substrate will not pin.&nbsp; It's also more likely to get moldy, so you got lucky.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fresh air and Green molds"}}
