I make substrates on the dry side so they colonize faster, and then dunk before first flush.  A two inch substrate and 1/2\" casing layer should be plenty to get nice sized fruits.<br />I didn't show the use of coffee in the video because it's optional anyway, and I was afraid people would use too much, which actually slows down colonization.  Better safe than sorry.  I had it all filmed with coffee, and then decided to film that segment over again without it.<br />RR","title":"Re: RR video rye grain tek"}}
