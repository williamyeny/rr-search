Use 4 mil.  If you use less than 4 mil thickness, it will rip when you stuff the straw in.  Using the link above as a reference, the 4 mil, 14\" width will cost you $87.29 for a 1075 foot roll.<br />You could go with the 18\" width, at $113.86 per roll, to make an 11.5\" diameter log.  I wouldn't go thicker than that.  The 16\" width will give you a log 10\" in diameter.  The straw log shown in my video is 10\" in diameter.<br />Graingers is a bit cheaper if you have one in your area and have a business license.  You can get small lengths from fungi perfect, but the price is double the above, or more.<br />RR"}}
