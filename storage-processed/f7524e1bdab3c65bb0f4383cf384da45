What I've seen happen is if the jars sit out, the dry verm gets some contaminant spores on it through the holes, then when you inoculate, your needle pushes the contaminants through the verm and into the substrate.<br />This has happened to me several times, but only on jars I didn't cover with micropore tape.   The taped jars have been fine.   Just a tip.<br />RR","title":"Re: keeping sterile"}}
