I just object to tek bashing, because each has its place. They're all good.  My pf jars are usually fully colonized in two weeks. Ditto for Roadkill. Other growers often need three because they don't get the moisture right, but many rye and wbs growers also don't get the moisture right at first.  It's all a learning curve.  <br />In addition, once you grow your rye, you still have to either case it or spawn to bulk.  An experienced cultivator can get fruits from spores or LC quicker with pf cakes than with rye.  That's a fact.  I had been growing for many years before pf put his first ad in high times.  I remember the issue well, and was thinking wtf???  Nobody was using syringes at the time for inoculations, and I remember thinking this is going to destroy the 'art' of cultivation by making it possible for everybody to grow, without having to learn to use agar.  Now just look.  Even the pf tek bashers are using spore syringes.  They use his tek while bashing it.  <br />I just ask an open mind and don't mislead the noobs.  The brf tek is a great way to start, and many long term growers still use it.  My next DVD on recycling with mushrooms uses nothing but brf cakes as spawn to newspapers, phone books, cardboard, etc., for one reason.  They work.  They don't require a pressure cooker, and with blunt tip syringes, edible cultures can be made available to schools and parents to teach their children to grow mushrooms.  Give credit where credit is due.<br />RR"}}
