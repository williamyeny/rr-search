Mushrooms are far more closely related to animals than plants.<br />Coir is a substrate material, not casing.  If used in a casing, it needs to be heavily diluted with vermiculite.<br />Verm is not necessary for a good casing layer.  Peat, buffered with calcium carbonate or oyster shell flour was the standard for many years.  Vermiculite helps but is not mandatory.<br />RR"}}
