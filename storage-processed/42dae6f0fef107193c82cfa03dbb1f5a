Sort the mushrooms and toss out the substrate/grains.  If using brf, just 'birth' and cut the mushies out the same way, then toss out what's left and start a new jar.  Invitro is very easy, but certainly not the way to get maximum yields.<br />There is no need to use foil with invitro growing.  In fact, if you're trying to keep light off, foil actually reflects light down the length of the glass, increasing light exposure.  It's not necessary however.  Light is extremely overrated as a pinning trigger anyway.  Other factors are as much or more important.<br />RR"}}
