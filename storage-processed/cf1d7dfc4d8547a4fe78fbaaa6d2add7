In other words, if you're using a jar, treat it like a grain jar.  I use a whiskey bottle with a filter in the lid for agar because it's easier to pour.<br />Pour the dishes after the agar has cooled, but before it's solidified.  I wait until I don't need an insulated glove or pot holder to protect my hands from the heat.  This will prevent condensation.  Pour the dishes in a vertical stack, and then slip the sleeve back over them as protection while they cool.<br />RR","title":"Re: First-timer making petri dishes"}}
