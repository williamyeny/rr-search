You really need to learn to focus the camera.  What I see looks like a blurry picture of pins.  Try using a tripod or putting the camera on a book or something.  <br />The 'box' in the center of your viewer is the part that is going to be in focus if it's in automatic mode, so don't put what you're trying to show at the bottom.  The back of the picture is in focus, but the bottom is not.  Put the object in question in the viewers box.<br />RR"}}
