A layer of substrate, followed by a layer of spawn, etc.  You don't want any of the wbs or other grains left on the surface.  Make sure there's a layer of compost/manure over all of the top layer of grains.  Some growers mix the spawn thoroughly into the compost and that works too.  I've done it both ways and prefer the former.<br />Plain vermiculite is a very poor choice of casing material.  I'd look into peat/verm for better performance.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ahg, a new bee bulk substrate question"}}
