They're too thin and will tear easily when it comes time to shake to distribute the mycelium.  In addition, by the time you go to the effort and expense of making a proper filter, you'll have spent nearly as much as the proper bags cost, which is about 40 cents if you'll order 100 at a time.   Order filter patch bags from a mycology supplier.<br />RR"}}
