Also, in the link roadkill posted above I should have said I 'rarely' use a casing layer with horse manure instead of saying 'never'.  Certain species such as pans really need a casing layer to fruit properly, and of course cubes will get much bigger with the added moisture of a casing layer.<br />Also, the wax paper won't supply moisture to your substrate the way a casing layer will.  It only prevents excessive moisture loss and as said, provides a humid microclimate.  Perhaps the best of both worlds is to use a thin casing layer along with a sheet of wax paper laying on top.  Sorry for the confusion.<br />RR"}}
