This means any of us would probably die of old age before perfecting a 'strain' this way and is why experienced growers perform thousands of strain isolations and do their genetic work with isolated dikaryotic strains, not spores.<br />No, I didn't take offense to your comment.&nbsp; Questioning procedures is how we learn.&nbsp; However, I'm not going to go into detail on an imperfect method when there's far more effective ones.&nbsp; It would be like going to an online car forum and demanding an experienced mechanic detail exactly how you'd design a car with square wheels, simply because that's what you've made up your mind you want to do.<br />RR","title":"Re: Breeding with monokaryons and breeding through brute force (moved)"}}
