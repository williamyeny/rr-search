The more water in the PC the better with agar because it makes it cool slower.  If you need 500 ml of agar, you need a 1 liter flask.  It's important to have lots of room above the agar.<br />Don't let the weight rattle four times per minute with agar or it will boil over during the cooking cycle.  Adjust the stove so the weight doesn't rattle at all, but you still have 14.5 psi.<br />RR"}}
