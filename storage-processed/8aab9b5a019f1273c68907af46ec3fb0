That is not only a very dangerous fire hazard, but it will burn up the motor in short order.  AC motor speed is controlled by the frequency, which in the US is 60 hz, and in most of Europe is 50 hz.  AC motors are not controlled by current, which should be steady.  In addition, it's a violation of the National Electrical Code to use them for motor control, so any licensed electrician that hooks one up would lose his license for sure.  In fact, an electrician was charged with 2nd degree murder in New York recently for hooking up a ceiling fan to a lighting dimmer, which then caused a fire that killed two children.  NEVER do it please.<br />RR","title":"Re: How would I reduce the speed of a 12VAC 3AMP fan for my humidifier?"}}
