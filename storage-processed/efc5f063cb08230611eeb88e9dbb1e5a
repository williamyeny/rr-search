The 'omc' definitions of strain are actually incorrect from a mycology standpoint.  There is just as much variation within a single sporeprint, as there is between sporeprints from opposite sides of the planet.  Mixing strains won't hurt a thing.  If you doubt this, instead of using 2cc's per jar from a single syringe, try using 1cc each from two different syringes.  As controls, inoculate a few jars in the traditional manner.  Mix the jars up on your shelf or incubator without labeling which ones are which strain, and I'll bet a dollar when they fruit, you won't be able to tell the difference between the single 'strain' jars and the dual 'strain' jars.
