By digesting more food before fruiting, better quality fruits are produced. Other than that, there are no known ways to readily increase potency in substrates.  There's lots of talk about tryptamines, etc., but the claims of increased potency can't be independently repeated.  I believe from my many experiments with hundreds of substrates and additives that potency is genetic.  If your mycelium has enough food to produce mushrooms, it has enough food to produce the active ingredients as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: higher potency and over-colonized jars"}}
