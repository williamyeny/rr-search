You really should have three to five inches of rinsed, but well drained perlite with no standing water.  That will give you 99% humidity and prevent your cakes from drying out on you.  Fruit size is mostly related to moisture content, so if humidity is low, the cake dries out more.<br />If necessary, you can use a syringe to inject three or four ml into the center of the cake every couple of days.  Next time, I'd suggest a dunk and roll before the flush as well.  The verm on the side and top of the cake helps to absorb moisture when you mist, holding it in place long enough for the mycelium to absorb and use.<br />You can let that biggest one grow another day.  Pick anytime between now and when the veil finishes tearing for best fruit quality, or when the cap flattens out if you want it for sporeprinting.<br />RR"}}
