The only one that could possibly be suitable is the 12\" model, their <i>largest</i>.  It's rated at 655 CFM at 1\" of static pressure, and costs $350.  You can get a suitable squirrel cage blower at Graingers for less than half that.<br />You CAN NOT use a lighting dimmer to control an inductive load.  Such is an extreme fire hazard, a violation of article 430 of the National Electrical Code, and guaranteed to burn out any motor under load in a very short time.  To control motors, you need a motor speed controller.  They come in both voltage and frequency control styles.<br />An 18 X 24 filter will require at least 750 CFM at 1\" WC to work properly.  You have 3 square feet of surface area.  To get an airspeed of 100 feet per minute(the very minimum that will work) leaving the filter, you'd have to have 300 CFM delivered with no loss.   Such is impossible.  There is resistance causing loss as the air leaves the blower.  There is resistance causing loss as the air makes the turn into the plenum.  There is resistance causing loss as the air pressurizes the plenum, and there are losses introduced by resistance as the air travels through the filter.  Thus, a 300 cfm blower will not deliver 300 cfm after all that.<br />I use a 12 X 24 flowhood with a 650 CFM blower and it's barely enough. The airspeed leaving my flowhood has been measured at 118 lineal feet per minute.  I doubt seriously that would be able to deliver the minimum 100 feet per minute with the 20% more surface area of your filter.<br />RR<br />edited to fix typos"}}
