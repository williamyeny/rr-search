In fact, that cake looks about ready to birth anyway.  I'd birth, dunk and roll, and then place into fruiting conditions.  Don't bother picking that fruit off, as it will probably survive.  If it aborts, you can always pick it off later.<br />One possible cause is drilling too large of holes in the lid.  If so, they provide too much air exchange, which can lead to early pinning.  If you used four needle sized holes, then that isn't the 'problem', but a natural occurrence.  Good luck and congrats on your first fruit!<br />RR"}}
