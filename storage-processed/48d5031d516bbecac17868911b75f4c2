Fix those three things and try again.  Also, this isn't OTD so edit your thread title before you post again, or I will.<br />Next time, rather than ranting, try giving a bit more information about the grow.  Substrate depth and pH is important. Casing layer makeup, pH and depth, and air exchange provisions are also important.  I don't personally use the monotub tek, but others have had great results, so it's certainly viable.  Perhaps you packed the polyfill too tight, thus restricting airflow?  How bright, and what color temperature is your light source?  Perhaps answering the above will pinpoint your problem.<br />RR"}}
