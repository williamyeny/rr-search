Just let the faucet fill up the tub and run over the edges.  Use whatever you need to keep the substrate block from floating.  Allow the water to run for an hour, then drain and return to fruiting conditions.  The running water prevents contaminants building up during the dunk and also helps to wash contaminant spores that may have landed on your project down the drain.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dunking a casing?"}}
