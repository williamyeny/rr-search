It won't hurt, and with some species such as Shiitake, it's considered beneficial and makes them command a higher price.  In fact, they often lower humidity a few days before harvest to get the caps to crack.  With cubensis, they also tend to bruise, and many times cubes bruise more green than blue.<br />RR"}}
