Agar must be kept totally sterile.  A tray is far from sterile.  Here's a petri dish fruiting.  There is probably less than 1/10 gram there.  30 of these petri dishes would give you a three gram dose for ten times the expense of a tray of compost that would give ten times as much.  Agar is for cleaning up your mycelium to use as spawn.  Rye grain is great as a spawn medium to expand your mycelium, and compost, straw or manure are excellent fruiting substrates.  For best results, build on the experience of those who came before you.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-01/302731395-petri_dish.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/04-01/302731395-thumb_petri_dish.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: agar and mushrooms"}}
