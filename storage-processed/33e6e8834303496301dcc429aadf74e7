If you don't have a way to pasteurize it, then I suggest you just stick to the brf cakes as you learn the ropes.  I've never had much success with chemical pasteurization.  I've had the best results by washing the straw with dish soap and water, then pasteurize for an hour at 140F to 150F with one cup of hydrated lime added for each ten gallons of pasteurization water. Proper pasteurization will give you a two week window of opportunity to get the straw colonized to the point where the mushroom mycelium can hold its own against the contaminants. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilize Straw w/ out Boiling?"}}
