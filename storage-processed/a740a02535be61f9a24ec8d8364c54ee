If a scrub brush couldn't clean that stuff out, which happens to be dead skin cells and bacteria, nothing can clean it out. In addition, I have a movie of the sweat glands in my fingertips secreting, but it's too high resolution to post, so it's going on my DVD.  Your fingers sweat from a hundred or more glands around your fingertips, and it really pours out.  I could actually sit and watch the sweat come out, so I took a video of it.  If you're not wearing gloves, that sweat is going to drip into your work.  It wouldn't matter what you did to clean your hands first.  I should have included a distance shot of my hand along with the zoom pics.  My hands really were squeaky clean.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Still doing sterile work without gloves?"}}
