IDK man I'm so confused.</blockquote><br />You're confused by idiots without a clue.&nbsp; Hopefully, 5 days of no misting doesn't abort all your work.&nbsp; You're supposed to continue misting to replace the moisture which has evaporated.&nbsp; If the substrate dries out, your fruits are all going to abort.

Misting on the lid and keeping perlite moist below your cakes is good enough.</blockquote><br />False information-very bad advice.&nbsp; Get a grow or two under your belt before repeating bad advice from other noobs.&nbsp; The damn lid is plastic and has no need of water.&nbsp; Mushrooms are 90% water and DO have a need for it.&nbsp; Mist as required to prevent drying, while providing plenty of fresh air so the mushrooms don't ever sit saturated wet with no air.<br />I've always had to facepalm at these guys who say not to mist or to mist gently from way up so the mist falls ever so delicately.&nbsp; Folks, mushrooms fruit in nature after thunderstorms where heavy rain and hail beat the crap out of the manure pie.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mist during pinning stage?
