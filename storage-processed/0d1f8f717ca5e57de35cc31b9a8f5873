It's warmer inside the jars than outside.&nbsp; Get them out of that silly box and put them on a shelf in the open.&nbsp; They'll do far better that way where they can breath.&nbsp; You don't need to wipe them down with alcohol or peroxide either.&nbsp; The verm filter will keep the contents clean unless you disturb it enough to move it around, which then allows contaminants to get right in.<br />RR","title":"Re: First Grow; Mold Questions"}}
