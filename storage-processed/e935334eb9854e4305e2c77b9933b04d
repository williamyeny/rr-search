It might be nice for room light and for reading because it's 'warm', but you want light in the bluer end of the spectrum, so shoot for a frequency above 5,000 Kelvin.<br />Lumens do matter to an extent.  We're not deriving energy from the light, but it does need to be bright enough to penetrate into the casing layer.  Bright fluorescent light from a 'daylight' type tube seems to help generate the best pinsets over a wide range of species.  I have a four tube 48\" fluorescent fixture with 6500 Kelvin tubes in all four slots.  This light is plenty for my mini-greenhouse.  I have it hanging from the ceiling so it shines into the front of the greenhouse.  Reflective foil is on the back wall of the GH.<br />RR"}}
