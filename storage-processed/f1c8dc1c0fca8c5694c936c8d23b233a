If you simmer without soaking first, you'll get burst kernels, and you DON'T want burst kernels.  Let the rye soak for 24 to 36 hours.  This will hydrate it and also soften it so when you simmer(boil) for five minutes it will be at the perfect moisture content with no burst kernels.  I soak in weak coffee, so add a small amount of hydrated lime for ph balance.  You also want to add a pinch of gypsum per jar.<br />RR","title":"Re: soaking question"}}
