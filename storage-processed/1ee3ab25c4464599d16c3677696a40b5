The spores won't grow, I promise.<br />We're not talking about sterilizing here.&nbsp; You don't need to sterilize unsupplemented bulk substrates.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>k00laid said:</strong><br />spores dont really ever germinate on coir/verm<br />therefore, if you introduce an aggressive live culture, it will win the substrate.<br />basically.</blockquote><br />Not exactly.&nbsp; Pasteurization is about more than just killing the molds.&nbsp; It 'cooks' the substrate, making it easier for the mycelium to digest, just as cooking food makes it easier for us to digest.&nbsp; You can easily do a side-by-side test.&nbsp; Use hydrated, but non heat treated coir for one, and pasteurized coir for the other.&nbsp; You'll see the difference.&nbsp; This is true of all substrates, and is one of the reasons we get a much better biological efficiency indoors compared to outdoor wild fruitings, or outdoor fruitings in beds with unpasteurized substrates.<br />RR"}}
