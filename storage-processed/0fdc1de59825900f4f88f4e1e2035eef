I've tested 'no fanning' with many species with nice results.&nbsp; Shiitake is hardly effected by no fanning, while oyster mushrooms don't do well at all.&nbsp; Cubensis are generally high CO2 tolerant, but a few fannings each day can greatly cut down on trichoderma contamination, which is stimulated by stale, still air.<br />However, since fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger, I say fan it every time you think of it, regardless of all the holes.&nbsp; Mist at fannings, and you'll have the best of both worlds-high humidity and lots of fresh air.<br />RR","title":"Re: RR's FC and humidity question"}}
