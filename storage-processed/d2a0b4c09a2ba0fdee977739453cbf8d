That isn't cobweb on the second to last picture, it's mushroom mycelium.  The concentrated growth on A1 that resembles a fruit trying to form is normal.  We see that all the time. Give A8 the smell tetst.  If it smells like garbage, toss it.  If it smells like fresh mushrooms, it's ok. Good luck.<br />RR"}}
