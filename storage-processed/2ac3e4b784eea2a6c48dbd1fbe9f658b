I see no reason to bake the perlite because it isn't an organic compound that will contaminate by itself.  I still don't like the idea of standing water anywhere near a mushroom crop, but I can't argue with success, and many successful growers do things differently with great results.<br />I suggest you get a mechanical hygrometer that you can calibrate for your terrarium, and use the walmart special in your living room or office.<br />RR","title":"Re: Quick Q- PERLITE....Sterile???"}}
