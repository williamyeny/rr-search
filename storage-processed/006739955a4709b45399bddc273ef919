I wouldn't be without mine.  Bear in mind, you don't want to toss out your glovebox though, because when you isolate away from contaminants you will still use a glovebox.  Rule number one is never open a contaminated petri dish or jar, bag, etc, in front of the flowhood or the air will blow the contaminant spores everywhere.<br />RR"}}
