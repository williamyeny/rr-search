Try to stick to no more than 2/3 full, and if a jar is to be a receiver of G2G, fill only 1/2.  Also, if properly prepared, you shouldn't need to shake until the next morning when they're room temperature.  They stick to the sides like that from either not using gypsum, or failure to rinse the grain dust out before cooking.  The dry grains should be rinsed before further preparation because the dust, dirt, and other crap will float to the top of the pot where it can be poured off.  That sticky spot looks like dust/starches holding them stuck there.<br />RR"}}
