Manure should be field aged for at least three months, and even longer in the winter.  By breaking open a nugget or two, you can tell if it's ready.  It should be dry(unless it's raining that day) and zero smell other than a bit of earth/straw should come from it.  If it smells like fresh manure or ammonia, look for older kernels to use.<br />RR"}}
