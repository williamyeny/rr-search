Who the hell do you think started the 'coir as a bulk substrate' thing around here in the first place?  If you don't know, look it up. A year ago, everyone was saying 'coir has no nutes'.<br />An experienced grower can grow as much or more in a given sized rubbermaid using pf cakes than they can get from any other tek, including monotub or whatever because there is more surface area exposed for fruiting.<br />In addition, while a bulk grow is colonizing, the pf cakes are already fruiting.  There's just plenty of ways to do things, and I've grown a hundred times as much bulk as pf cakes, but won't knock a tek because it's what the 'beginners' use.  It's about more than ego.  A good tek deserves its recognition as a good tek.  <br />I won't let the new folks who are looking with an open mind at all the possiblities to be misled.  Play nice.<br />RR"}}
