Growers have dropped spore prints into their cows water troughs and had mushrooms shortly afterwards.   Another way they grow from spores in the wild is when the cow poops on ground that already has spores sitting in that spot.  The area under the cow pie is rife with bacteria and rotting organic matter, which in nature stimulates spore germination.<br />To grow indoors, follow the established techniques for sterile culture.  You can't duplicate nature's methods indoors.<br />RR"}}
