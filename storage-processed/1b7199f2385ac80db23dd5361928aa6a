You don't need to wait for pins to birth your cakes.  Put them in fruiting conditions a few days after full colonization.<br />2) No<br />3) Aborts are simply pins that yield the right of way to other pins.  A given substrate can only support so many fruits.  If more pins develop than can be supported, the mycelium automatically takes care of it by aborting the excess.  You pick the aborts when you pick the flush.<br />4) You soak then strain, then put the cake on a jar lid or foil to keep it separate from the perlite.  Don't allow the cake to sit on the perlite.  It will become waterlogged and perform poorly, if at all.<br />RR"}}
