Pf cakes can produce yields and potency to match any bulk substrate out there. In fact, there's no bulk substrate material that you can use in the quantities of a brf cake that will produce even close to brf.  It's neither a beginner nor a novelty method.<br />I'd suggest switching away from corn as a spawn.  It's the absolute worst possible choice.  Try rye berries as first choice, and wbs as second.  You have to remember that the grains you use as spawn are a major part of the overall substrate you fruit from.  Corn can support mycelium growth, but provides very little in the way of food for the fruiting stage.<br />Always add up to ten percent by volume of gypsum to any bulk substrate.  It can increase yields substantially.<br />RR"}}
