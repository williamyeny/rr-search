The holes should be on all six sides, and the sides of the tub need to be clear. In addition, I've posted dozens of times that blocking holes in a shotgun defeats the purpose.&nbsp; Not only does it LOWER humidity, it cuts down on fresh air(number ONE pinning trigger).&nbsp; Your hort dome gets FAR more light than that opaque tub.&nbsp; Once you birth the cakes, bright light becomes a major pinning trigger.&nbsp; You don't get that in a blue tub.&nbsp; In fact, light in the 'blue' spectrum tends to produce the best pinsets, and a blue tub absorbs exactly the spectrum you want for your fruiting cakes.<br />In addition, fresh air exchange causes a desired loss of moisture from the substrate, which is a major pinning trigger.&nbsp; You must mist the cakes directly to replace this lost moisture for best results.&nbsp; The perlite will get plenty of mist from the overspray, but it is the cakes themselves that need to be misted.<br />RR"}}
