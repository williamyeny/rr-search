They fruit better in the low 80's, so temperature needs to stay high.  They prefer manure based substrates, no more than 1 1/2\" thick.  Thicker substrates perform poorly, if at all.  Use peat/verm/sand casing no more than 1/4\" thick.  Don't worry if the entire casing colonizes.   Wax paper layed over the top after casiing colonization will help stimulate pinning.<br />RR","title":"Re: pan cyan question"}}
