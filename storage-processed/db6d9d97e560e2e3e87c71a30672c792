Most squirrel cage motors have the labled CFM determined at 1\".  Filters range from .8 to 1.25 or so.   <br />Based on that, your 465 CFM blower will give just over 200 linear feet per minute of 'airspeed' leaving your blower.  That is fine, if not a bit too much.  If you have a bit of excess airflow, you can either get a motor speed controller, or simply block off part of the intake, or even use a prefilter to restrict the volume of air.  The correct airflow will be achieved when you can light a cigarette lighter in front of the hood and it bends the flame over 90 degrees, but doesn't blow it out.<br />RR"}}
