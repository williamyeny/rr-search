If the RH is too low, they won't pin at all.  It sounds like a substrate/strain issue.<br />Hygrometers are useless until they've been calibrated.  Wrap that thing up in a damp towel for an hour, and then unwrap and adjust so it reads 99%, but as said, that isn't the cause of skinny mushrooms. Lack of light and/or poor substrate are the likely causes, provided they're getting enough fresh air.<br />RR"}}
