It's all the same species. When you use a single sporeprint, hundreds of 'strains' are created.  By way of dikaryotic/dikaryotic pairings, they reduce down in the end to a sigle or just a few strains by fruiting time. I've done it many times.  If you doubt this, try mixing a few syringes of different strains into the same jar.  Instead of 2cc's from a single syringe, try using 1/2cc from four different syringes(different strains).  Do a couple of control jars that are single strain.  I'll bet ya a dollar you can't tell jar from jar at fruiting time just by looking.<br />RR<br />RR","title":"Re: Mixing spore prints"}}
