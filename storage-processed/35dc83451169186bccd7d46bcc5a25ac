You want the center of the manure to reach 150F and stay there for an hour.  Get a meat thermometer to take the guesswork out.  Don't use the oven for the obvious reason that dry heat will dry your substrate.  Air is also a poor conductor of heat, while water is an excellent conductor, and your substrate won't dry out if it's in a bag or jars sitting in water.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Oven pasturization and water evaporation."}}
