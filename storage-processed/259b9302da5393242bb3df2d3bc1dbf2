If you can bring the ambient humidity up to 50%, you'll have no problems.  While it's true that Seattle has a damp climate in the fall, winter and spring, summers are very dry here.  I always run a cool mist 24/7 in the room my terrariums are located.  This becomes especially important if using a terrarium with many holes drilled into it.  Air exchange is a major pinning trigger as well as preventer of contamination, so make sure your ambient humidity is up to the task.<br />RR"}}
