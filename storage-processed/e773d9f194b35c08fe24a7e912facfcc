Foil will keep your filter material damp and a wet filter will allow contaminants to colonize through it.<br />45 minutes is also not long enough to PC rye berries.  Leave the weight off the pc for the first ten minutes after steam begins to escape, then put the weight on and build pressure.  Don't start counting time until the pressure reaches 15 psi.  Allow 75 to 90 minutes at 15 psi, then shut the stove off and walk away.  Allow to cool overnight before you open the PC.<br />No sterilization is absolute.  You only have a two to three week window of opportunity to get your grains colonized or you're playing russian roulette with your project.  Inoculate as soon as the jars cool to room temperature for best results.<br />The bottom jar is certainly wetspot bacteria.  It is identified by the 'greasy' appearance.  It's still a bit early to tell with the top two jars.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wet spot start i think"}}
