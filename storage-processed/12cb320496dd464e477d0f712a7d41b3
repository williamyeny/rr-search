The morons at the local home mega-store won't know what it is, even though it's in stock there.  You'll find it at large hardware stores, Bed bath & Beyond, and larger drug stores.  It's for drying out your carpet after spills.  You'll also find it at boat stores.  Boat owners use it before they cover up their boats after use, to prevent molds from growing in the interior.<br />RR"}}
