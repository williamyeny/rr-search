Other than that, don't do anything different.  They're not as cold temperature tolerant as cubes, so try to keep fruiting conditions in the 75F to 85F range.  They usually take a few days to a week longer to pin than cubes as well. Shotgun terrarium will work fine.  <br />I don't like them anymore.  The trip always seemed a bit on the dark side, not pleasant at all in my experience.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pan. Cyanescens vs P. Cubensis"}}
