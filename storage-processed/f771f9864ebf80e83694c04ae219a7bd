Blue Helix picked up some hydrated lime at a chemical supplier that was formulated for steel and/or concrete plants and was ten times the strength of agricultural grade hydrated lime.  That's the reason he had poor results.<br />If you use hydrated lime, be sure to get hydrated garden lime.  You can use limestone flour, oyster shell flour, etc.   Be sure to use the flour because it will break down and go to work right away.  Pelletized lime is useless because it needs a whole season to break down into the soil.<br />Adjust for a ph of 8 to 8.5, and use gypsum at up to ten percent the amount of peat.  Coir is better suited as a substrate than a casing.  Casing with coir is like casing with horse manure as they both have similar nutes when it comes to fungi.  A non-nutritious casing layer will produce better results in my experience.<br />RR"}}
