The pellet lime and fertilizer are intended to break down oudoors in a lawn or garden all season.  Go to a different nursery and get hydrated garden lime.<br />Gypsum keeps the ph from swinging either direction radically.  It also supplies calcium and sulphur which help fruitbodies to develop. Again, get powdered gypsum, not pellets.  If all you can find is pellets, break them up with a hammer. (don't do this with the lime though, it's probably dolomitic which is the wrong kind)<br />RR","title":"Re: garde lime and gypsum\\"}}
