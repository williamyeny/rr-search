You don't have to use a pressure cooker with pf tek.  You don't have to cover the holes with pf tek, other than with foil during steaming, which is removed after sterilization.  You're supposed to flame sterilize between jars, but don't wipe with alcohol afterward.  Simply use the needle a few seconds after you pull it from the torch.  The first drop will cool the needle, and the rest will flow cleanly. <br />If the contaminant is growing from the injection sites, and you flame sterilized the needle, then your inoculant was contaminated.  It isn't related to your sterilization procedure.<br />RR"}}
