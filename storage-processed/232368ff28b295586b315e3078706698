You'll want to add 1/2 inch or so of casing material to the top of the grains when it reaches full colonization.  Read up on casing.  I recommend 50/50 peat-verm.  Cut the top half of the bag off just at the level of the top of your casing layer and place in a fruiting chamber.  If you don't have one, just cut a few slits in the top half of the bag for air exchange and use the bag for its own fruiting chamber.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mycobag fruiting???"}}
