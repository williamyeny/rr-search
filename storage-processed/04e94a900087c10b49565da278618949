Every time I've had perfectly colonized spawn but still I got trich before the first flush (right after switching to fruiting mode). The new substrate got colonized but trich came on top of it anyway.</blockquote><br />Two things.&nbsp; 1. Oust is a nice product, but it's no more effective than placing a spoonful of laundry bleach into your mister of water and spraying the room well with that.&nbsp; Spray up into the room, and allow the mist to fall to the floor, trapping and carrying mold and bacteria along with it, by force of gravity.&nbsp; Don't spend a lot of time looking for an expensive product when you have something already in your house that will work just as well.<br />2. If your bulk substrate trays grew mold prior to first flush, then it was your spawn which was contaminated, no doubt.&nbsp; By attempting to clean up your 'spawning to bulk' work area, you're fixing what wasn't broken and missing what the actual cause is.&nbsp; You need to examine your sterile procedure when producing your spawn media.&nbsp; It's very common for molds to remain dormant and not be seen until later after spawning to bulk, which makes it hard to diagnose, but absolutely you need to be looking at your spawn and not your bulk substrate technique.<br />RR"}}
