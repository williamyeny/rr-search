I use a super allergen type furnace filter simply duct taped over the intake of the squirrel cage fan.  You can disregard the impedence of the prefilter.<br />Be sure to get a laminar flow hepa filter.  They're usually made from ceramic and aluminum.  As a rule of thumb, you can just figure on 1\" of static pressure being standard.  Some filters are rated .9 and others might be as high as 1.3 or so.  In the US, most squirrel cage blowers with a CFM rating have it based on that 1\" of static pressure.  Because of that, just disregard static pressure and look at cfm.(I can feel anno squirming as I say that...lol)  You want between 100 and 150 <i>linear</i> feet per minute passing over your work space.  So, a two square foot filter would need between a 200 and 300 cfm blower to deliver that velocity.  Don't forget to build a plenum behind the filter for the fan to pressurize to the 1\" of static pressure.  The static pressure on the back side of the filter is how we get the even flow out the front to our work area.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flowhood Questions- Matching filters and blowers"}}
