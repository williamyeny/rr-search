All you're trying to do is stop wind currents after you've wiped your jar with alcohol and flamed your needle. This hobby is too expensive and too much work to cut corners.&nbsp; Those who do, never seem to know which corner they cut that resulted in the mold, so they're left guessing.&nbsp; Those who don't cut <i>any</i> corners rarely experience mold.<br />RR"}}
