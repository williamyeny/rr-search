However, it's entirely possible to inoculate an unsterilized pf cake with enough liquid/mycelium inoculant that the mushroom mycelium colonizes the cakes before contaminant molds, which must germinate from spores, can get a foothold.<br />By Advanced Forum guidelines, this belongs in general cultivation.  I'll move it over there for you.  Good luck with your experiments!<br />RR","title":"Re: Two years of work... (moved)"}}
