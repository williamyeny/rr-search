I don't see any obvious bacterial contaminants in it.  As I read this forum, I see a lot more problems from using incubators than going without them.  It's getting into summer in the northern hemisphere, so if you're there, you ought to be able to find a nice place in the upper seventies to let your jars colonize.  The light won't hurt.  Light doesn't become a pinning trigger until after full colonization and exposure to increased air exchange.  At the colonizing jar stage, it has no noticable effect.  Any jars that do happen to pin before full colonization have something else wrong and the natural defense mechanisms tells the mycelium to send up a fruit to drop spores.  They'll do better on a shelf than in a stale box.  My incubation area for years has been a simple shelf in my room exposed to normal room temperature(mid to upper 70's) and lighting.<br />RR","title":"Re: Weird smell but nothing unusual"}}
