You're supposed to use a shredder, lawn mower, weed whacker, etc., to chop the straw into 1\" to 3\" pieces.  Doing so will tighten up the straw and prevent your grains from going to the bottom.<br />In addition, when building straw tubs, don't mix the spawn into the straw.  Put down a layer of straw, followed by a layer of grain spawn.  This will also help to keep your spawn in place until it takes off.<br />RR"}}
