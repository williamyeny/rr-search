I would never consider using an LC without making a microscope slide to check for bacterial rods first.  It only takes a few minutes.  I also fail to see why so many folks are making LC's in the first place when only growing small amounts.  You have to inoculate the LC, then wait for it to grow, then inoculate the jar of grains or brf, etc., doubling your risk of introducing contaminants.   Why not just skip the LC step? Personally, I don't make them.<br />RR","title":"Re: bacteria, not mold"}}
