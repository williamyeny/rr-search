Everytime you let trich sporulate in your growing area, future crops become harder and harder.  Clean up the best you can.  The biggest impact is on your sterile work, which is going to get harder.  Fruiting chambers need a LOT of air exchange, and so-called incubation chambers are dumb. If you have a spot in your house that's 75F, use it.  If not, get one.  You don't need to 'incubate' unless you're trying to hatch chiken eggs.  Incubators are directly responsible for a lot of the contamination people experience.<br />RR","title":"Re: Post Contamination Care Question"}}
