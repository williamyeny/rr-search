I doubt they're your problem. An hour at 15 psi should be plenty if there's ample room between the jars for the steam to penetrate.  Be sure to let the PC vent steam for several minutes before you put the weight on or close the valve.  It's necessary to heat the interior, including the glass surface of the jars, and vent out all the air before building pressure.<br />That said, there is bacteria in the air everywhere.  If your verm barrier is damp, the bacteria can colonize right through it to the rice flour below.  Perhaps your rice is too wet, or you're not getting the jars properly covered before sterilization?  Remember, when the steam hits the cooler lid of the PC, it turns back to water and rains down on the jars.  This is the reason for the foil covers.<br />Your PC should never run dry even during a three hour cycle.  Be sure to reduce heat as soon as it reaches pressure to the minimum setting that will maintain the 15 psi.  Very little rattling of the weight should be allowed.  If the weight rattles, turn down the heat slightly.  If pressure drops below the target 14.5 psi, increase heat slightly.<br />It actually sounds like either your verm is getting wet/damp, or perhaps your syringes are getting contaminated.  Remember also, one of the biggest sources of bacteria is your own breath, so wear a surgical, not dust mask.  A close second is your skin and especially under your fingernails, so wear gloves that have been washed with alcohol.<br />If you're 'incubating' your jars, have plenty of ventilation.  If they're in a closed up container, the humidity can cause your filter material to get wet, rendering it useless.  I recommend incubating on an open shelf at room temperature for the reduction in these problems.  The extra two or three days it takes to colonize a jar is worth the reduced risk of contamination.  Good luck in finding and fixing the probelem.<br />RR","title":"Re: PPP - Partial Pressure Pf"}}
