Read carefully what the other has to say and don't draw conclusions based on a quick read where hot tempered emotion causes you miss the entire point. I was showing that we're in agreement on 90% of what is being discussed. <br />Flaming is never allowed in cultivation.&nbsp; Furthermore, public discussion of masturbation in the same breath as claiming a dedication to academia are mutually exclusive. Don't do that again.<br />RR","title":"Re: When pinning starts should lighting be cut back?"}}
