It's not mentioned in the video.  I kept the video to the basic teks to avoid confusion.  If I had gone into a fifteen minute talk about using coffee, something else would have had to get cut out to make room, because both disks are full.  Grains work fine without coffee, but with it you get an extra boost.  Coffee will not contaminate or cause your spawn to contaminate.  Not following proper sterile procedure will cause contamination.  If your grains are properly sterilized, and then kept sterile with proper filtered gas exchange, coffee causes no increase in rates of contamination.<br />RR"}}
