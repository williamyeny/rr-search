I've said on the record since they first started appearing in the early 90's that they'd ruin mycology as we know it, and they have.  Spore syringes allow non-mycologists to obtain drugs with little to no effort.  After all, making a pf cake is no harder than making jello, and any junkie can stick a needle in his arm. . .or that pf cake.<br />I don't want to see big brother telling us what we can or can't do, but when the spore vendors won't even take the effort to obtain blunt tip needles for their product, they're digging their own graves.  I think the hobby is much better served by getting back to prints, learning agar work, and building gloveboxes and flowhoods.  This is why you've NEVER seen me post a spore syringe tek, and never will.<br />RR"}}
