The whole idea of using alcohol is to kill bacteria and mold spores. Cells don't admit substances without water.  That's why up to 30% water is added to alcohol used to sanitize skin or other surfaces.  It tricks the cell walls into admitting it, and then as the alcohol evaporates back out, it kills the cell.<br />In addition, trying to stop contaminants with a coffee filter is like trying to stop a bird with a barbed wire fence.  Look at a coffee filter under a microscope.  The holes in it are ten times or more the size of contaminant spores.<br />RR","title":"Re: Does alcohol dry up fast?"}}
