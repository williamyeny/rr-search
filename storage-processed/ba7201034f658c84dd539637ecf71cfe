If using limestone, no more than ten percent, with up to ten percent gypsum.  If using hydrated garden lime, use one teaspoon per cup of dry peat.<br />Peat comes in dry bales.  It must be hydrated after mixing with the lime and gypsum.  Most of us now use an equal amount of moist vermiculite mixed with the peat after the peat has been brought to field capacity.<br />RR"}}
