It's too easy to simply mist.  Where injection can help is if the substrate <i>below</i> the casing gets too dry.  Just inject 2cc into each of half a dozen spots around the substrate.  If you inject slowly, the water will stay where you put it.  2cc isn't going to make a geyser.<br />Injection is also a benefit if your pf cakes are too dry during a flush.  An injection can hold them over until after the flush when you can dunk.  Just don't overdo it.  You don't want a waterlogged cake or bulk substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Injecting casings with water"}}
