Two liters of grain spawn cased?  No bulk there, only spawn and casing.  Any uncolonized grain spawn is likely to contaminate with molds, once exposed to air.<br />5 generations?  What sort of harvests did the other 4 generations deliver?  A 'generation' means you fruited a flush, made a spore print, germinated the spores and grew them again.  Do that five times and you have five generations.<br />In addition, I've advised for years to NOT wrap the sides of trays with aluminum foil.  The foil reflects light deep into the substrate, causing bottom and side pinning.<br />RR","title":"Re: That mistake that happens, it happened."}}
