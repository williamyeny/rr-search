In a few days it will be ready for the casing layer.  You can just dump the casing right on top of the myc, metabolytes and all.  I used to use the corner of a paper towel to dab up the excess but no longer do.  It spreads out into the casing layer fine, possibly even offering protection.  I've dumped metabloytes onto bacteral contaminated petri dishes and it kills the bacteria dead.<br />RR","title":"Re: R to the izzo and a piss puddle"}}
