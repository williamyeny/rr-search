It becomes much worse when people make their own syringes and make them very dark.  Some strains are not compatible, so when someone uses multispore inoculation, it's common to still have two or three strains active at fruiting.  Each strain carves out its niche and holds it.   Most strains combine into a single organism through the process of anastomosis, but the non-compatible ones don't, therefore you'll have several different substrains growing in the same tray.<br />RR"}}
