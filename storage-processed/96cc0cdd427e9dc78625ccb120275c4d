It doesn't matter if it goes in the pc or not, if there is brf on the lip, contaminants will use it as a path from the holes on top to your substrate below, bypassing the dry verm.<br />As for the weight, it only rattles to let excess steam escape.  Steam escaping is water escaping.  If you're going to use the minimum amount of water necessary, you don't want to lose any.
