They're not better for the environment than plastic disposable.  It takes soap to wash them, and fossil fuel energy to sterilize them.  They're also heavy, slippery and breakable. Unless you have a sterile lab for the pressure cooker to cool down in, they'll be contaminated even before you pour the agar. When you're talking about needing a hundred or more to follow through a strain isolation series, that's a few hundred dollars worth of glass dishes, or ten dollars worth of pre-sterilized plastic ones.  I speak from many years of experience here people.  Forget the glass dishes if you're planning any more than simply germinating spores to transfer to grains.  If you're seriously into doing mycology expermentation, you'll need far too many petri dishes to mess with expensive and breakable glass.<br />RR"}}
