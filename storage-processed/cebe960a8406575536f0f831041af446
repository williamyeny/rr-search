They'll fruit fine in the 5 to 6.5 range.  However, that is also the ph that contaminants like the green molds prefer.  Mushroom mycelium is tolerant of higher ph levels, while the contaminant molds are not.  Use a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat, and also a tablespoon of gypsum per cup of peat.  Mix the dry ingredients together well, then add water and then mix with your already moistened vermiculite.  The above will make your casing layer more resistant to contaminants.  It won't make it fruit any better or worse.<br />RR","title":"Re: looking for advice on adjusting ph."}}
