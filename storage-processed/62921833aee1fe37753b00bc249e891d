I use 2cc for a quart jar, so if your mycobag holds more than a quart/liter, you probably used too little inoculant.  Also, if you shook the bag up after inoculation, it set you back.  It's best to squeeze out your spores in one spot and let them germinate there so that compatable hyphae can 'mate' and become dikaryotic, then shake the bag a week or so later to distribute the dikaryons.  Dikaryotic mycleium grows much faster than monokaryotic, so if you shake the bag immediately after inoculation with spores, you're forcing the slow growing monokaryotic mycelium to colonize the grains, only mating when they encounter each other.  This slows down the process.  <br />RR","title":"Re: mycobag worries...."}}
