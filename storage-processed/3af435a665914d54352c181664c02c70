A hot oven creates air movement into the oven.(cold, high density air always flows towards warm, low density air) In addition, the expansion of the hot air causes turbulence, thus increasing the air movement around your sterile work area.  That's why the oven tek is shit.<br />RR","title":"Re: Not to confident in my methods here..."}}
