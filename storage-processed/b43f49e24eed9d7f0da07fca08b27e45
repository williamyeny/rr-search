Say your talking like 2 quarts of spawn and 3 quarts of subtrate per tub say 25 tubs.. 75 quarts of subtrate is going to need how much gypsum?</blockquote><br />I mix about 100 pounds of substrate in my concrete mixer per batch.&nbsp; 1 to 1 1/2 cups of gypsum is plenty for that amount.&nbsp; I used to recommend 10%, but after more experiments I found you can reduce the amount considerably without a reduction in performance. I now use about 1% to 2% by weight.&nbsp; 10% still works well for casing layers, but most members here don't case bulk substrates these days.<br />RR"}}
