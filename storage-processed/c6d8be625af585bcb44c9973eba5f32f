You may have to repeat the treatment a few times as it's normal for it to come back a bit after just one or two sprayings.<br />We throw away projects with green molds, but cobweb mold is very easy to kill with peroxide, and easy to prevent with good fresh air exchange.  As said previously, spray the entire surface, not just what you see because cobweb spreads by breaking off tiny fragments of mycelium and sending them airborne to spread.  Spray the entire surface to take care of what is still too small to see.<br />Also, as said already, don't sterilize casing material.  It should be pasteurized only for best results.  You'll still get cobweb sometimes with pasteurized casing, but your chances of getting the green molds will be much less.   Also, according to Paul Stamets, there is evidence that the beneficial bacteria that survive pasteurization will help stimulate a better pinset.  My experiments have confirmed this as well.<br />RR"}}
