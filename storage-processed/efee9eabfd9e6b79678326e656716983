The next person who posts a flame in this thread is going to get banned for a day.  Enough is enough.  Either contribute to the discussion in a positive way, or stay the hell out.  I tried to lighten things up and smooth them out, but was unable.  PM's didn't seem to help either.  <br />The thread is about making liquid mycelium from fully colonized grain jars.  It's not about ego, it's not about who thought of it first, but rather about helping people to find a better way of doing things. Please keep it that way.  Thanks.<br />RR"}}
