The contamination stops the mycelium, therefore 'full colonization' is achieved and the mycelium fruits.<br />Another cause if not using a proper lid, the substrate can dry out.  When that happens, it sends a signal to reproduce or die, so a fruit is formed.<br />You can also easily force them to fruit invitro by removing the lid, increasing air flow around the jar, and exposing to light.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-03/747203393-Redboy_invitro_002a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-03/747203393-thumb_Redboy_invitro_002a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: half colonized jar pinned and grew a shroom"}}
