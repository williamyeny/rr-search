A physical law of science is that water turns to a vapor at 100C/212F.  Therefore, if you heat the interior of the jar to that temperature, it will be as dry as the sand in the sahara desert in the summertime.<br />If a fly deposits its eggs into an open inoculation hole, the eggs will hatch and the maggots will crawl down into the substrate to feed.  Use micropore tape over the inoculation holes if flys are a problem in your area.<br />NEVER allow jars to sit for several days to 'see if contams grow'.  If they were properly sterilized, contamination will have been killed.  Inoculate when the jars have cooled to room temperature.<br />Follow the tek and either steam sterilize for 60 to 90 minutes, or pressure sterilze at 15 psi for 45 to 60 minutes.<br />RR"}}
