However, there is only so much food in a cake, so total yield is not going to be much different either way.  You'll get more flushes from a cake, but one or two larger ones from crumbling and casing.   <br />If you're going to crumble the cakes, I'd suggest crumbling them into coir, manure or straw in order to give the mycelium some more food to eat, rather than simply crumbling as-is, and then putting a casing layer over it.<br />RR","title":"Re: a little confused here?"}}
