Many growers apply casing layers at different times, and some even apply the casing at the time the bulk substrate is spawned.  <br />Contaminants will easily germinate on damp verm, and then spread their mycelium to your substrate below. The verm barrier works in pf jars because it's dry. In addition, nothing 'wicks' contaminants, verm or no verm. <br />Proper procedures of pasteurization and air exchange are the keys to avoiding contaminants in substrate trays.  Sterility and good filtering are the keys to avoiding contaminants during spawn production.  It's important not to confuse the two.<br />RR"}}
