I also boil in the soak water.  If you soak for 24 hours, the rye will absorb little to no additional moisture during the boil.  I just boil for five minutes to kill the live bacteria before pouring down the sink, and to get the rye steaming hot when drained so the steam will evaporate, thus drying the exterior of the grains.<br />If you skip the soak, sure, add coffee to the simmer water.<br />RR"}}
