Bruising is just like when you get a bruise on your body.  The skin is blue.   mold spores on the other hand, look like a 'scab' that would form on your body, only thinner and green.  Mold spores will be above the mycelium or cake, and look like a dusting on the surface.<br />If the cake is damp, I've seen blue bruising transfer to a q-tip.  That's why I quit recommending that test a year or two ago.<br />RR"}}
