By clicking that link, you'll get all the info you need and four short videos that show you everything to do. <br />I donate a lot of my time to local schools, teaching the kids how to grow oysters and shiitake mushrooms on brf cakes.&nbsp; One of the best projects I've seen yet came from a 12 year old girl with down syndrome.&nbsp; Therefore, if she can succeed growing edibles on brf cakes, anybody can. Nothing makes me think someone around here is a total idiot more than seeing them trash the brf tek as being <i>too complicated</i>. In addition, it's the FASTEST way to go from spore syringe to fruits.<br />This hobby is not for the lazy.&nbsp; If you'll get away from that mindset, you'll succeed.&nbsp; Grains must be handled in a completely sterile environment and cased.&nbsp; Uncased grains won't fruit.&nbsp; The oven idea for sterile work is just plain dumb and was disproved many years ago.&nbsp; I've even deleted the so-called 'tek' from the main site.<br />RR","title":"Re: The laziest cultivator ever"}}
