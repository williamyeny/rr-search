For a cell to be destroyed by alcohol, the alcohol must be admitted into the cell via osmosis.  However, cells are very good at keeping out substances that would kill them.  That's why we mix water with the alcohol.  The water 'tricks' the cell wall into admitting the alcohol, and then it kills the cell when it evaporates back out again.  Use 70% alcohol for best results.<br />However, alcohol will do nothing against the contaminants that are INside the needle, so you'd be injecting them right into your substrate.  Use flame sterilization, and there is no need to wait for the needle to cool.  It will cool enough on the way from the flame to the jar, and the first drop or two of solution will finish cooling the needle so that the rest can flow cleanly.<br />RR"}}
