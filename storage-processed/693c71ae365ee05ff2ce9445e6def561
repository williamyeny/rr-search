Gloveboxes work by providing still air, not sterile, and not moving air.&nbsp; I've seen at least a hundred so-called positive pressure gloveboxes built over the years, but I don't know of a single one still being used.&nbsp; They create turbulence, thus swirling contaminants into your media and causing more contamination than they stop.<br />RR"}}
