If the question has already been answered, I move on. The forum guidelines state that posts bumped within 48 hours are to be closed.&nbsp; I've been cutting slack, but that's the rule.&nbsp; You're not the first to get that mentioned to.&nbsp; The forum is getting really busy, so you guys have to wait.&nbsp; There's not as many who can answer agar questions, so it takes longer.<br />Your problem was using hot water to mix the agar.&nbsp; Always mix the dry ingredients first, then add a small amount of room temperature water and swirl it around until the powder is dissolved.&nbsp; Don't shake, just swirl.&nbsp; Then add the rest of the water and sterilize.&nbsp; Pour the dishes before the agar cools below 100F or it will begin to solidify.<br />I had an awesome day, btw. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />RR"}}
