Yeild was a bit over 4 lbs wet.  Longer logs do much better. (bigger substrate=bigger fruit bodies)  Lots of folks over at Mycotopia are starting logs now.  In 2-3 weeks you should be hearing from them.  They pin in 2 weeks, and the flush is over in 3 weeks.  Take the leftover log out to your garden and use it to mulch your veggies.  The leftover myc will help your garden, and you should get a few really big mushies in the fall.  The tek(with pictures) is posted there in the 'fungi' section. "}}
