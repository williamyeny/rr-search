They save the contractor money on installation because they fit right into the duct system, and the business or homeowner pays for it forever with higher energy costs.<br />By the way, the inline fans are squrrel cage type.  They just have far fewer blades than a normal squirrel cage blower will have.  They're for high cfm, low load applications such as exhaust fans.  When put under static pressure, the cfm drops substantially.  You can see that information if you pull up the pdf document on the engineering specs.<br />RR"}}
