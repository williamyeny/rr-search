Set your camera up so it's on a tripod and pointing at your grow.  You'll need an accurate cycle timer to control your lights, because to get good pictures, lighting needs to be nice and bright.  Once you get the lighting timer dialed in, monitor it and adjust dorgem to take the picture right in the middle of the 20 seconds or so that your lights are on.<br />Dorgem will store the pictures in a file as jpegs.  When you're done taking the pictures, you can use a program such as 'make avi' to put all the jpegs together into a movie.  In fact, make avi can even do the compression for you to whatever format you want it.<br />I did about a dozen time lapses of edibles for my video, but ran out of space on the two disks to include them in this edition.  Perhaps in a future release.  I might even say fuck it and put them on youtube, who knows.<br />RR","title":"Re: How do I do a time lapse video?"}}
