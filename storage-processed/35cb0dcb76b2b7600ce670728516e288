You can remove the lid to do this, but I'd recommend a glovebox.  The vermiculite barrier that 'should' be there will protect the brf below.  If you use a small nail to punch the hole, you can do it with the lid still on, but wrap an alcohol soaked paper towel around the nail as you tap it gently to punch the hole.  There will be vacuum in the jar, so air will be drawn in.  The alcohol soaked paper towel will help filter the air that gets pulled in.   <br />Be sure not to drive the nail more than 1/8\" inch or so.  If it pentrates the verm barrier, the brf below will get contaminated.<br />RR"}}
