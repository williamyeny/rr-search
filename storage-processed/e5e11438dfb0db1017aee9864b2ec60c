You want limestone flour, calcium carbonate flour, or hydrated lime.  Granulated will be of no use, because it takes too long to break down. You want horticultural lime.  They use food grade calcium carbonate in beer making, but it's up to ten times the price of horticultural lime.  The so-called 'long term buffers' are not required because the life of a casing layer is 'short term', lasting only a couple of months at most.  I've been recommending hydrated lime for years.  It's water soluable and therefore goes to work right away to prevent contaminant spores from germinating.<br />RR"}}
