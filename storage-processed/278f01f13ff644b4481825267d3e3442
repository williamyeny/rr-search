Mold spores already don't like to germinate on coir. The main reason we 'pasteurize' it is to cook the coir so it's easier for the mushroom mycelium to consume.&nbsp; You really do need heat.&nbsp; Try a crock pot on the back porch or something, or rig up a solar pasteurizer which is really easy with an umbrella and some foil.<br />If it's really hot, you may even find filling a dark colored pot with hot water and your coir and then placing it out in the sun will reach pasteurization temp. If not, heat it on the stove first and then set it out in the sun.<br />RR"}}
