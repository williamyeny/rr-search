However, there was a small crack in the plastic container, so some water ran out. However, since the mushrooms started to grow I wasnt sure wether it would matter or not. Could it be that the material didnt soak up enough water?<br />If that is the cause, is it too late to add more water?</blockquote><br />Your substrate is too dry.&nbsp; Put it back under a faucet and let it gently run for an hour or so and then put the tray back into fruiting after draining.&nbsp; You need more light.&nbsp; Put it closer to the window or put a bright fluorescent lamp just above the terrarium.<br />RR"}}
