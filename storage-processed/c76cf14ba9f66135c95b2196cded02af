My quart jars of rye berries colonize in a week to ten days with 2 to 4 ml of inoculant, and that's at room temperature.<br />If you're only growing a very small amount, a small PC is great.  Lots of us are experimenting with various species and teks, and therefore go through a lot more spawn, which makes a larger pressure cooker a very good investment.<br />RR"}}
