I use perlite and don't make any attempt to sterilize it as it's not necessary.  I simply pour it out of the bag into a strainer, run water through it, allow to drain and dump right into the terrarium.  The time to be sterile is when you're inoculating the cakes.  Once birthed, be clean, but don't worry about sterility.<br />RR"}}
