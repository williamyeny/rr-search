I was looking at the electric sterilizers but was thinking that what if something goes wrong with the hotplate part then the whole thing is ruined. how many quart jars can you fit in the AA 75x? </blockquote><br />It doesn't have a 'hotplate', but rather an element similar to what you find on a water heater that is easily replaced.&nbsp; I keep two spare heating elements in stock in case one goes out at a horrible time, but so far, the original elements are still working after a few years.<br />I can fit 20 quart sized jars in my AA75X sterilizers without the insert, 14 with the insert in place.<br />RR"}}
