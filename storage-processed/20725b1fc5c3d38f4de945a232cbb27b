Greenhouses are fruiting chambers.  Colonize your trays on a shelf in a warm room.  If the room is too cold, run a space heater.  Any temperature in the 70's to very low 80's is great for colonizing bulk substrates.<br />Don't try to heat a mini-greenhouse.  Most mushroom species will fruit very well in the sixties, cubes included.  If the room gets too cold, again run a space heater, but don't try to heat the greenhouse itself.  All you'll do is make condensation on the walls.<br />RR","title":"Re: Turnining up the heat."}}
