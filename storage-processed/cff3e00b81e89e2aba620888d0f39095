We have members here who are constantly researching and trying new experiments, and when those experiments are complete, they post their results. <br />It would be far more productive to post that you're considering something such as brassinolide and ask if anyone has any information on the topic.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Brassinolide and P.cube: Increased yield and growth...How-To"}}
