A couple of hours of my free time to PC, then clean them out costs more than that.  I'd rather be doing something else during that time.  Anyway, the point is don't open contaminated jars in your house, or even outside unless you've positioned the jar downwind from yourself.  Trichoderma spores are extremely sticky and will stick to your clothes, skin, hair, etc., and then you'll just bring it back inside with you.  Molds are killed by temperatures around 140F, so as long as you boil them for an hour or two before opening the jar, you're fine.  I see no reason to PC them, unless that's just easier.<br />RR","title":"Re: First grow, Green Mold... Owned :("}}
