You want a jar with a very small lid that admits fewer contaminants when open.  In addition, containers with small opening and long necks are easier to pour without making a mess.  Be sure to not add peroxide if you'll be working with spores.  Peroxide is toxic to them.  It's only to help with molds if you're trying to isolate a wild strain that has bacteria, but I don't use it even for that.  Peroxide hurts the mushroom mycelium almost as much as the molds, so it sets your mycelium back at the same time as you're really wanting rapid growth.
