We toss out substrates on first sight when we see molds in order to protect our growing area from the spores the molds will release that will contaminate future crops.  Even if A <i>flavus</i> was present in a substrate, there is not one single shred of evidence to support that toxins would be transferred to the fruiting bodies of our crops.  Fungi simply do not function that way. Mushrooms do not have vascular systems that uptake water and nutrients the way plants do.<br />RR","title":"Re: safe to use contaminated cultures in outdoorbed???????"}}
