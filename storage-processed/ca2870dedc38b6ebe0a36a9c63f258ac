Leaving the stump is not going to rot any more than the rest of the substrate will.&nbsp; In addition, mushrooms don't have roots.<br />Best results are obtained by slicing off the stem at or just above substrate level.&nbsp; Obviously, one needs a sharp knife.<br />Some strains barely attach to the substrate and fall over on their own when mature.&nbsp; However, most are tenaciously attached to the substrate and need to be cut off.<br />RR"}}
