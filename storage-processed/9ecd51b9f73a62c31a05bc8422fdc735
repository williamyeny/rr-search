In addition, the large kernel size of corn means there is far fewer kernels in each jar, thus less mycelium in each jar than if a traditional spawn such as rye was used.  Corn was never good and now bad.  It was always bad.  That's why not one single mushroom farm uses it for spawn generation, and they depend on success to make a living. Some people have success with corn.  I made hundreds of projects with corn and had success, but not at the same rate as with rye, and it was never as good as rye when it comes to grain to grain transfers or spawning, because you need to grow out four or five times as many jars to get the same amount of mycelium, thus further increasing your chances for contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn, to substrate ratio?"}}
