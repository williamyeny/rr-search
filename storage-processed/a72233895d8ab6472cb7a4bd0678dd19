Not only is sterilization in a jar or bag not always complete, but many filter patch bags have defective filters these days which change pore size during sterilization.&nbsp; The longer you let one sit, the less your chances of success are.&nbsp; We sterilize a few thousand large filter patch bags per week on <a href=\"http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">our farm</a>, so we're able to get a better handle exactly how to achieve the <i>maximum possible</i> success rate since our livelihood depends on it.<br />That said, I've used grain jars up to a year old before with success.&nbsp; It's just not recommended, especially if you're going to use it later for grain to grain transfers.&nbsp; Often the mycelium can hold its own against competitors until after a few transfers when the contaminant gets ahead on the uncolonized grains and takes over.<br />RR"}}
