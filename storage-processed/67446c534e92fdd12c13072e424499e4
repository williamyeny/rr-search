Wear gloves that have been washed in alcohol after putting them on.  Wipe the surfaces of all jars, both donor and receiving, with alcohol. Never have a jar open for more than a few seconds.  Working fast and accurately is important. Have a well sealed, still air glovebox and you'll have great success.  This is much, much faster than squirting spores into an lc, and the mycelium is proved before you use it by sight and smell.<br />RR"}}
