It's a 'cross' but not a hybrid.  Now, if a human could make a baby with a cow, or a cube can cross with a reishi, THAT would be a hybrid.<br />Monokaryons of various strains of cubensis will easily pair up.  Workman and I have both posted pictures and procedures(we do it differently) in advanced mycology, so a search there will bring up the threads. Dikaryons can also mate with dikaryons from another strain, but the results are faster when a toxin such as snake venom is placed in the petri dish with the agar.  Look in advanced for threads from 2004-2005.<br />RR"}}
