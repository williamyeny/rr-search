Perlite doesn't fall out through 1/4\" holes.<br />The purpose of the holes is natural convection that humidifies the air and helps to provide air exchange.  A rubbermaid/sterlite type terrarium with 1/4\" holes drilled all over on all six sides will maintain mid 90's humidity, provided it has four inches or so of rinsed, then well drained perlite in the bottom.<br />RR"}}
