Try putting it beside the shelf rather than on the bottom one, which will cause the mist to&nbsp; condense when it hits the shelf above, and then drip back down.&nbsp; If it's beside the shelf, it will have a clear shot all the way to the ceiling, allowing the mist evaporate into the greenhouse air.<br />RR"}}
