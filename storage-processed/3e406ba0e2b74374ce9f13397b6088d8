Remember, mushroom tissue is mycelium.  Anything below the substrate level doesn't need to be removed anyway.<br />The strength of the mushroom/substrate connection is strain related, not casing/no-casing related.  I have an isolated strain that the fruits fall over and unhook themselves from the substrate just as the veil tears, whether cased or not.  That quality comes in really handy when I'm on an outside job working long hours.<br />RR","title":"Re: Uncased coir: I'M NOT IMPRESSED."}}
