People are simply still confused as usual.  You don't need to pH balance substrates, since they fully colonize within ten days to two weeks.  Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, but is more tolerant of a high pH than molds, thus we raise the pH on our casing layers since they don't fully colonize.<br />If your substrate contaminated, chances are your spawn was contaminated.  If your casing layer contaminated, increase fresh air exchange.  From the looks of what I see above, I'd suspect your problem originated at inoculation, or perhaps you didn't wash away all of the vermiculite filter from your cakes before spawning to bulk.  Remember, the tops of your jars are nasty if you're using a verm filter. Often, trichoderma or other molds will germinate and actually be growing in the verm filter, especially if you turned the jars upside down, which I don't recommend. Be sure to rinse the verm off under the faucet before spawning to bulk.<br />RR","title":"Re: Not sure ..."}}
