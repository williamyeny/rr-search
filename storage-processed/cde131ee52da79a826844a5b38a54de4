It's a well known fact that primordia for the first three flushes are set at the same time.  Sometimes the primordia are hidden under the casing layer out of sight, other times they grow into small pins that are visible, then become dormant until their time comes.  Removing non-aborted pins will substantially reduce future flushes.<br />RR"}}
