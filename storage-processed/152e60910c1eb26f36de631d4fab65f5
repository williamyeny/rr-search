Sterility is not important either as you don't dump your spawn out on the floor of the glovebox.  Just cut a couple of arm holes in your container, and either glue gloves or tyvek sleeves in place.  Soap and water is sufficient to clean a glovebox.  Don't use alcohol or lysol if you plan to use an alcohol flame to sterilize your needles/scalpel.  Just before making transfers, it helps to spray a few squirts with a fine mister(water only) as the mist will settle any contaminants that may be airborne inside the box.<br />RR","title":"Re: construction/sterilzation of glove box.....
