You can bring it home wet, as long as you pasteurize and use right away.<br />For straw, add one cup of hydrated lime to each ten gallons of 140F to 160F pasteurization water.  This will pasteurize your straw in a ph solution of 10 to 11.  Drain after pasteurization, but don't rinse.  As the mycelium colonizes the straw, the ph will drop.  This high ph at the start helps to ward off the green molds, which seem to consider straw their favorite food.<br />RR"}}
