They're not like cakes where you can dunk and keep going for flush after flush.  A cased substrate will deliver 80 to 90 percent of it's total after two flushes.  In my opinion, the fruiting chamber real estate is better served by placing a new tray in its place no later than after the third flush.   Why wait for trich to show up and ruin your future projects by sending trillions of spores everywhere just to get that last ten percent?<br />RR"}}
