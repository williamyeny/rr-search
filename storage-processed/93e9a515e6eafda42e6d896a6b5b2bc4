The wax paper also gets soggy after a day.  That's why I've always recommended replacing wax paper every two days ever since I first started recommending the procedure.  Wax paper will serve as a way to get a good micro-climate right against the casing layer to stimulate primordia formation, but don't try to make the mycelium only grow up through holes.  If you want that, use plastic.<br />RR"}}
