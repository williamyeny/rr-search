Cobweb(dactylium) rarely grows in jars.  If you have a grey mold in a sealed jar, it's usually something far worse than cobweb and the jar is toast.  Bury it in your yard in a shady spot and if it fruits later, the fruits are fine to eat.<br />Read up on and practice sterile procedures.  If you used a vendor supplied syringe and a glovebox, then flame sterilized your needle, you would be fine if you followed the pf tek.  Make sure your verm layer on top is totally dry.  Also note for the future there is a contamination forum.<br />RR"}}
