Don't skip the foil.  The lid of your pc is exposed to the cool air in your kitchen.  That means when the steam hits your lid, it will cool off, and condense back to water, where it will drip(rain) back onto the top of your jars.  If there is no foil, the water that rains down from the lid will leak into the jars, ruining your moisture content.<br />RR"}}
