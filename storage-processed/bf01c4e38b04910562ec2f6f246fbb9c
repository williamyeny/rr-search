They aren't necessary or even helpful on the mushroom crop.  Most of the time the gnats are just visiting, being drawn in by the sweet smell of the mycelium.  They don't eat much.<br />Fly paper seems to help, as does sticking the hose of your vacuum cleaner in there and sucking them out, which is actually kind of fun. You can put a flea and tick collar for dogs in the vacuum cleaner bag to make sure the gnats get killed when they arrive. They're a fact of summer, but not really a problem most of the time.  DE will help if it's dry.  You can even sprinkle it around the shelves, or try baiting them with a bit of honey on a piece of wax paper, surrounded by DE.<br />RR"}}
