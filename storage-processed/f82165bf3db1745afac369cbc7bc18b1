Remember, a wet filter will allow contaminants to colonize right through it.  If your metal lid has the recommended three to four 1/16\" holes, with tyvek over that, the jar won't dry out in the next two to three weeks.  I'd remove the foil and just set them on a shelf.  Next time, remember to wait until your inoculant is ready.<br />RR","title":"Re: Will these dry out?"}}
