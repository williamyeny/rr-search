The bottom one has too much glare from the flash.  Turn the flash off, and use a light or two from 45 degree angles on each side of the jar.  This will reflect the glare away from your camera lens, allowing you to get a clear picture.  Use a tripod or book, etc to set the camera on for stability so the picture will be clear.<br />RR","title":"Re: Newbie HELP! yellow/red growth"}}
