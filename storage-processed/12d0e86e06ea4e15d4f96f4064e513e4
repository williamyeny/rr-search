Bacteria grows very well in water, esp when combined with the nutes in a cake or casing.  We dunk in the fridge to slow down bacteria growth, not to cold shock.  Don't confuse the two. If you dunked at room temperature, your cakes would be almost sure to contaminate within a few days.  Cubies are a warm weather species and do not benefit from a cold shock.","title":"Re: My casing, whats wrong?"}}
