Never tried it yet, so can't vouch for whether it works or not.  I use sticky paper.  Works like a charm.  Place it near the entrances to your grow area, and also on the inside.  They're likely breeding in your houseplants too.  A good cure for both houseplants and casings with fruit flies is dunking.  A 24 hour dunk will drown them and their larvae.","title":"Re: fruit fly infestation"}}
