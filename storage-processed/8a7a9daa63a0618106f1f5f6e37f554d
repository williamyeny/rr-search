Don't incubate.  That's probably what's slowing down growth and causing problems.  Colonize at <i>normal room temperature</i> and they'll be finished by day 20.  Too many so-called 'teks' around here recommend 'incubating' for some silly reason, probably that incorrect figure of '86F is best for colonization' reported in a book from 20+ years ago.  Incubating makes about as much sense as 'total darkness', and 'dropping humidity after pins form'.<br />RR"}}
