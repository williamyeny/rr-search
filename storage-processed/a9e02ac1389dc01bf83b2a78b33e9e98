Flourescent is much better than 'light bulb' incandescent.  You want as close to 100% humidity as you can, and have lots of air exchange.  Be sure to mist the crap out of them after the dunk and roll to get the dry verm nice and wet.  After that, just mist as required to prevent them from drying out.<br />RR"}}
