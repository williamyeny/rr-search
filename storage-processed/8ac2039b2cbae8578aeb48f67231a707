It's not widely considered aesthetically pleasing, and it's one more thing to clean up after harvest. It won't harm you to eat it, but the chemical content is comparatively low.<br />Cause: The most common reason cited for this is excess humidity in the fruiting chamber. Why the elevated humidity makes this happen, I do not know. I would think it would be excess CO2 levels \"tricking\" the mycelium to start looking for food (think high CO2 during colonization), but since there is none left in the substrate, it goes up the mushrooms' stems.<br />Solution: If it's high humidity or gas levels, more FAE is the easy fix. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif\" alt=\":thumbup:\" title=\":thumbup:\"/></blockquote><br />Still, stale air is the cause of fuzz on the stems.&nbsp; It's not high CO2, or excess humidity, but you're correct that more fresh air is the cure.&nbsp; Fuzzy stems are a good indicator that mold will soon follow if one fails to increase fresh air supply.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cubensis Pinning Strategy & Troubleshooting"}}
