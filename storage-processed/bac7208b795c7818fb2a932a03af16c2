The bluing you see is bruising from the cakes starting to dry out.  You can pour some water on the top of the cake into the divot left by the shape of the jar.  Fill that up, and within a few hours it will absorb into the mycelium.  Repeat daily for a few days and your fruits will grow much larger.<br />The discoloration is metabolites, not <i>piss</i> which mushrooms don't make.  Before and after dunking, rinse the cakes under the faucet to remove anything that will wash off.  I'd suggest reading up on 'dunk and roll'.  Having a layer of verm on the outside of the cakes gives you something to mist daily, and then the verm will hold the moisture as a reservoir for the mycelium to draw from.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
