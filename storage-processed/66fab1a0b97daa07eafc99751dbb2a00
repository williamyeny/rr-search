Gypsum is an excellent buffer.  If you wish to bring the ph of your casings higher, you would want to use hydrated(water soluable) lime.  Limestone is for long term use, such as in a garden.  Casings, which flush for a month or so do not need long term ph adjustment.  They need short term, therefore hydrated lime is what you would want to use.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing ph buffers"}}
