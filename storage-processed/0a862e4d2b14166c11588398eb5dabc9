You want the metal lid with holes first(make the holes no more than 1/8\"), followed by the filter material, then the ring.  This keeps your filter on the outside of the jar where condensation doesn't get it wet.  Remember, if your filter gets wet, you're screwed.  Bacteria in the air will colonize right through the material as if it wasn't even there.  The reason for making the holes in the lid small is so that when you shake, the wet grains don't contact your filter material.  A wet, nutrient saturated filter is sure to contaminate.<br />Remember, when things look fine until you shake, then don't recover, it's almost always bacteria.<br />Your procedure for hydrating the grains sounds ok, but here's an additional test.  I call it the toilet paper test.  Put about a tablespoon of grains on a single sheet of toilet paper and leave them there for 15 seconds.  If the grains left a wet spot on the toilet paper, they're too wet.  If there is no wet spot after sitting on the sheet of toilet paper for 15 seconds, the grains are ready to be loaded into the jars.  Good luck.<br />That isn't 'water' in the bottom of the jars after a week.  It's mycelial metabolites produced in response to the bacterial contamination.  It's the mycelium's natural defense mechanism.  In nature, the metabolites can easily defeat the bacteria.  Unfortunately in jars, it seems to drain to the bottom where it can't do its job.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain blues - Still haven't got it sorted out"}}
