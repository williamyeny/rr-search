It should be available at any nursery or garden center.  If you can't find it, drywall(sheetrock) is made from gypsum.  You can get a sheet of it and smash with a hammer to get the gypsum out.  In fact, the garden gypsum I get at a nursery is a byproduct of the drywall industry.  It even has some of the white and brown paper mixed in.  Use gypsum at 5% or so by volume of the total amount of bulk substrate. You don't have to measure it exactly.  If you have twenty handfuls of manure, toss in a handful or two of gypsum.<br />If you're going to use the pillow case method of pasteurization, the substrate will already be more than hydrated.  I'd skip the inoculation slurry, and simply crumble the pf cakes in a baggie, then mix the chunks in.  Adjust your bulk substrate to field moisture capacity before spawning.  Field moisture capacity means a handful won't drip any water out from gravity.  However, if you squeeze it gently, a few drops will fall, and if you squeeze the handful forcefully, a small stream will run out.<br />When you mix the corncobs and cow manure, if the mixture seems heavy, cut it with some vermiculite and/or coir.  You want a nice, fluffy mix with lots of tiny air spaces that the mycelium can easily penetrate.  <br />Horse manure is better suited for mycology because if its texture.  Many new growers think we prefer horse manure over cow due to the nutritional benefits, but this is incorrect. In fact, bagged steer manure has more 'nutes' than horse manure, but cow/steer manure tends to pack down tight, causing the mycelium to have a hard time colonizing it. This can be corrected by adding vermiculite, coir, coffee grinds, cotton seed hulls, and in your case corncobs if they're abundant in your local area.  The more separate ingredients you add to your substrate the better.  Dried corn stalks can also be shredded and added to the substrate.  I wouldn't use them in the casing mix.  Stick to peat/verm with one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat, and one or two tablespoons of gypsum per cup of peat.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
