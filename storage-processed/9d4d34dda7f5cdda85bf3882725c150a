The problem most growers have is they forget to inflate the bag prior to sealing.  There needs to be a <u>plenum of air</u> in the top of the bag for it to work properly.   <br />After colonization, the grains or manure can be cased and fruited right in the bag by simply cutting three or four slits from the top of the substrate to the top of the bag for air exchange.  The filter is fine for <i>gas</i> exchange during colonization if the bag was inflated first, but you'll want to cut slits for <i><u>air</u></i> exchange upon full colonization.<br />RR"}}
