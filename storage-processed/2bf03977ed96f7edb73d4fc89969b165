Spawning to bulk would be pushing your luck to hope for a harvest before mid june if the bags are not ready right now.  I'd suggest either laying the grains out in a tray and casing without spawning to bulk, or putting them in the refrigerator at full colonization, and leaving them there until you return.<br />RR"}}
