If using an oven, that will probably take 2 hours.  My preferred method is to bring the moisture level of the casing or substrate material such as manure to field capacity, then load into quart jars.  Place in a large pot of cold water, with the water 2/3 to 3/4 up the jars.  An All American PC or large cast iron pot works well for this.  Cover and turn on the stove.  As soon as the water boils, turn off the stove, but leave the jars in the covered pot of water.  After an hour, the jars can be removed, and when cool, they're ready to use.<br />RR"}}
