The difference is in how much steam you vent.  Did you remember to leave the weight off for the first ten minutes or so of steam escaping to allow the contents of the PC to come up to temperature prior to building pressure?  If you missed that step, it can take an awfully long time, if ever, to come to pressure.  Also, make sure you don't have an excessive amount of water, as that will make it slow to pressurize.<br />RR"}}
