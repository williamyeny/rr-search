Thank you. </blockquote><br />You better get that saran wrap off and gets some air to your fruits, or you're going to have green molds very soon. The biggest cause of molds in colonized substrates is improper fresh air exchange. <br />If you have 4\" of damp, but not wet perlite in the bottom, it will maintain 95% to 99% humidity.  I have at least 50 holes drilled into my terrarium and it still maintains 95% humidity.  Here it is with a current grow of oyster mushrooms on pf cakes.  You can see all the holes and the hygrometer reading 97% in this picture.  All four sides and the bottom have holes just like the side you see facing you.  Also note the absense of condensation on the sides, meaning there is no temperature differential.  As anno said, condensation is temperature related, not humidity.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-005/054567909-pf_oysters_001a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-005/054567909-thumb_pf_oysters_001a.jpg\"></a>"}}
