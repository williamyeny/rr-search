It's also open rangeland, so we have cows, llamas, and horses everywhere for free manure, not to mention deer, elk, bear and mountain lions to complete the experience. <br />I'll be cutting a couple of mushroom caves into the side of our mountain over the winter.&nbsp; A neighbor has a huge mining backhoe on tracks like a tank, but he can't operate in the area(septic drain field) until this winter when the ground freezes.<br />Gonna cost a bit more than $1500 though. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />RR","title":"Re: If you got about $1500 to start the best grow ever..."}}
