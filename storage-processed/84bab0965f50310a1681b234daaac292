The endospores are mostly in the dust and chaff, so they rinse off and down the drain before you even begin the soak.<br />I'd look closely at your filter setup.  Bacteria is in the air all around us.  If your filter isn't sound, or if it gets damp, the bacteria will colonize right through it to the grains below.<br />Also, after the simmer, be sure to drain well, then toss the grains around in the collander so the steam can evaporate off.  The grains should appear and feel dry when you load the jars.  The moisture you need is inside the grains.  Any on the surface will run to the bottom of the jar within a few days after sterilization.<br />RR","title":"Re: I Spy: Contams"}}
