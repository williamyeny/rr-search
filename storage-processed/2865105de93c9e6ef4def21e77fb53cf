I got tired of replacing the $30 gauge every six months, and since I did the above, I've been running a cheapie gauge for several years now.&nbsp; I can lay the back of my fingers on the nipple just ahead of the gauge and it isn't even hot during the PC cycle.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"/forums/files/07-009/259775434-Lobster_night_1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/259775434-thumb_Lobster_night_1a.jpg\"></a>"}}
