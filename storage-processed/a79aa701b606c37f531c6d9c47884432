You can rinse and dunk in tap water.<br />The long stems are from lack of air exchange, and the very small caps are from reading bad advice around here about not needing bright light 12/12. An open cubboard probably only gets incandescent light, which is the absolutely worst type.  Mushrooms want bright, high frequency light such as natural sunlight, or fluorescent lamps with a color temperature above 5,000 Kelvin.<br />Correct those issues and your next flush will be great.  Soak the cakes for 24 hours a few days after you pick this flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's wrong with these cakes?"}}
