I just said to let it set for 2 hours before going to the next step.&nbsp; Now you know the reason.<br />Another question asked a lot is do you need to rinse the soap out.&nbsp; No, you don't.&nbsp; Simply lift the soapy straw, let it drain back into the soak tub, and then transfer to your pasteurization water.<br />Now that I grow commercially, I soak in a much larger barrel overnight, so have no need for soap.<br />RR"}}
