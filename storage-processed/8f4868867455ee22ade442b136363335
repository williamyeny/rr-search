Bacteria smell like garbage.<br />It 'looks' OK, but definitely the bag was exposed to higher than normal room temperature.  Metabolites are excreted in response to stress from competitor fungi and bacteria, both of which are stimulated by elevated temperatures.  Mushroom mycelium prefers a temp in the 72F to 78F range, with larger substrates like yours, you should reduce the temp even more due to the effects of thermogenesis.<br />RR"}}
