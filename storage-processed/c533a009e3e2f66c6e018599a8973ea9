That way you would have a consistent humidity, constant FAE and there wouldn't be pockets of grouped CO2</blockquote><br />You just described a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>.&nbsp; You don't need fans either.&nbsp; The lights create a slight warming in the growing area of a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; Warm air is less dense than cold air, thus the cool air entering from the bottom through the holes travels up through the damp perlite, cooling further by evaporative cooling.&nbsp; Remember, in nature air travels from high pressure to low, or from more dense air to less dense air. The warm air in the fruiting section rises, creating even more draft, drawing more dense air from the bottom up through the perlite, and the system repeats itself.<br />This provides humidity, fresh air exchange, disposal of CO2 gasses, and results in a perfect fruiting environment all on its own.&nbsp; The system is modeled similar to the supports on the Alaska Pipeline, one of my first engineering projects after college in the early 1970s.&nbsp; The supports must remain frozen 24/7 for 12 months of the year to keep them in the correct place on the tundra.&nbsp; Can you imagine the energy requirements and failure potential if 700 miles of support structure had to be cooled via electricity?&nbsp; The system is self-freezing based on the principle of gasses traveling from high pressure to low, and absorbing heat energy as they do.<br /><a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/6880451#6880451\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a><br />RR","title":"Re: Fruiting chamber ?'s"}}
