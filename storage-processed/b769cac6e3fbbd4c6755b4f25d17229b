Not only that, it didn't even raise the ambient humidity in the room by over 3%, making it a waste of money and little more than an annoying noise maker.<br />Build your own greenhouse with tubing and plastic sheeting.&nbsp; Don't admit to being lazy around here either, as it will cut down any advice you get.&nbsp; Growing mushrooms isn't for the lazy.&nbsp; They fail every time.<br />RR"}}
