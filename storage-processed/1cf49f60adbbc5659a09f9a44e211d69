My website server crashed, and since I had to build a new site anyway, I decided to re-encode our pf tek videos with the new codec.  They're much higher quality than the ones you've seen on youtube.<br />If you have trouble playing them, make sure you have flash player downloaded and intalled on your machine.<br />Each video is encoded in four separate bitrates.  When you click the link, our server tests your internet connection speed and selects the highest resolution version of the four that will stream seamlessly to your computer.  Dial up users will probably want to still use the youtube versions, if you can even get those.<br />I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know how they play and report any bugs. Thanks. <br />RR<br />(these links are subject to change as I build more of my site, but they're up for now)<br />pf tek part 1:  <a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/eddabfdc-97f8-4201-853a-1203531bb169.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/<wbr>eddabfdc-97f8-4201-853a-1203531bb<wbr>169.aspx</a><br />pf tek part 2: <a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/7a69a26c-3274-462e-b2a7-0d010f2856d8.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/<wbr>7a69a26c-3274-462e-b2a7-0d010f285<wbr>6d8.aspx</a><br />pf tek part 3:  <a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/4668b8fe-7c51-44cd-ac3d-1cb71528184f.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/<wbr>4668b8fe-7c51-44cd-ac3d-1cb715281<wbr>84f.aspx</a><br />pf tek part 4: <a href=\"http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/5ef65f4c-423c-41fe-9ae2-32e3236d6e96.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/<wbr>5ef65f4c-423c-41fe-9ae2-32e3236d6<wbr>e96.aspx</a>"}}
