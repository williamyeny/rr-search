It has holes drilled into ALL SIX SIDES and is NOT a sealed system.  It appears you're not just challenged by basic physics, but reading comprehension as well.  No terrarium should EVER rain down, and anything with holes in it is NOT sealed.  Stop posting and read for a change.  If you're not interested in reading to learn, then we can't help you.<br />RR","title":"Re: low RH in FC?"}}
