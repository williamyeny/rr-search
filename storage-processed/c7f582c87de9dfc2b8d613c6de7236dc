The wicking type of cool mists are the wrong type, and will actually lower the humidity in a mini-greenhouse over not using anything at all.  Get rid of that thing now.  A mini-greenhouse full of cased, bulk substrates will generally maintain proper humidity just from the evaporated moisture from the casing layers.  If your greenhouse isn't full, you can fill up the empty shelves with trays of moist perlite just as is done with a terrarium.  The evaporation from these trays will give you what you need at a lower cost.<br />The impeller type cool mists will emit a small stream of mist.  If you run them more than a few minutes however, water droplets will begin to form, which can then rain down on your substrates, causing problems.  I prefer to use very short cycling.  Run the cool mist for three to six minutes, then off for six to ten minutes.  This requires either a humidistat or a cycle timer such as are sold at hydro shops, but they are not cheap. Expect to pay over $100 for a good timer.  Consider it part of the cost of a hobby.  Be glad you're not into racecars, boats, or airplanes where every thing starts at $1000.  <br />There is a good use for the wicking type humidifier however.  Run it 24/7 in the room your greenhouse or terrarium is located.  This will bump the ambient humidity up, making it easier to maintain the desired level in your greenhouse.<br />Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: ULTRASONIC TIMER"}}
