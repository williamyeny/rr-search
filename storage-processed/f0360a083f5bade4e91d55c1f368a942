However, so many new mushroom growers come from weed growing where strain is everything, we keep the strain thread up there for them.  If not for the strain thread, at least 25% of our total posts would be about strains.  There used to be four or five strain threads on every page and all it does is clutter up the forum and waste bandwidth.<br />What we do is whenever the strain thread gets too full, such as now, we dump it and start another.  If everyone is in agreement to shitcan the current one, I can dump it in a day or two, and open a fresh one.  Save anything you consider worth saving before it goes away.<br />However, don't hold out hopes.  A brand new strain thread will soon look just like the old one, which is the third or fourth generation.<br />A subforum would just make people think that strains actually meant something.  The truth is, when two hyphae from spores meet and exchange genetic information, a strain is born.  Sometimes thousands of strains are born from a single squirt of spore solution, thus the name on the syringe often means little.<br />A few strains have beeen fairly well stabilized by mycologists, but consider that the fancier the name, the less likely it is to be anything else but some marketing trick someone made up.<br />RR"}}
