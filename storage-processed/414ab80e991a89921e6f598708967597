You can put it on a cycle timer so it exchanges air while you're sleeping or at work.  I have one of those self-contained air conditioners hooked up to my mini-greenhouse with the fan running 24/7.  The supply air comes in at the bottom right next to the humidifiers, and the return air is out the top so the prevailing draft carries the humidity all the way to the top.  It works like a charm.  When I need to cold-shock edibles, I simply fire up the compressor for a few days, but the blower runs 24/7 regardless.  It works perfect and the moving, fresh air keeps trich and cobweb from ever getting a chance.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fanning using a electric fan?"}}
