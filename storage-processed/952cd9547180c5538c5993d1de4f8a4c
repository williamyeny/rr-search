It won't hurt any pins or mushrooms that are growing.&nbsp; Another thing you can do is pour water right on top of the cake so it pools up.&nbsp; It should soak in within a few hours.<br />If you're using a plastic grid, you can probably skip the foil unless it's helping prevent the fruits from growing downward.&nbsp; Don't worry if the mushrooms form on the bottom of the cakes.&nbsp; Often that's due to moisture content, but sometimes it's just strain related.<br />RR","title":"Re: Chronically dry cakes in SGFC"}}
