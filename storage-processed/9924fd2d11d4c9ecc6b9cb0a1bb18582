Polyfill will allow the gas exchange that is required during colonization, but not air exchange, which is required during fruiting. During fruiting, the more air exchange the better, so I'd suggest removing the polyfill and leaving those holes open.  Of course, with the holes open, you need to ensure there is enough humidity to go along with that massive air exchange.  Just remember, it's a tightrope act.  Any parameter you change, effects the other parameters as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Polyfill and FAE"}}
