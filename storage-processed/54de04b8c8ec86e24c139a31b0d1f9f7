Trich mycelium is white, snow white.  Only the spores are green.<br />However, as for sterilizing verm, I do it when the bag has been opened for awhile.  If using a brand new bag, I usually don't bother.  It's easy to do by just putting the dry verm on a cookie sheet and baking in the oven.<br />RR"}}
