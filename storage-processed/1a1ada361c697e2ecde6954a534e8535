A 1\" layer works well.  Cover with aluminum foil and set on a shelf for three days or so until the mycelium has knitted itself back together.  Add 1/2\" layer of pasteurized casing material and cover again with foil.  Let that sit for a week or so until the casing layer is 2/3 or so colonized.  Remove the foil and expose to fruiting conditions.<br />RR"}}
