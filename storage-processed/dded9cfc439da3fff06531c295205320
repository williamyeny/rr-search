At some point you'll still have to transfer from unsterile cardboard to agar to clean up the culture before inoculating your grains.  I'd suggest simply starting with agar.  Gentmycin sulphate is autoclavable if you need a good antibiotic.<br />Pans are relatively easy to grow.  They like a thin manure substrate, either steer or horse, with a thin casing layer of peat/verm.  Try to keep the substrate to 1 1/2\" thickness, and the casing layer to 1/4\" thick.  Fruit at 80F in as close to 100% humidity as you can.  Good luck!<br />RR","title":"Re: High all iam Kocos."}}
