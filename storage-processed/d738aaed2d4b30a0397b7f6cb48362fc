Don't use a sealed jar, which traps moisture that is inside the cap, which amounts to 90% of its total weight.  Also, why PC the jar when you can't PC the mushroom itself?  I'd suggest taking prints on foil in a glovebox.  You can cover the cap while it prints with a sheet of tyvek for extra protection if desired.<br />RR"}}
