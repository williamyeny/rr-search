I'd stay away from popcorn as it's the worst possible choice for spawn.<br />Supplemented sawdust must be sterilized.  The wheat bran harbors bacterial endospores and must be pressure cooked.  If you fail to supplement the sawdust/woodchips, yields are greatly reduced.<br />You want to use jars or filter patch bags.  Jars are great for grain spawn, but bags are really the best practical choice for sawdust/chips.  I use the large, gusseted filter bags, and usually load them with around 17 to 20 cups of material.<br />My woodlover recipe:  This fills two large spawn bags.<br />15 cups hardwood sawdust<br />2 cups wheat or rice bran.  (wheat bran is much more economical)<br />1 cup gypsum.<br />15 cups moistened hardwood chips<br />Mix the dry ingredients together, then hydrate so the mixture sounds spongy when squeezed, but NO water comes out, even when you forcefully squeeze a handful.  If any water squeezes out, toss in another handful of dry sawdust.<br />When the above is prepared, mix with an equal amount by volume of moistened hardwood chips.  I soak the hardwood chips for 24 to 48 hours.  If soaking is not an option, boil them for one hour to hydrate.<br />Load the above into two large bags and sterilize for 90 minutes at 15 psi.  An AA 921 can hold four bags this size.<br />RR"}}
