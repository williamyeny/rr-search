Horse manure is free by the truckload, and coir is $3 for a small brick.   Adding a small amount of coir to a casing layer of peat/verm can give a nice boost.  It's about fungi food, not nutrition.  Many growers still tend to confuse the 'nutes' required for plants and carry it over to mushroom cultivation, but they're hardly applicable.   Few plants will grow on fresh sawdust, but mushroom mycelium thrives on it.  Few plants will grow on pure cow or horse manure, but mushrooms thrive on it.  Few plants will grow on pure coir(without supplementation), but mushrooms thrive on it.<br />Cubes, being the easiest of all mushrooms to grow, will grow on practically anything you spawn to.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-13/208962316-Bunny_006qa.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-13/208962316-thumb_Bunny_006qa.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Gypsum In Casing"}}
