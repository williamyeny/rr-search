Look at the above picture before  added the water.  The edges were curled up from being too dry.  I haven't seen that before from dishes that were less than several months old.  I will consider when growth of both organisms stopped and the dish became totally dry as the end of the experiment.  I know that dry reishi mycelium will start growing again after at least two years.  I don't know how long the contaminant would remain viable.<br />RR","title":"Re: Clash of the Titans"}}
