Ditto for storebought mushrooms that have been handled by everyone from housewives to the stockboy.   <br />Simply let a cap print for a few hours, then move to a new piece of paper or foil and let it continue dropping spores. Throw away the first print and use the second. It also helps to put the cap on a screen or something to avoid direct contact with the surface you're printing to.<br />The above being said, light from day one didn't contaminate your jars. I never make even the slightest attempt to keep colonizing jars in the dark.  That is 20 year old advice found in TMC which has since been disavowed even by paul.<br />73F also didn't cause your jars to contaminate.  I have incubated jars on a shelf at room temperature for years.  It may take a day or two longer, but bacterial contaminants are also stimulated by higher temperatures, so contamination is lower when you use lower temperatures.  Room temp is perfect, imo.<br />Contamination is caused by allowing contaminants to come into contact with your sterilized media.  The most common vector of contamination is you the grower.  The second most common is through the air.  Read up on the established teks and follow them to the letter, especially regarding sterile procedure.   Good luck<br />RR","title":"Re: Contam mushroom= Normal spore print?"}}
