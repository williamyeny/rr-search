Keep petri dishes at room temperature.  Don't incubate.  Parafilm is all you need.  I use four squares per dish and fold it in half lengthwise before wrapping, so it's two layers thick.  This prevents the sharp edges of the petri dish from tearing it over time.<br />A good trick for separating healthy mycelium from bacteria is to pour a fresh layer of hot antibiotic agar right over the top of the contaminated dish.  Completely cover the bacteria and mycelium with a fresh layer.  The hot agar seems to pasteurize the bacteria, which knocks it back for a few days, but doesn't bother the mushroom mycelium too much, which then grows right up through the agar to appear on top in a couple of days.  At the first sight of mycelium on top of the dish, take your scalpel and carefully shave a bit of the mycelium off without taking any of the agar itself.  Transfer the myc you shaved to a new dish, and let it grow.  <br />If the bacterial contamination was especially bad, such as in your first pic of the last series above, you might want to repeat the procedure one more time just to make sure.  Sometimes bacterial rods can attach to the mycelium as it grows and travel with it.<br />RR"}}
