A jar of colonizing mycelium will be considerably warmer than the surroundings.&nbsp; I've seen up to a twenty degree temp difference in large spawn bags of colonizing mycelium, and ten degrees above ambient by shooting IR at quart glass jars.&nbsp; These temps are in relation to the surrounding air, thus the temperature inside the glass jar is going to be more than ten degrees higher than the ambient temp outside the jar.&nbsp; Hopefully, you're not calling a tote(which I recommend against) an enclosed thermal system.<br />My new underground mushroom farm colonization area is only about 25% full at this point(+/- 400 substrate blocks), but I'm already having to keep the window open to keep the temps below 80F, even though it's well below freezing outside, and the only source of heat is the colonizing substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: how long for full colonization of half pint substrate jars"}}
