This tub has four or five inches of depth. They are Pan Cyan Hawaii from sporeworks and NOT goliath.</blockquote><br />I say thin substrates of 1 1/2 inch because most people are growing in small trays or baking pans.&nbsp; If you're growing in a large container such as 50 gallons or a kiddie pool, a thicker substrate still has the same depth to area ratio, which is key.<br />If you tried to use four to five inches of substrate in a baking dish, copes would have a hard time fruiting, if at all.<br />To the original poster, you should always pasteurize indoor substrate and casing mixes.&nbsp; If growing outdoors, you can use it unpasteurized unless it's coir, which should always be pasteurized.&nbsp; Mycelium has a hard time digesting unpasteurized coir.&nbsp; The heat seems to make it more digestible.<br />RR","title":"Re: What is your experience with unpasturized and/or monotub Pan Cyan bulk substrate and casing?"}}
