Straw has a very short life expectancy after hydration and pasteurization.  By the time somebody could get it shipped, it would be too late to complete colonization before contamination set in.  Straw would need to be shipped dry, but at five to eight dollars per 70 pound bale in most areas, it would be hard to justify shipping, which would cost that much for a pound or two.<br />Sawdust needs to be supplemented with bran to be of much use as a growing medium, thus needs to be sterilized, not pasteurized.  If you don't supplement sawdust, performance is poor at best. <br />I'd get rid of the poll and just ask your questions.  Personally, I think all the polls around the forum are lame, but that's just me.  Others disagree.<br />RR","title":"Re: Would like to become a vendor - require your input!"}}
