The simpler the better, so forget the fans and timers.  Personally however, I see no reason for the polyfill either.  I leave my fruiting environment wide open so the air can flow in and out at will.  Natural circulation will provide your air exchange, and I've never found a need to filter or otherwise clean the air entering a fruiting chamber.  Trichoderma won't grow in an environment with fresh, circulating air.<br />RR"}}
