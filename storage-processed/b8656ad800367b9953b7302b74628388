I just drive there once or twice a year and get all I need.   If they don't ship, you can order hydrated lime from <a href=\"http://www.doitbest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.doitbest.com</a>    Just type in 'hydrated lime' in their search feature when you get to the website.  Get the five or ten pound bags, but not the 25 because it's made from dolomite lime.<br />RR"}}
