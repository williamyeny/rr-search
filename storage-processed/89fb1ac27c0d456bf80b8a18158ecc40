You can then lift the lid of the jar and pour these few drops right in.  If you're using the pf tek, you'll have to use some other sort of filter, such as synthetic filter disks so the solution can be poured right onto the substrate.<br />A better idea though is to go to a computer printer store.  They have ink refill syringes that have blunt tip needles that work fine.  The needles are dull and can't be used for drug use, so they should be available everywhere.  Boil the whole thing for 20 minutes to sterilize it.<br />RR"}}
