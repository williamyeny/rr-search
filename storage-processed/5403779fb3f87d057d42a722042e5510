You likely waterlogged your substrate, then in the high humidity of the monotub that moisture had nowhere to go.  Remember, your substrate needs to be <i>losing</i> moisture in order to get the best pinset.  A waterlogged substrate will perform poorly, as people who have set their cakes directly on perlite in a terrarium can attest.<br />RR"}}
