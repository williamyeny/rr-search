The important thing to remember is that you don't isolate a single strain.  You isolate as many of them as you possibly can down to single sectors, then fruit each one separately to determine which one(s) have the characteristics you're looking for.<br />Remember, once isolated, a strain can be used for many years without degradation by making master slants and storing in a clean lab refrigerator.<br />RR"}}
