First, get trays of perlite to catch the drips so they can return the excess moisture to the air as humidity.  Second, calibrate your hygrometer.  I have a greenhouse the size of three marthas and two vicks coolmists inside running one to two minutes on, five minutes off, provide a humidity in the mid 90's.  I suspect your humidity is fine and your hygrometer is off.<br />You also need to open it up more for FAE.  Don't count on a humidifier to provide it.  Use your humidifier for humidity and vents for air exchange.<br />RR"}}
