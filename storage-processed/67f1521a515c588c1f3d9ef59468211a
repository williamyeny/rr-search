Light<br />2. Heat<br />3. PH<br />4. Humidity<br />5. CO2<br />i wonder if any of you have more ideas regarding sensors or perfect values for those sensors..</blockquote><br />Certainly.<br />Toss all that stuff out and build a simple <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a>.&nbsp; If you provide proper air exchange, you don't need the CO2 detector, and if you use perlite, you'll have mid to upper 90% humidity.&nbsp; A light on a 12/12 timer will give what you need, or you can simply turn on the light switch when you get up and turn it off later.&nbsp; Mushrooms commonly grown here all fruit best at normal indoor room temperature, so you don't need the heat.<br />Every new grower with a background in either mechanics or electronics wants to automate his terrarium.&nbsp; The fact is, these creatures evolved in nature, which isn't controlled by mankind.&nbsp; It's very simple to get nature to 'automate' your terrarium, and you don't need sensors, fans, microprocessors, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fully Automatic FC - need your help."}}
