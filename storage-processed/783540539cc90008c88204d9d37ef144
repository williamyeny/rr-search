Look at them like a flexible jar, only larger.  Other names they're sometimes called are 'filter patch bags', 'spawn bags', 'gusseted poly bags', and a few others. 'Mycobags' don't colonize-what's inside them does. You'll still need to mix substrate and pressure cook.  If you don't have a pressure cooker, stick to 1/2 pint jars and the pf tek, even it that isn't what you wanted to hear.<br />RR","title":"Re: Downsides of mycobags? / Clarification questions"}}
