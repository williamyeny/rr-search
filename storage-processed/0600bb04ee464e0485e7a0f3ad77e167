You'll see detergent pasteurization, lime pasteurization, and bleach pasteurization and the yields from each as compared to normal steam pasteurization.&nbsp; I see no problem with your plan, other than you might need to add extra detergent or bleach.&nbsp; Read the whole paper before deciding which route to take.<br />RR"}}
