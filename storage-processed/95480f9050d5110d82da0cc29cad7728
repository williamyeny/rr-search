Until then, people will continue to expose their jars to high temps and wonder why they get moldy or bacterial infected projects.  <br />Thermogenesis causes the internal temperature of your substrate to be up to several degrees warmer than the surrounding air. If your air temp is 85 to 86, your jars are 90+ on the inside, and will be much more likely to contaminate than if the air temp is 75 to 80. If you're comfortable in a room with a t-shirt on, your jars will be happy in the same room.  No incubator or other means of heating is necessary.<br />RR","title":"Re: temp change during colonization"}}
