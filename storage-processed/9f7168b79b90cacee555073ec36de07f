I also think peroxide is horribly overrated for agar work. It does a good job of 86'ing cobweb on a casing layer, but isn't much good in my experience preventing bacteria on agar. I have some oyster and reishi clones that were taken from wild fruits earier in the week that I dipped in peroxide for five minutes before putting on agar and all six dishes are growing bacteria, not mycelium. You can also dip clones into a 5% bleach solution, and get much better results than peroxide for bacteria and mold spores.<br />RR"}}
