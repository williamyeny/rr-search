If it can produce that 265 cubic feet per minute at 1\" of static pressure, it will provide 132.5 linear feet per minute from a 12\" X 24\" HEPA filter that is rated for 1\" of static pressure.<br />The math is:  12\" X 24\" equals 2 square feet.  That means a 2 cfm blower would push 1 cubic foot of air through each of those 2 square feet of filter area.  Therefore, a 265 cfm blower would push 132.5 cubic feet of air through each of those two square feet, or easier stated an airflow of 132.5 lineal feet per minute, which is perfect.  The above does not take into account effeciency or losses from bends or a prefilter, which are likely to be no more than 15%.<br />My flowhood bends a bic lighter flame over between 45 and 90 degrees, but doesn't blow it out, and it flows at 100 linear feet per minute.<br />RR","title":"Re: Laminar Flowhood Q's"}}
