Of course, they've lost their vigor so I won't use them to expand the mycelium, but only to get a flush so I can get prints to start over.  It's a great way to save a strain.  I have a dedicated small fridge in my lab that is only used for mycology and kept at 35F.<br />You can't do g2g forever.  I never do more than two, then fruit.  Commercial growers go for three, but they have stainless steel walls and concrete floors that can be power washed every day.  The rest of us have wall to wall carpet, dogs and cats, moldy fruit in the kitchen, etc.  Clones of clones of clones, etc., also run out of vigor.  Remember, a clone is the same mycelium, and it can only divide cells so many times before it kicks the bucket.<br />RR","title":"Re: grain 2 grain storage"}}
