Bear in mind, that's just a short sample clip from the full tek on DVD. <br />I still use that method, sterilizing outdoors, and then carry the sterilized, but unsealed bags in a wheelbarrow across the back lawn into the house.&nbsp; The tyvek sleeve keeps the contents sterile until you pull the sleeve out for inoculation in your glovebox or flow hood area.<br />RR"}}
