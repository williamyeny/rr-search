Mix the dry ingredients, less the verm, and hydrate.&nbsp; Then mix in the hydrated verm and as a final step, adjust to field capacity and pasteurize.<br />Next time, cover your grains with the casing layer, put foil over the top, and let it colonize for a few days at normal room temperature. <br />RR","title":"Re: Cannot Find Answer.
