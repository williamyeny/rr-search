Mycelium will generally grow aggressively for several months.  Your isolations will be done within a month to six weeks.  At that point, save all your strains in the refrigerator to stop growth(more accurately-slow the growth way down).  When the cells stop dividing, the road to senescence gets much longer.  This means that two years from now, you can pull a master slant out of the refrigerator and it will realistically only have that original six weeks worth of cell divisions on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: cloning and strain isolation"}}
