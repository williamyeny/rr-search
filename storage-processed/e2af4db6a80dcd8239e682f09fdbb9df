This makes the relative humidity in the lower and middle areas of the chamber to be high, and lower in the upper parts.</blockquote><br />You have the physics incorrect.<br />The area where the perlite is has a slightly higher pressure relative to the fruiting chamber itself.&nbsp; The chamber is at a lower pressure than the perlite, thus the air travels up through the perlite, cooling and absorbing moisture as it travels.<br />In addition, the physics doesn't support your slits on top over holes all over.&nbsp; The reason is that moist air is already less dense than dry air, thus it naturally rises. You don't want it to rise and escape. With the holes all over the sides and roof, turbulence is created in the fruiting chamber, and more air is brought in and out.&nbsp; You don't want a chimney effect.<br />RR"}}
