Ground oyster shells are great for texture, but will do little to raise ph.<br />I prefer to use hydrated lime at the rate of 1 teaspoon per cup of peat moss.  Use gypsum at a rate of up to ten percent the amount of peat, so ten liters of peat and ten liters of vermiculite would require one liter of gypsum.<br />Any method you use to raise ph is fine.  There is no single 'correct' way as many substances will raise ph.   The biggest reason I prefer hydrated lime is that it is water soluble so it goes to work right away, which is the most critical time.  <br />The only reason we raise ph is to make our casing layer non-hospitable to molds such as trichoderma.  Your mushrooms would grow just fine without liming at all.  The problem is that molds prefer an acidic ph, which is what you get with peat moss or coir.  Molds won't grow in a ph of 8 or above, while mushroom mycelium can easily tolerate a ph of 8.<br />If you don't have a reliable way of measuring ph, I'd suggest just finding hydrated lime and using it at the one teaspoon per cup.
