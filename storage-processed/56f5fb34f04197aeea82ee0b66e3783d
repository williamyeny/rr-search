Just let them colonize at room temperature guys.  It will work fine.  They might colonize a bit faster at 80 than at 70, but 70 still works just fine for bulk substrates with FAR fewer problems.  At 80 degrees air temperature, my probe shows 87F in the center of the manure during colonization.  Running high temperatures is only asking for thermophilic bacteria and molds to activate and ruin your project.  Lower temperatures favor mushroom mycelium, higher temperatures favor contaminants.
