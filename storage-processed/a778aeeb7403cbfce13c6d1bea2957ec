However, it gives no indication of <i>how much humidity</i> was in the air. That moisture is no longer in suspension, because the surface of the terrarium has reached the dew point.&nbsp; This happens most often when the lights are turned on, because the greenhouse effect warms the air in the terrarium(reducing RH by the way) to the point where the dew point is reached on the surface, thus forming condensation.&nbsp; Using a shotgun terrarium generally eliminates this condensation problem by exchanging air across the temperature differential, thus canceling the temp swing.&nbsp; It's the entire basis of how the shotgun terrarium works.<br />The presence of condensation is not an indicator of high humidity within the terrarium.&nbsp; I still fail to see how this <b>crap you've absorbed from reading too many RR posts</b> is such a hard subject to grasp. This isn't advanced science. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR"}}
