You'll need them when inoculating your spawn jars.  That's the only area where sterility is important.   I live in a small, mold infested old condo building with wall to wall carpeting and a leaky roof, that causes black mold to grow on the ceilings.  Trust me, you can grow in all that just by following sterile procedure when you do your agar or grain/brf work.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Alternative air filtration system"}}
