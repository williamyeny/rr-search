I need some fresh cultures for a follow up video I'm getting ready to film on recycling with fungi.  I had several two month old fully colonized jars that had been sitting on my shelf left over from a previous project and they look pretty and white. However, I'm cooking up a fresh batch of agar as I type, and I'm going to get test tube cultures out of the refrigerator and inoculate petri dishes in the morning and start over fresh.  It's not only for reasons of contaminants, but also to get the very best possible rapid growth and performance.<br />If I use those jars and it works, I will save a month.  If I use them and it doesn't work, I'll loose that month, plus the time it takes to start over again at that time, putting me two months behind schedule.  It's not worth the chance, in my experience.<br />RR"}}
