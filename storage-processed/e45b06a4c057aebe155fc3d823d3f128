I've tried all sorts of substrates, and all sorts of additives and have never found a magic bullet that I can add to a substrate that will make potent mushrooms every time.<br />I can make very pretty mushrooms(brf), and very large mushrooms(straw), and lots and lots of mushroooms(horse manure). Horse manure in my experience is one of the best bases to start with.  Not due to any potency increase, but due to having almost the perfect texture and makeup.<br />Potency is all over the scale between mushrooms on the same cake or casing, between one flush as opposed to the next or the one before, and each time you use the 'strain' by multispore inoculations into future projects.  Sometimes earlier flushes are more potent, sometimes later flushes are. There seems to be no rule or pattern. <br />Just make your mushrooms happy and leave the rest to them.  If you don't feel they're potent enough, simply eat more.<br />RR"}}
