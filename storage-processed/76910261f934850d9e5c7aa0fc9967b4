Both mushroom <i>and</i> mold mycelium grow best in a pH of around 5.5 to 6, but since mushroom mycelium can tolerate the higher pH, we do that so our casing layer favors it over molds.  I use 1 teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  Don't figure the verm when calculating lime.   Use gypsum at 5% to 10% by volume of the amount of peat.  In other words, for ten cups of peat, use 1/2 to 1 cup of gypsum. As said above, always mix the dry ingredients first, then add water.<br />Gypsum, as I said, prevents swings in either direction, but the commercial growers long ago realized that it also increases disease resistance and also increases the size of the mushrooms by providing valuable trace nutrients and minerals.<br />RR","title":"Re: Balancing Ph? *confused as hell*"}}
