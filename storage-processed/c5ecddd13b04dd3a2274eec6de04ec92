Leave the spore solution all in one spot so the monokaryons can find compatible hyphae nearby and do the sex thing.  Once you have solid white mycelium growing, those are the dikaryons and they grow much faster than the wispy, greyish monokaryons that emerge from the spores. Many new growers mistake these for cobweb mold and toss out perfectly good projects because they shake at inoculation. <br />If you shake the bag or jar early, you force the slow growing monokaryons to colonize much more of the substrate before finding a mate, thus slowing down the progress.  I'd recommend giving the first and only shake at 30% colonization.<br />You didn't say what size bag you're using either.  Mycological spawn bags come in several sizes, with the ones I use holding nearly 40 cups of product when only 1/2 full.  I use ten ml per bag.  That would be a whole syringe.  If your bags are smaller, adjust the amount of course.<br />RR"}}
