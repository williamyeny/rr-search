My crappy light I mean 1w per square foot. This is not a plant and as long as you have more than 2 to 3 hours of light you are good. </blockquote><br />It's not just about initiating a pinset.&nbsp; There was some very poor information in a popular book from 25 years ago and people keep parroting it as if it was handed down by Moses on Mt Sinai.&nbsp; The author corrected his bad info in subsequent books, but nobody seems to buy those, or read them if they do.<br />By providing a 12/12 lighting schedule with bright, high frequency light such as natural daylight fluorescent or LED, you get a BETTER pinset, fatter and meatier caps, with shorter stems and more finished weight, plus healthier, more aggressive mycelium.&nbsp; Light is NOT about which way is up. That information is provided to the mycelium by gravity.&nbsp; The mushrooms use the light all the way to harvest, and scientifically, we probably don't know exactly <i>why</i> yet, but the fact remains they do.&nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants, but they still need light and benefit from a full day of light for <i>best results</i>.<br />RR","title":"Re: A little help with pics"}}
