To do otherwise is just wasting time.&nbsp; Jars don't break in the warm up phase, they break in the cooldown if you release the pressure instead of letting the PC cool naturally.&nbsp; They'll also break if you pack them in tight, not allowing room to expand. Another cause of breakage is sealed jars.&nbsp; You must provide filtered vents in the lids. You don't need more than an inch of water in the bottom of the PC.&nbsp; The jars are on a shelf or trivet above the bottom of the PC, so the stove heats the water and the water then makes steam which heats the jars.&nbsp; I always start with cold water, but within five to ten minutes steam is escaping and ten minutes after that I close the valve or put the weight on to build pressure.<br />Where you're getting your moisture content screwed up is by rinsing after the boil.&nbsp; One of the main functions of the boil is to get the grains hot so they'll steam off the excess moisture from their surface.&nbsp; Rinsing defeats the purpose.&nbsp; After rinsing, the grains cool off, and the water sticks to them by adhesion, no matter how long you let them 'drain'.&nbsp; No water drips out after the first three or four minutes.<br />Follow the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">grain prep tek</a> on my website or find where I've posted it here.&nbsp; That will get your moisture content perfect.&nbsp; After that, follow proper PC procedure which means to be sure to let all the air vent from the PC before placing the weight on, and then to follow proper sterile procedure after the grains are sterilized.<br />RR"}}
