It ain't worth pissing at each other over. I live in BFE, so it's easier to use synthetic filter disks since I can use them over and over.&nbsp; If you live in a city near craft stores, you can get all sorts of cool stuff.&nbsp; If a fabric is loose, pack it down tighter.&nbsp; The bottom line whatever you use can't melt or distort enough to allow bacteria or mold spores to enter, but must still allow the gasses to vent.&nbsp; It also must be synthetic to prevent becoming food.<br />RR"}}
