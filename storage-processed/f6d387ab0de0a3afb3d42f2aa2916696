A few pf cakes on jar lids usually doesn't hurt, but a tray blocks evaporation.  Simply put down a screen of hardware cloth to elevate the trays.  You should also take your fingers and rake deep into the perlite, so it's nice and fluffy and irregular on the top.  That gives the most surface area exposed to the air in order to evaporate the most amount of moisture.  Holes in all six sides of the container will help, as will clear tubs so light can penetrate.<br />RR"}}
