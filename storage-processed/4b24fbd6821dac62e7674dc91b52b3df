Fans, fanning, open vents or doors are for air exchange.  I have openings cut all over my greenhouse so air can circulate in and out top, bottom, and sides.  Constant air exchange, with the humidifier inside the greenhouse gives excellent performance.  I can actually maintain 99% humidity, just like a terrarium.<br />RR"}}
