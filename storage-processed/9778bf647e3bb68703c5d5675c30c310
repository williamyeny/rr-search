Molds are killed by much lower temperatures.  Bacterial endospores require a higher temperature than boiling to kill off and that's the problem with using an oven.  It's impossible for water to be at a temperature above 100c/212f without being under pressure.  Since the oven isn't under pressure, once the interior of the grains reaches 250f, all the moisture will by the laws of physics, be gone.  <br />RR"}}
