I think you're confusing incubators with fruiting chambers.  A fish tank pump will not deliver anywhere near the air exchange you need, especially with an upside down aquarium for the fruits to sit.  The air above will stagnate.<br />All you need is to put damp perlite in the bottom of one of the  aquariums, then put your cakes in on foil or jar lids.  cover loosely with whatever you have, but allow air to exchange.  Save the other one for when your projects outgrow the first one.<br />RR"}}
