Wax paper is water permeable</blockquote><br />That's news to me.&nbsp; How does water permeate wax?&nbsp; <br />I've been using and recommending wax paper for years simply because it's NOT water permeable.&nbsp; Of course, since one wrinkles it up and then flattens it back out again, this damages the wax coating somewhat so it should be replaced with a fresh sheet every two or three days.<br />RR"}}
