Also, during colonization, it helps to be able to stack jars several high, and you really should have the metal lids in place to to do that.<br />However, the key to avoid water entering during boiling is to elevate the bottom row of jars out of the water, and micropore tape over the holes in the metal lids keeps condensation from finding a way into the jars.&nbsp; Foil then adds an extra layer of protection, thus padding your bet.<br />RR"}}
