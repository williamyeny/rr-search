(assuming you use a square bin)  It takes 2 weeks to colonize the straw, then two weeks or so to colonize the casing.  With logs, they're pinning in two weeks, and the flush is over in 3 to 3 1/2 weeks.  Also, the full surface of the log fruits, even the very bottom where it's up against the shelf: the mushies just force their way out!  This method will deliver AT LEAST twice the fruits of a casing, in half the time.  Just follow the tek and don't add manure, compost, etc. ","title":"Re: Everbody head on over to mycotopia"}}
