A young mushroom has extremely fast growing mycelium due to rapid cell divisions.  An old, mature fruit has already reduced or shut down the metabolic processes.  I find it's best to clone a few fruits from a rapidly growing cluster or two, then allow the rest to mature.  By labeling your petri dishes, you can go back to an earlier stage of the best performers.  It's the best of both worlds, just a bit more work.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cloning a pin"}}
