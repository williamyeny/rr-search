When the bushings wear out, they get loud.  You're most likely running a hose from the humidifier, which creates a very small amount of static pressure, forcing wet, misty air into the motor bushings.  Run the humidifier without any modifications and it will stay quiet for years.<br />I don't believe in using a mechanical device prone to failure for air exchanage.  Just leave your door or lid loose for constant air exchange.  Use a humidifier for humidity in a greenhouse or perlite to maintain humidity in a terrarium unless your casing bulk substrates which will make enough humidity on their own in a terrarium.<br />RR"}}
