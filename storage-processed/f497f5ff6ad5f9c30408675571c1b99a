This is why posts from several years ago have me recommending that much. However, I've now cut that down to less than 5% by volume or around 2% by weight, and still get the same benefit.&nbsp; The idea is to use as little as possible, while still getting maximum benefit.<br />If it's labeled agricultural gypsum, it's generally ground from solid rock.&nbsp; The 'ingredients' are just what's there.<br />RR"}}
