Avoid misting while fruits are forming. </blockquote><br />Advice like this is what causes many grows to fail.&nbsp; Misting is <b>required</b> from birthing to the day of harvest.&nbsp; Mushrooms grow best in 99% humidity, and that means rain if they're outdoors, or misting if growing indoors.&nbsp; Mushrooms pop up outdoors after a rain, so mist several times per day.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />I havent been misting much at all ... I've misted up into the air and let the fine water particles fall down into the FC because I read that direct misting may also cause bruising.</blockquote><br />That's fine, but do it several times per day.&nbsp; What kind of light is that?&nbsp; The reason for a drop in humidity during the day is due to a temperature rise inside the terrarium.&nbsp; If your temp goes up 20F degrees, your humidity will be cut in half.<br />I ask about the light because I suspect it's producing heat, which is raising the temp in your tub.&nbsp; If it's a CFL, raise it up a bit to make sure the temps don't rise inside.&nbsp; If it's an incandescent, get rid of it and replace with a fluorescent.<br />RR"}}
