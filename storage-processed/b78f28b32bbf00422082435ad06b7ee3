The captain has decided to take a little time-out.  There is a big difference between providing moisture to the air, which is vapor, and continuing to apply moisture to <i>already saturated</i> air, which then essentially 'rains' on whatever is below.  This has been explained to him so many times, half the members here have worn the letters off their keyboards.<br />Members are more than welcome to post questions, and the other members will be more than happy to explain things.  However, once in a while someone comes along who just simply can't get it, no matter how many times things have been explained.  For those people there is no other option than the door.  We can't have the forum disrupted by constant flaming and nit-picking, especially by someone who doesn't understand the most basic principles of mycology or physical science.  Good luck to all, and I apologize to the new members for the drama created by his trolling.<br />RR","title":"Re: Perlite FC with an Ultra Sonic for misting."}}
