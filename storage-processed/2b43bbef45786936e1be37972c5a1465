It's superior to cow manure and nearly as good as horse.  In fact, lots of growers use coir to fluff up their manure or other compost.  I do not recommend using coir in a casing layer, although many growers do.  In my opinion, the best casing mixture is peat/verm.   I'll bet that coir compost would make an excellent substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: coco coir"}}
