You should be getting near perfect success, once you figure out where the bacteria is coming from. I doubt it's the swamp cooler unless you left it running while you did sterile work in front of the flowhood.&nbsp; Is your flowhood in a small room with a tight fitting door?&nbsp; If not, put it in one.&nbsp; By running the flowhood for an hour before you start work, the air in a small room should be completely clean.&nbsp; Be sure to shut off all fans, humidifiers, etc., other than the flowhood before starting work.<br />One of the biggest causes of bacteria in petri dishes is the fingernails of the cultivator.&nbsp; You can't wash with soap, alcohol, peroxide, etc., enough to get the bacteria out from under your fingernails.&nbsp; Always use gloves. <br />The exhaled breath of the cultivator is another major vector of contamination.&nbsp; If you fail to control your breath with a surgical mask, you can easily exhale at a greater velocity than the flowhood, thus sending your bad breath right into the petri dishes. Watch the video clips on my site covering agar and strain isolation to get tips on how to hold your hands when using a flowhood.<br />RR","title":"Re: Baffled by Bacteria?"}}
