You'll want something a bit taller when you start doing grain to grain transfers.  You don't want a fan or filter or anything else.  Gloveboxes are not sterile and not intended to be.  They are for still air.  Any fan will cause turbulence which will cause more problems than it fixes.  Just clean the inside with soap and water and go to work.<br />RR"}}
