I use lids with the rubber side up exclusively because they're so much easier to get off that way.  Your holes in the lid will provide air exchange and the air will take the path of least resistance which is through the holes.  It matters little with pf jars anyway because the verm barrier is your filter.  Whether the air exchanges through the holes or through the gap around the lid matters little.  Good luck!"}}
