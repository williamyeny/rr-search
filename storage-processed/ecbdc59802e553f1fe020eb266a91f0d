If you feel bad about \"Wasting\" myc, you could always toss that colonized dry layer into a compost pile and attempt to start an outdoor grow with it.</blockquote> I am scratching my head about that advice. I started out growing casings so I look at things a little differently. Your jars look fine, washing and scraping seems like the wrong route to go. I believe you can just roll those bad boys in verm after full colonization. <b>A trusted cultivater will probably chime in and I would listen to that advice.</b> I have seen some beautiful cakes on this site. Relax and enjoy.</blockquote><br />Yup, listen to that advice.&nbsp; Wash/scrape the dry verm layer off, colonized or not.<br />RR","title":"Re: mycelium pushing through dry verm"}}
