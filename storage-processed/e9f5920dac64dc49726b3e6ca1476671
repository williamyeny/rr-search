The temperature inside the center of the substrate in a jar is still not much over room temperature when the water surrounding it begins to boil.  That's why we bring the water to a full boil when our substrate or casing material is being heat treated in jars.<br />Sealed jars do not explode in a pressure cooker unless somebody does something dumb like release pressure at the end of the cycle instead of letting the unit cool slowly and naturally.<br />A kettle of boiling water will not exceed 212F/100C, thus no steam pressure is developed within the jar.  There may be a bit of air pressure as the contents expand, but not nearly enough to ruin the jars.  I've used the above described method thousands of times, so this isn't a theory, it's fact.<br />RR"}}
