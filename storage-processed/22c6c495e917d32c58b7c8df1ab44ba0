Mixing it at one to one or even two to one really is still an extremely small substrate and shouldn't be considered as bulk.  To get performance from any bulk substrate, use them at three or four to one, and with straw, you'll need to go ten to one to have much success.<br />If you're going to use it at one to one, you can easily skip any form of heat treating.  Just use a bit of lime and up to ten percent gypsum and go for it.<br />RR"}}
