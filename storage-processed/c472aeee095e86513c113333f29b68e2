A PC is best, but if you can't afford one, boil much longer.  <br />That being said, since the mold is originating from the injection sites, the mold was introduced at inoculation.  It' extremely important to use a glove box, flame sterilize your needle until it's red hot, then squirt out a bit of solution to cool the needle before injecting it into your jar.
