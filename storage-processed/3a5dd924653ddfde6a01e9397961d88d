I suspect the latter is a 40 watt or so CFL.<br />The bottom line is to use the brightest light you can get which doesn't heat up your grow area excessively.&nbsp; A few minutes of direct sun each day is a godsend if you can swing it.&nbsp; Mycelium uses light as an energy source, not in the way plants do, but in its own way.<br />RR"}}
