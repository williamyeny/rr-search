I got a whole tractor-trailer load of straw delivered to my place way out in BFE for $700. The only reason for using coir in this hobby is if you live in the middle of a concrete jungle with no way out.&nbsp; In fact, even downtown Seattle has a feed store with 60 pound bales of straw for $6.<br />Check feed stores in your local area.&nbsp; I've used wheat, oat, barley and rice straw with success.<br />RR"}}
