That's only the top layer.  You want to soak the entire substrate AND casing.  Using the faucet with gently running water is the way to do it.  The moving water prevents bacterial buildups and actually helps to wash away contaminant spores that may have landed on the project during the previous flush.    Soaking does not cause contamination.<br />RR"}}
