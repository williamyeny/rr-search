The shotgun terrarium solves both problems, and it works.<br />You don't artificially heat a terrarium.&nbsp; If you do, the interaction of the warm moist air inside with the cooler air on the outside, causes condensation on the walls, which STEALS the humidity, thus drying out the air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun terrarium modification: Introducing extra warmth & humidity"}}
