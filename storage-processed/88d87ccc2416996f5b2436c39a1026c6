Don't dunk in coffee.<br />You can use your spent coffee grinds mixed in with the straw if you want a boost, but using liquid coffee is much more likely to encourage mold than mushroom mycelium.  When using liquid coffee, it must be kept in sterile conditions until fully colonized.  That's why I only recommend using coffee to hydrate grains, which are then sterilized and colonized in a sealed, filtered jar.   <br />If you doubt this, just leave a cup of coffee sitting out on the counter for a few days.  It's sure to grow a spot of mold on top.  Since it can take up to two weeks to colonize a straw project, liquid coffee is too dangerous to use.<br />RR"}}
