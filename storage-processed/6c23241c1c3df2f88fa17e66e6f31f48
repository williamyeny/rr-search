Dont cover and dont let the vermiculite get wet or contaminated.</blockquote><br />As an added protection, the holes can be covered with medical micropore tape, which is breathable.&nbsp; You put the medical tape on before sterilization, and it keeps the top layer of verm sterile until you punch the needle through.&nbsp; Simply inject right through the micropore tape, and leave the hole open afterwards.<br />You probably already know this, but you must also remove the foil.&nbsp; Leaving the foil in place during colonization will lead to a higher rate of contamination, as well as stalling from lack of gas exchange.<br />RR"}}
