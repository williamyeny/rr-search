This ensures the urea and the especially toxic byproduct after bacteria get to it; ammonia, is evaporated off.&nbsp; Your entire concept is based on a false premise.<br />Further, chemical fertilizers are not made with urea. they're most often made using ammonium nitrate, something I doubt your bacteria would appreciate too much and mycelium isn't too appreciative of salts either.<br />I have not yet observed anything which can be added to mushroom substrates to make the fruits more potent. <br />RR","title":"Re: Hydroponic Nutrient Experiment Straw & LC"}}
