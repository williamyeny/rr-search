It comes on rolls 24\" and 36\" wide at any hardware or home megacenter.  Just ask for hardware cloth and they should point you right to it.<br />It's really rare for them to not fruit in that amount of time. You might try slicing a bite sized piece off of one of them to check for smell.  They should smell like fresh mushrooms.  If they smell sour, sweet, or like garbage, then that's what they are.  If they smell like fresh mushrooms, hopefully they'll fruit soon.  Just keep misting and fan once or twice a day.  The holes will help keep air moving between fannings.  After the roll, if you didn't mist heavily until the verm was nice and wet, do it now.  The verm on the cake serves as your 'casing layer'.<br />RR"}}
