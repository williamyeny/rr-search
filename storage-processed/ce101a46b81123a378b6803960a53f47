It's incorrect that you want to dilute the 3% any more. 3% is the strength to spray on Dactylium(cobweb) for example.<br />I disagree with lowering humidity.  Mushroom primordia form best in near 100% humidity with plenty of fresh air.  This means you want fresh air and moving air, coupled with high humidity.  If the casing layer is saturated, it means you've over misted, or possibly made it too wet to begin with, but high humidity will not get your casing layer wet, but rather will only slow down the evaporation of moisture from it.<br />Mutants such as you show in the first picture are genetic in nature and not caused by anything you did, or didn't do.  If you clone one of those fruits, your entire next project will look like that.  Personally, I think they're cool and have several isolated mutant strains that are fun to grow once in a while. Here's one of them below. Good luck to you.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/080503-46/77312-30367.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/080503-46/77312-thumb_30367.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Casing opinions?"}}
