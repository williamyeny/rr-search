As this happens, the pressure causes excess gas to leave the jars.&nbsp; When the jars are cooling,the volume per gas molecules ratio are much smaller than before from gas escaping from heat causing the pressure to pull inward on the glass.&nbsp; If you dont make the lids loose, the pressure causes the glass to crack.&nbsp; So like I said before, close them all the way and open a quarter turn to ensure that they are loose enough without falling off.</blockquote><br />This is bad advice.&nbsp; Tighten the lids all the way.&nbsp; Glass jars are designed to hold a vacuum without breaking as this is how they preserve canned food. However, since you have holes in the lids for inoculation/gas exchange, there won't be any vacuum pulled.<br />Remember, we're not filling the jar up with liquid the way it's done when canning peaches.&nbsp; We're using a moist but not wet substrate and there's nothing to boil over, so to maintain sterility we tighten the lids until snug.<br />RR"}}
