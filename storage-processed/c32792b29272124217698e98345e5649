My guess is going to be the medium speed.  When you're testing the unit, hold a cig lighter six inches from the filter.  The flame should  bend all the way over, but not blow out.  Adjust the fan speed up or down to get that amount of flow.  The resistance of the filter will create static pressure in the box behind the filter, and this will provide even flow."}}
