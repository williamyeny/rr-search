Mushroom mycelium is rather slow growing.  I'd try to rub as much as you can off.  Most molds are harmless, but I sure can't recommend eating them, without a positive ID.   Always fan dry for several days until they're nearly cracker dry, and then use desiccant for that last little bit.  You want to get them match stick brittle before packaging.<br />RR"}}
