Leave it at 12/12, or simply put your fruiting chamber near a bright window.  Many years of successful growing has taught us that 12/12 is the best sequence.  Mushrooms will not fruit well from a minute of light per day, nor will they fruit well from a few hours.  They do best when exposed to a normal day/night routine based on the 24 hour day.<br />RR"}}
