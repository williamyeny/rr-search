I am not just sitting here waiting for everyone to answer my questions for me. I am on the phone, reading books, going to my bank, going to the local investment firm, going to the library, etc. - doing all the footwork while waiting for any information others may post. This is a very important practice called, \"leveraging your time.\"<br />I hope I have sufficiently explained myself...<br />- Deathbliss</blockquote><br />That's all good, but I answered your question above.&nbsp; I have a commercial mushroom farm in Washington State, and I sell to grocery stores and at farmers markets.&nbsp; I really don't know what more to add.&nbsp; When you have a business in the state, you need a UBI and that's that, because you have to report and pay taxes on income.&nbsp; I don't have the million dollar liability policy, and any stores that demand it don't get my mushrooms.&nbsp; I'm nearly always sold out, so my advice is to hell with paying profit to an insurance company.&nbsp; Don't sell rotten product and it won't be an issue.&nbsp; People don't get e coli from mushrooms grown on sterilized sawdust.<br />The most important thing is to learn to grow mushrooms.&nbsp; Getting from starting point to where you have a facility with enough production to handle commercial sales is going to take a couple of years at least, which gives plenty of time to learn the paperwork involved.<br />RR"}}
