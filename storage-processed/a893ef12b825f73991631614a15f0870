My condo is full of the stuff, and I've been growing here successfully for years.  Run a heater and fan on it to dry the stuff out.  Once the wall is dry, the mold will die.  Bleach won't kill molds.  Look at your local home megacenter for a mold killing spray in the paint department.  Another alternative is to make a paste with water and hydrated lime, and apply that over the mold.<br />RR"}}
