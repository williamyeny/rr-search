Horse manure substrates do well in the two to four inch range.  Straw does well up to ten or twelve inches.  The key is that air/gasses have to be able to exchange, or the core of the substrate becomes anaerobic and the mycelium dies.  No casing layer on the bottom.  Casing layers go on top.  With dunking/soaking teks, there is really no need for a thicker casing layer than .5 inch.<br />RR"}}
