Most types of lime work great on your lawn where they have all season to break down, but the average life of a casing layer is two months or less, so granulated lime doesn't have time to be of much use.<br />My formula that has always worked fine is to use hydrated lime at 5% by volume of the peat moss used.  In other words, for ten cups of peat, use 1/2 cup of lime.  Don't count the vermiculite when making the calculation, only the peat.  This will give a starting ph in the area of 8 to 8 1/2.<br />RR","title":"Re: Peat Moss and Hydrated Lime...Casing questions."}}
