Rice, grains or even manure under water at room temp will grow bacteria in a matter of hours.<br />CO2 is vastly overrated.  We fan to provide fresh air for the mycelium, and to get rid of stale air which favors molds.  By the time the mycelium gets to the fruiting stage, CO2 output is very low.  There is also heat generated by the substrate which creates air currents that swirl the CO2/air around in the box.  It won't be all CO2 on the bottom.  <br />If you have enough perlite for humidity, you can leave the lid cracked a bit all the time for continuous air exchange during fruiting and forget all about fanning, or at least cut back to once per day.<br />RR","title":"Re: Air exchange question"}}
