Green molds are not toxic to human digestive systems, and besides, the mold isn't conducted into the fruits anyway. <br />Healthy mushrooms are fine, whether or not the substrate has mold on it.&nbsp; However, if it's your first time growing, you better make sure that's the species you were growing and not a contaminant species of mushroom.<br />Always toss out contaminated substrates as soon as they're discovered.&nbsp; You can bury them outdoors and they might fruit, but you always want to get them out of your growing area.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />slightly contaminated cake</blockquote><br />That's like being slightly pregnant.<br />RR","title":"Re: slightly contaminated cake"}}
