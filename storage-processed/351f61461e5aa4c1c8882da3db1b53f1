They're free that way because they need a place to dump them.  You really need to find a sawmill to get the sawdust though.  You don't want what you'd get from a woodworker or furinture shop because it's too fine.  You want course sawdust.  Sometimes, the pellet fuel you get for stoves is made from hardwood sawdust, and if so it works great.  Most of what I've seen lately is pine, and not usable.<br />If I could find a decent shipping method, I can get 40 LB bags of Alder sawdust for $12.<br />RR"}}
