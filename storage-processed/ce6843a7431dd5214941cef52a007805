It's important to have a high CO2 level during colonization.  If you have too much fresh air, the substrate will pin.  In addition, if the substrate is drying out, that is another pinning trigger.  Mycelium normally will only form primordia when it has captured the available substrate.  Something is telling the mycelium that there is no more food to colonize.  Otherwise, it wouldn't pin-light or no light.<br />RR"}}
