I've cloned tissue from fruits before and observed multiple sectors branch out.  I don't mean different mycelium types, but actual sectors of non-compatible strains.  It's fairly rare because most strains combine via anastomosis prior to flushing, but it does happen sometimes, and it's much more common when cloning wild fruits.  <br />RR","title":"Re: question about cloning"}}
