If you don't like it, fill out a support ticket and let the administrators handle it.<br />Fusarium is a contaminant of grains, plants and soil.  The only way it would ever contaminate a mushroom crop is if someone failed to sterilze their grains first.  Under normal conditions of growth, fusarium will not be seen in mushroom cultivation.  I closed the first thread to stop discussion of weapons on a mushroom website.  That isn't our purpose.  <br />I shouldn't be expected to write a book on the specific fungi you posted that the Russians weaponized.  In 35 years of mushroom cultivation, I've never seen it.  If you restart this thread, I'll issue a ban.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fusarium mycotoxin is a chemical weapon and is a contaminant of mushroom culture"}}
