Stems are very hollow and when I dehydrate they shrink pretty good. To me 20 grams dry doesn't seem to match up to a lot of peoples grows especially from 10 cakes. I do have a 2nd flush starting maybe my luck will change.</blockquote><br />Hollow stems can be caused by genetics, but the most common cause is excessive temperature.&nbsp; Keep your fruiting temps to 25C or below.&nbsp; The next biggest factor is lighting, assuming your substrate moisture level is correct.&nbsp; Give 12 hours of bright light in the 6500K color temperature spectrum, or bright light from a window with good sun exposure.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sorta Newbie Looking for advice please read"}}
