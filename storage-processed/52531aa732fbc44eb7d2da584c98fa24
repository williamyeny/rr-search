Anyone know if direct and constant exposure to lights from the aforementioned spectrum and wattage can damage your mushrooms?</blockquote><br />I have to say, in the decades I've been growing mushrooms, that's the first time I've ever heard that nonsense.&nbsp; It's just not true.&nbsp; We are constantly exposed to bad info such as 'colonize in darkness' and the equally incorrect 'if you can see them, there's enough light' but never that excess light exposure is bad.&nbsp; <br />Mushrooms derive energy from light, using it in ways not fully understood to convert sugars in the substrate into ATP in the cells, but not by the same mechanism plants do.&nbsp; Bright light is better than dim light, and light in the 6500 Kelvin color temperature spectrum is best of all.<br />Hang a fluorescent 'natural daylight' lamp within a few inches of your fruiting chamber and you'll do well.&nbsp; More wattage is better than less, provided you don't cause excess heat which will dry out your substrates.&nbsp; Even direct outdoor sunlight for a few minutes per day is great and will often coax a stubborn substrate to begin fruiting.&nbsp; Use a 12/12 day-night schedule.<br />RR","title":"Re: Creating a Shotgun Terrarium"}}
