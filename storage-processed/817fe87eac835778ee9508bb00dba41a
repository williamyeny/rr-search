The mycelium produces a bit of heat as it grows, and this temperature differential causes condensation on the warm side.  Since it's warmer in the jar than outside, the condensation forms inside the jar.<br />You can see this phenomena in reverse when you take a beer out of the refrigerator.  The temperature differential causes condensation to form on the outside of the beer can, glass of ice tea, etc.<br />RR"}}
