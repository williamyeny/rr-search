To spawn to bulk, you want fresh, rapidly expanding mycelium.<br />I always add coffee to the soak water for grains.<br />You don't need to remove a bulk substrate from the tub to soak.  You can dunk(soak is a much more accurate term) right in the tub by running the faucet gently into the tub and letting it overflow and run down the drain for a few hours.  Soak water need not be distilled or sterile.  I've never used anything but tap water.<br />Never inject anything but water into a substrate.  Mushroom mycelium 'eats' the substrate, rather than drinking up the 'nutes'.  That's why a bulk substrate shrinks over time.  It's not just the loss of moisture.  If you tried to inject something like coffee, you'll end up with molds.  You also don't want to soak the substrate in anything but plain water.<br />RR"}}
