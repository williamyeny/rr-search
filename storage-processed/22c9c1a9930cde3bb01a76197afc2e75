The jar on the left is pan cyan and on the right is cubensis.  The picture on the right is a petri dish with three growths of mold.  You can see the difference in both texture and color.  I can't tell from your pictures so let them grow and see what happens. Perhaps you can tell from these pictures is yours is the right thing or not.  They're not hurting anything as long as they stay in the jars even if they are contaminated.<br />To take good jar pictures you need a light shining from a 45 degree angle as you can see from the shadows below.  The flash makes a glare because it bounces off the glass right back at the lense.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-17/627178716-Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-17/627178716-thumb_Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/577079997-Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-16/577079997-thumb_Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg\"></a>"}}
