This will help prevent direct transmission of contaminants on the cap to your print.  Let it print for a couple of hours, then print onto something else.  Use the several prints you make separately. Make the prints inside a glovebox.  Hopefully, one of them will be contaminant free.<br />Of course, swiping the spores on agar and isolating away from contaminants is still the preferred method.<br />RR","title":"Re: Prints from outdoor shrooms"}}
