You have to have a sterile environment when putting a cake into a chamber....Especially when its colonizing.

What would you suggest?</blockquote><br />I've read that too, and every time it makes me want to shoot whomever wrote it, since it's blatantly false, but disinformation keeps getting repeated here and it fucks up people's grows.&nbsp; Find a very&nbsp; bright window, or look for a fluorescent fixture with tubes in the 6,500 Kelvin range.&nbsp; That's the color that has shown to produce the best pinsets.<br />I'd get rid of the ultrasonic too.&nbsp; You want your substrate to begin to dry out slightly, and then moistureize it via misting.&nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&nbsp; Substrates that are waterlogged or have a steady-state moisture level perform poorly.<br />RR"}}
