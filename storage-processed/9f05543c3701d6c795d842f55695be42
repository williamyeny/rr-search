If you're using ground limestone, you'll probably want a bit more than that.  If you use hydrated lime, a bit less.  With hydrated lime, I figure one teaspoon per cup of dry peat, and that gets it really close.  It's hard to measure PH as you go because it needs a couple of hours to settle down to get a good reading, and you really need to mix the lime with the dry peat to get it mixed in well.<br />Mix the dry ingredients except the verm together before wetting.  Moisten the peat/lime/oyster shells/gypsum in one bowl and the verm in another, then mix together.  Adjust to field capacity and pasteurize.<br />RR"}}
