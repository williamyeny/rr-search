There is a break-in period with the metal to metal seal where it will leak a bit the first five or six times you use it.  After that, it seals up perfectly.  Do as hyphae said to get the lid even, then barely snug the wing nuts.  Once the lid is even and the nuts are just barely against the lid, give each one no more than 1/4 turn, tightening the two opposite nuts simultaneously.  <br />RR"}}
