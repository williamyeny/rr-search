It's extremely important that cakes and other substrates have a chance to dry out slightly between mistings/waterings, and the judgement call of when to mist needs to be made with your eyeballs, not a timer, and the misting needs to be done by hand. Don't fix what isn't broken. A good use for that coolmist is to shitcan the hoses, etc., and run it in your room 24/7 to raise ambient humidity.<br />RR"}}
