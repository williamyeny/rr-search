Your trays will deliver more than enough humidity just by themselves when fruiting time comes.  While the casing layer is colonizing you must have gas exchange.  Don't confuse gas exchange with fresh air exchange(fae) which is one of the pinning triggers.<br />Just wrap the top of the tray with aluminum foil, then poke one or two nail sized holes in the foil for gas exchange.  Unless your temps are below 75F, you don't need or want to add heat.  I colonize on an open shelf, not in a container.<br />RR","title":"Re: fruiting question"}}
