Light or no light is irrelevant before then. They won't usually pin before then anyway, so this prevents losing your moisture during this time period.   The substrate itself should provide the humidity in a tub.  You want to mist any substrate or casing layer that appears to be drying out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pic off pins or not pic off pins that is the question"}}
