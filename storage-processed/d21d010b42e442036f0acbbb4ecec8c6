Trich mycelium is more 'spotty' then cubensis, and NEVER rhizomorphic OR cottony.  It is however, white.<br />Air exchange and a cycling humidity will help to control trichoderma but nothing will eliminate it.  I've been doing this for a long time and throw out projects every week, but bear in mind, I'm using wood based substrates these days almost exclusively.<br />When you see green on a bulk substrate or casing layer, mist it lightly to hold the spores in place, then gently slip the tray into a platic trash bag.  Seal immediately and discard.  There are methods to save a wood or sawdust based substrate from trich if you catch it fast enough, but cased substrates should get tossed.<br />RR","title":"Re: Ultrasonic or Cool Mist?"}}
