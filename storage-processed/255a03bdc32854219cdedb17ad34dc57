The idea with pasteurization is for the bacteria to survive, while killing the mold spores which die at a much lower temperature.  <br />Remember, bacteria is only a problem with your spawn, be it brf, rye, wbs, whatever.  Once your spawn is fully colonized and placed into a bulk substrate, bacteria is your <i>friend</i> as it helps to keep the substrate alive, therefore resisting molds such as trichoderma.<br />RR"}}
