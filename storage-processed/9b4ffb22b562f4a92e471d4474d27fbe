The yellow liquid looks like metabolites, but I'm not so sure that what you have growing is mushrooom mycelium.<br />There's a lot of condensation inside the jar too, so it looks like you might be colonizing at too high a temperature.  Any temperature over 80F is going to encourage molds and metabolite discharges.  <br />When was that jar inoculated and what are the conditions of temperature?  Also, did you provide for gas exchange through holes in the lid?<br />RR"}}
