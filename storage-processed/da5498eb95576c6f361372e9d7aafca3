Then I started these logs, and the first log delivered more than all four baskets combined.  If you scroll up and look at the pic of the log in this thread, I doubt you will see a flush that thick on the top of a casing.  I know I haven't.   That is a 48\" log, 8\" diameter, that produced 17 LBS wet, and the whole thing was finished and out of the grow room in 3 weeks from date of spawning.  That size log uses roughly the same amount of straw used in a laundry basket, but at least 3 times the yeild, and in half the time. Didn't mist once from start to finish.  I'm not trying to convince anyone....I just happened to see the thread and put my 2 cents worth in.  Happy shrooming all. ","title":"Re: Everbody head on over to mycotopia"}}
