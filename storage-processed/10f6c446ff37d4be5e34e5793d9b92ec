Rinse under the faucet both before and after the dunk.  Wait one week after full colonization, then do a dunk and roll.  Room temp works fine, but I'd suggest taking them out at 12 hours and rinsing again, and changing the dunk water for fresh.  I dunk in a large kettle, with a heavy glass dinner plate to hold the cakes under water.<br />RR"}}
