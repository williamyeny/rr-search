There is no requirement from the FDA to get rid of them, or even a suggestion to. Green molds are not toxic to healthy humans, period.  Don't breathe the spores, but mushrooms harvested from a cake with a spot of trichoderma or penicillium on the opposite side will not hurt you in any way.  <br />Putting the cake outside in a manure bed is the best answer, providing it's warm enough in your area.  You don't want those spores floating around your grow room, contaminating future grows.<br />RR"}}
