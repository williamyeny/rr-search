In addition, you don't need to filter the air for a fruiting chamber.  I'd suggest dumping the aquarium pump and just drilling holes and/or leaving the lid crooked.  CO2 is only slightly heavier than normal air, and won't drain like water, even with holes at the bottom, which you should also have.  I have LOTS of holes in my terrariums, including on the floor.  I drill at least a dozen or more on all six sides.  My larger terrariums have several hundred holes drilled into them.<br />RR"}}
