A knife will destroy the spores by cutting them.  Use an inoculating loop and after flame sterilizing, dip it into the agar to cool.  Then gently touch it to the print, and then swipe the spores that stick to the loop on your agar.<br />You can drop a wedge of agar into a grain jar, but not a pf jar because the dry verm would block the path.  You'll ideally want a laminar flow hood, but a glovebox will do if you're fast and careful.<br />RR","title":"Re: Inoculation without syringe"}}
