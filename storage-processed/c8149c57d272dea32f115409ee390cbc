My reasoning is to keep the CO2 levels high during colonization.  If you have holes in the bottom, you lose that.  Additionally, the air exchange on the bottom will lead to pinning down there, especially if light also can get in.  The answer is to maintain proper moisture content.  If your substrate is at the proper level, and you don't over water, there is no need for holes.<br />RR"}}
