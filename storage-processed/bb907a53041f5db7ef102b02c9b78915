It's not a contamination and it's not hyphal knots.  They're pins that are seriously mutated.  Most likely they'll finish aborting.   It's probably just a bad strain, but in the future, don't dunk in anything but plain water.  Your mycelium wants to stop feeding and growing at pinning, so when you dunk in a nutrient solution, you screw up nature's timing.<br />RR"}}
