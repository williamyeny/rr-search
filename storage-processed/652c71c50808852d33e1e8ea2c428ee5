People have a right to get paid for the work they do, period.&nbsp; Those of you with jobs expect a paycheck on Friday.&nbsp; If someone hacked into your bank and stole your money, you'd expect the 'government' to get it back for you and arrest the thieves.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />i undrstand totally, but i bought your dvd. i had previosly downloaded them for free off of your website. if it wasn't for the free downloads, i might never have bought it.</blockquote><br />Those are sample clips.&nbsp; I put them there and everyone is welcome to download them.&nbsp; That's why they're there.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />And if it does pass sites like this will be gone.</blockquote><br />Nonsense.&nbsp; If a site like this gets notice there's copyrighted material posted, they have ample time to take it down.&nbsp; If they refuse, THEN they get taken to court where they still have an opportunity to tell their side.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />RR uses AOL dial-up internet compact discs to connect to the interwebs. Of course he's not going to mind if these bills pass. It's not like it will effect him negatively.</blockquote><br />Gosh, now you're just making shit up.&nbsp; I get internet via satellite dish because of my remote location.&nbsp; Dial up is not even available here because it's 45 miles to the nearest hardwire phone switch.&nbsp; Satellite is not a whole lot faster than dialup in speed, but I'd cut off my nuts before sending money to AOL.&nbsp; If you think the only reason I don't pirate other people's work is because I have slow internet, you seriously misjudge my moral character.<br />RR","title":"Re: What gives?"}}
