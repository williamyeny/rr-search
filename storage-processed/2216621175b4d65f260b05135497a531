It's the filter and is exposed to contaminants entering the holes in the jar during colonization.  Wash the verm filter off and replace it by dunking and rolling.<br />Place the cakes in the terrarium so that what was the top of the jar is now the bottom.   The reason is the bottom of the jar is concave, thus it leaves an indentation on the bottom of the cake.  This makes a nice 'bowl' to hold moisture later when it becomes the top and is filled with vermiculite.  You can actually pour water directly on top of the cake, saturating the verm in this 'bowl' and it will slowly hydrate the cake, supplying moisture for the flush.  It's OK if mushrooms grow from the bottom of the cake.  Just let them grow.  They pick their own favorite place to pin, so don't mess with them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pinning at the bottom"}}
