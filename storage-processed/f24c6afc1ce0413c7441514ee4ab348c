When they get so rusty I'm afraid they won't seal, I discard and replace.  By seal, I mean I use metal side down, so the metal/glass interface is the seal.  If you use rubberside down, they can be a real pain to open because they stick.  <br />You might want to put a second filter in each lid.  I'm not sure one will be enough.<br />RR"}}
