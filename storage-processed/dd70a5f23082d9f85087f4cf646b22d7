If you heat beyond 170f, you're partially sterilizing and you'll have the same problems PC'ing will cause.  A few minutes in the microwave will easily exceed that temperature, killing off beneficial bacteria that will help your substrate resist attack by harmful thermophilic bacteria and molds.  I pasteurize in quart jars after first mixing the ingredients and bringing to field moisture capacity.  I posted my procedure for it somewhere in this forum previously.<br />Coir is relatively low in calcium, so it can really benefit from the addition of gypsum at the rate of up to 5% to 10% by volume the amount of dry coir.<br />RR"}}
