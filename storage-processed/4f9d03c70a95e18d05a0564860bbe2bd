Do another row at the top.  You don't need polyfill to stop contaminants in a fruiting chamber.  I have several 4\" holes cut into my mini greenhouse, including a 4\" dryer hose connecting it to the outside air.  Remember, you want circulation and turbulence in a fruiting chamber.  Don't worry about contaminant spores getting on your project.  Just make the environment inhospitable to them and you'll be fine."}}
