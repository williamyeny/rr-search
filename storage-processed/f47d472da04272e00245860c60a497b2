Lighting is extremely important, and it's important to provide it at the right light temperature and intensity.  Look for tubes with a light temperature above 5,000K.<br />The reason intensity is important is because the light needs to penetrate the casing layer to the substrate below.  Frequency is also important with light at the higher end of the spectrum, such as natural daylight fluorescent with a light temperature between 6,000K and 7,500K providing the best results.  Cool white fluorescent tubes are generally in the 5,000 Kelvin range, and regular incandescent bulbs run about 3,000K, which is the worst possible choice.<br />RR","title":"Re: Are these fluorescent tubes any good for mushies?"}}
