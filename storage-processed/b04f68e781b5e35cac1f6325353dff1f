If not, flaming inside the glovebox will still fog up the inside, making it hard to see.<br />Somebody please explain to me how alcohol wiping cleans the <i>inside</i> of the needle where the inoculant is in direct contact as it passes.&nbsp; Flaming the needle until red hot ensures the inoculant has a clean path into your jar.<br />RR","title":"Re: Needle Flaming Between Jars (PF Tek)"}}
