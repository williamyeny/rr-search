Remember, they're leached and pasteurized as the coffee brews.<br />I'll take a wild stab and say it would probably work if you picked it small enough.  We don't have bamboo in my climate so I've never tried it.  It seems like when it's large, it gets woody which would not be good. Dry small shoots in the sun and shred them well.  Pasteurize and inoculate with brand new, not spent cakes.  Let us know how it goes.<br />RR"}}
