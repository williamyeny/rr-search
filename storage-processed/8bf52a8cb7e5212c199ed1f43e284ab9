Equate 'strains' with 'races'.   A human from Europe will have no trouble breeding with a human from South America, and the resulting child will NOT be a hybrid but a 'cross', since both parents come from the same species.  The more dominant human genes do not 'take over', nor do they fight it out.  They mix.  Ditto with two strains of the same species of fungi.   The Redboy is not a hybrid, but simply a cross.<br />A true hybrid would be if one could cross a cube with an azurescens or pan cyan, or an oyster with a shiitake.  Work is also underway in that area, and some promising developments are unfolding.  Expect more in the coming months.<br />RR","title":"Re: What happens when you mix spores? Oops"}}
