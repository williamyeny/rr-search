It's fine to clean out a glovebox or table if you mix it at ten percent, or also mixed at ten percent it can be used to disinfect a mini-greenhouse to kill flies and fly larvae between crop cycles.  30% bleach is too strong though.  Don't go over ten percent or it isn't as effective.<br />In addition, any perlite that is under water is useless and may as well not be there.  Remember, perlite works by evaporating moisture from its surface.  If that surface is under water, nothing is going to evaporate off from it.  You should wet your perlite under the faucet with running water, then drain well in a collander and toss into the FC two to three inches deep.  This will provide the maximum possible humidity for three to six weeks at which time you can repeat the process.<br />RR","title":"Re: cake vs. bleach"}}
