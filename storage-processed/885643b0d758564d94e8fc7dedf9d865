Set it near them and they'll start drinking.  The ants will eat up the borax/karo, then take it back to the nest to feed the entire colony including the queens.  It takes about a week, and the whole colony is wiped out.  This works for those black wood ants that eat holes in your house too.<br />RR"}}
