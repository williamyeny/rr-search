The reason I changed it to a teaspoon was some growers aren't capable of calculating 5%, and they think a teaspoon means to take one of the 'small spoons' in their silverware set and fill it so it's heaping full, which is actually closer to a tablespoon, which is around the original 5%.<br />Of course, the best thing is to get some pH strips and set your casing mix so it's in the 7.5 to 8.5 range at makeup, and it will be fine.  Also note when using hydrated lime, if you measure right after you mix it up, the pH will be as high as 9, but will drop over an hour or two into the 7.5 to 8 range.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question for RR about lime in casing mix..."}}
