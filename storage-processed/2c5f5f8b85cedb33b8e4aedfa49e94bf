I've read teks (no links) that people spoke of using alc soaked sponges or pads to knock up jars without any flame sterilization involved. Actually most of the knocking up I've been reading about in GBs have been done solely with alcohol wiping with the worry of \"blowing up\" your GB. <br />It seems everyone in this thread says the exact opposite?</blockquote><br />Every time I see someone talk of wiping a flame sterilized needle with an alcohol soaked rag or sponge, I tell them just how dumb that is.&nbsp; I can't catch it every time though, there's just too many 'tards.<br />If you don't have a glovebox for some reason, use a clear plastic bag big enough to stick your hands in to work.<br />RR"}}
