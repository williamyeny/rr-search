This is an ongoing discussion that's been repeated for many years.  Everybody I know from several years ago that pushed the very dark syringes, now uses very light ones, so that says something.  Personally, I haven't injected a jar with a spore syringe in many years.  In fact, the last time I did was with one of pf's first ones he shipped out in the mid 90's.  I always isolate on agar, then make master slants with the best performers, and those last a lifetime.<br />RR"}}
