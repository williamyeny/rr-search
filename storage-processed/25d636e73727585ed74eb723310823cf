Rough percentages I just use my eye.<br />But I have meant to ask about layering, is there a knack to it? I basically just keep them all very thin, first substrate then spawn, just enough spawn to cover the previous sub layer, until I reach the top. Last layer a bit thicker substrate.</blockquote><br />That's the way to do it.&nbsp; Disregard anyone who says layering is outdated.&nbsp; The mycelium in the grain layer re-knits together first and then takes off into the substrate with a vengeance. For this reason, it's better to have fewer, but thicker grain layers.<br />I've done mixing and layering thousands of times each.&nbsp; With spawn bags, one must shake, so by nature it's well mixed.&nbsp; With trays of manure or other bulk substrates we have the luxury of layering.&nbsp; Be sure to always cover with a layer of substrate on top so there are no exposed grains, as you did.<br />To the rest of you, please quit 'jacking the thread.<br />RR","title":"Re: Layering technique"}}
