In my opinion, the costs of failure even if only 10% of the time, are far more than the care required for repeated success.<br />As for the no-soak, no-rinse grain prep method, that's what was described in Stamets' The Mushroom Cultivator published in the 80s.&nbsp; Since that time, we've developed better ways of doing grains that result in less sticking and clumping together, but that doesn't mean the old methods don't still work.&nbsp; I wish the best of luck to all, regardless of the methods you use.&nbsp; It's all good.<br />RR"}}
