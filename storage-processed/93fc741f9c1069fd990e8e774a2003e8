Almost a set it and forget it thing.  By the way, what you see on that shelf is 100% edibles.  I'm experimenting with pf cakes both with brf/verm and brf/sawdust with most of the edible species I have, to see what it works and doesn't work with.   I think pf cakes are an excellent way to bring straight edible growers into the hobby.   Think about it.  The more mainstream mushroom growing becomes, the easier it will be to get the materials we need.  I'd like to see it as common as gardening, with grandmas cooking up pf jars to grow oysters on.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/139225730-pf_oysters_011a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/139225730-thumb_pf_oysters_011a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: I need help with an incubator ASAP, please."}}
