Just leave it under the gently running kitchen faucet for a few hours.  Let the water overflow the tray and run down the drain.  The running water will prevent bacteria buildup during the dunk and might even wash a few contaminant spores off in the process.  Put a couple of rocks or whatever you have on top of the substrate to hold it submerged.<br />RR"}}
