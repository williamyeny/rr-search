The analogy with cow pies is not accurate.  The cow patty actually <u>shades</u> the mycelium which is growing in the composted grasses below the cow pie.  Cow patties serve a function more as a casing layer than as the substrate in cow pastures.  Mycelium in a jar will cook at those temperatures.  <br />This is just one of many experiences with incubators that makes me constantly preach using room temperature for incubation.  I haven't used an incubator in many years.<br />RR"}}
