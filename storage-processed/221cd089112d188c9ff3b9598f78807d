You can also see the 'steel wool' look of cobweb in babo's picture.  Mushroom mycelium doesn't look like that.  <br />You need to spray the entire surface of a casing layer with peroxide to get rid of the cobweb.  If you don't do that, it will come right back.  The peroxide also is harmful but not fatal to mushroom mycelium, so any pins you hit with the spray are likely to abort, but that's the procedure.<br />Use 3% peroxide.  It's available over the counter in grocery and drug stores all over the US.  If you get a higher percentage of HOO2, do the math and dilute to 3% with distilled water.<br />RR"}}
