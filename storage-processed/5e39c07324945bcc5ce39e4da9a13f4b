It will take several mistings an hour apart over a day or two to get your moisture back.  I'd also pour, <i>yes pour</i> water around the edges.  Wait two hours, then pour any excess back out.<br />Once pins are the size of yours they won't abort from misting as long as you up the FAE to let them dry off.  Misting, then closing a container up tight will cause them to abort.  Don't allow them to sit wet is the idea.<br />RR","title":"Re: Case shrinking - Lack of water?"}}
