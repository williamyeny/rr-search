Try turning the flash off.  It reflects off the glass and makes the image hard to see.  If you have a couple of desk lamps, put them on the jars at angles so the glare is reflected away from the camera.  Also, put the jar down to take the picture.  One hand wiggles a bit with the camera and makes the picture blurry.  The other hand wiggles a bit with the jar and makes it twice as bad.   Best is to have the jar on a table and the camera on a tripod.  That will put the pic in best focus.<br />RR"}}
