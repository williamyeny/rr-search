That ain't going to fly.  Don't do it again.  One doesn't have to bash another tek to prove a point.  I won't allow disinformation to be propagated in the cultivation forums.  These forums are open to everyone to learn ALL teks, not just the one you think is best.  If you want to hash out the pf tek vs. bulk substrates, simply do a few searches and you'll see this very thing has been hashed out dozens of times.  There's no reason to do it again.<br />RR","title":"Re: PF-Tek?"}}
