The white, milky slime you see is bacteria. <br />I don't consider glass petri dishes useful for mycology at all.  The plastic dishes come 20 to a sleeve and presterilized.  You open the sleeve immediately before pouring the dishes.  As soon as they solidify, wrap with parafilm, not plastic wrap.<br />You'll have far less problems with bacteria if you'll let the agar cool almost to room temperature before pouring.  Remember, as the agar cools, it shrinks which draws in air/contaminants to the petri dish.  Allow the filtered bottle of agar to cool until no heat protection is required for your hands.  This will cut down on condensation as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: AGAR - are these bacteria or what? help (w/ pix) none of them have been inoculated yet"}}
