NEVER try to cut mold out.  It only spreads the spores around your house and all over you and your clothes, contaminating everything.<br />Bleach doesn't kill mold. You can dip trichoderma in ten percent bleach and it won't kill it. For that matter, you can dip trichoderma in pure bleach and it won't kill it.    Bleach kills bacteria and mold spores, but not live mycelium.<br />Sterilizing a fruiting chamber is not necessary.  I don't even use soap anymore.  I just rinse out with water and put back to use.  You prevent molds by having proper FAE, which you won't get with an aquarium pump.  You need to drill holes all over your fc and also fan a few times daily.  The more air you give, the less chance of contamination.<br />3% peroxide will kill cobweb mold on contact.  However, with trich growing which you can't kill, you need to get that FC cleaned out asap.  Toss the contents or put them outside if it's warm enough.  They will usually recover and fruit outdoors.<br />RR"}}
