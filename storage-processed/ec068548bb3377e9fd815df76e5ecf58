A week is better.  It's very rare for mycleium to fruit in less than a week from full colonization.  If you birth at full colonization, your cake sits there drying out for that week until it's ready to fruit.  If you let it sit in the jar and consolidate the substrate, it's ready to fruit right after you dunk and roll.   Your results will be better if you wait longer.<br />RR","title":"Re: A few questions about a first grow."}}
