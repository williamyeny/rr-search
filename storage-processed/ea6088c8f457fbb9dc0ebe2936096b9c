I use and reuse mine hundreds of times.   Simply fill the syringe with water and place in a large kettle of cold water.  Turn on the stove and bring the water to a boil.  Allow to boil for at least twenty minutes.  In your clean room, remove the syringe from the hot water and squirt out the water that is inside.  It is now ready to reuse.  If you get contaminants, they came from some other source.<br />RR","title":"Re: Re-using Syringes"}}
