I thought the purpose of using perlite was so the humidity in the terrarium was maintained, so that you DON'T have to mist. I thought the only reason for having a shotgun terrarium was to avoid CO2 build up. So now I have to use perlite with water AND mist? <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/confused.gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\":confused:\"/></blockquote><br />Of course you have to mist.&nbsp; If the substrate is getting the proper amount of fresh air exchange, it will dry out, even at 99% humidity.&nbsp; That's why you mist.&nbsp; Misting is a major pinning trigger, because the substrate loses moisture to evaporation, and then you mist to replace it.&nbsp; This change in moisture content helps to initiates fruiting.&nbsp; A substrate that maintains a steady state-moisture content doesn't perform as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: Maintaining Humidity?"}}
