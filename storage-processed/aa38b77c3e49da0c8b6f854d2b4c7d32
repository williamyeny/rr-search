After cutting the openings, you can boil the phonebook in water for a few minutes to sterilize/hydrate it, and then when it cools, simply open it up with clean hands and put your spawn into the places you've previously cut out.<br />Did you see my phone book thread in the <i>gourmet and medicinal mushroom forum?</i>  If not, take a look.  Below are Hericium(Lion's Mane) but oysters grow from the same substrates.  I'll have some oyster pictures on phonebooks soon.  They're pinning now along with the Shiitake.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-34/787406675-phonebook_hericium_027a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-34/787406675-thumb_phonebook_hericium_027a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-34/787406648-phonebook_hericium_029a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-34/787406648-thumb_phonebook_hericium_029a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: How do i use a phonebook as substrate?"}}
