They won't pin for that week anyway, so allow them to stay in the jars and conserve mosture during that week after full colonization while the mycelium is consolidating its hold on the substrate.  That will make the difference between one or two fruits and a whole bundle.  Most people who get shitty pinsets with pf cakes birth the first day they see the jar all white, which is a huge mistake.<br />RR"}}
