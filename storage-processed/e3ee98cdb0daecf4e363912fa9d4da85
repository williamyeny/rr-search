Nobody has grown mushrooms by hydroponics.  Deep_traveler had an overcolonized LC made from rye berries and water that sprouted a small mushroom on the mycelium that colonized the surface.  That isn't hydroponics.<br />Those who think mushrooms can grow by hydroponics are stuck in the mindset that the mushroom is a plant and the mycelium is the roots.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />This thread gets repeated about once a month.  Several years ago I offered a microscope to anybody who could produce a ten gram or larger mushroom by hydroponics and there has been no takers.  Mushrooms are NOT plants and don't 'uptake' nutrients.  The mycelium is the organism itself and it consumes the food.  The mushroom is the sexual organ of the mycelium.<br />I've grown mushrooms on dozens of unusual substrates as a stroll through my gallery will show.  However, they were all done by providing the mycelium with a solid substrate that it could digest, not chemically treated water.<br />RR","title":"Re: On \"hyrdoponic mushrooms.\""}}
