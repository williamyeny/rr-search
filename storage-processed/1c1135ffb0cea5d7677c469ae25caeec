I recommend rye berries due to superior performance and uniform kernel size.  However, even with WBS, if you'll shake the collander as shown in the DVD while hot, it will steam off the excess moisture.  Make sure the WBS is dry on the surface when you load the jars, since that is the key.<br />All cubes and oyster strains do great on straw logs and laundry baskets as shown in the video(with oysters of course) but copelandia seems to do much better on manure substrates, and thin ones at that.  If you're growing pan cyans(copes), I'd suggest either cow or horse manure, and make the substrate no thicker than 1 1/2\".  For some reason, copes don't appreciate a thick substrate the way other species do.  Use a peat/verm casing layer no thicker than 1/4\", and be sure to buffer it with lime.  Add gypsum at ten percent of the amount of peat.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
