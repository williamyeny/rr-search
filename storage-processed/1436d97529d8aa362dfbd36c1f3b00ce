A mini greenhouse should have plenty of free air exchange to handle both at once.  I do it all the time.  I have had five or six different species growing at the same time for years now, including oysters.  A mini greenhouse is not a terrarium that stays closed up.  Leave the door cracked open a bit if you need for air exchange.  My mini-greenhouse has a 4\" clothes dryer hose running  through the wall to the outside for fresh air intake.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cubes & Oysters at the same time"}}
