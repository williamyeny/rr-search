I use the lids upside down, so the metal is against the glass, but that is just to make them easier to get off later.  The rubber tends to stick, making it a chore to lift the lid when you need to open the jar.  The jar will always be at the same pressure as the rest of the PC, so there is no problem there.  When I sterilize water or test tube slants, I screw the lid down tight with no filter or vent holes.  It's not a problem, provided you don't ever pop the weight off the PC at the end of the cycle before pressure has returned slowly to zero on its own.<br />RR","title":"Re: WBS Qs"}}
