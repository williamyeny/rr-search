One is less moisture.&nbsp; The mycelium works harder and travels faster in search of moisture.&nbsp; That's why it's advantageous to make substrates a tad dry.&nbsp; You can always dunk before first flush to hydrate it then.&nbsp; The other thing that will lead to faster colonization is a less-nutritious substrate.&nbsp; Thus, a superior product like rice bran will colonize slower than brown rice flour, but makes up for it at fruiting time.<br />RR","title":"Re: why so slow"}}
