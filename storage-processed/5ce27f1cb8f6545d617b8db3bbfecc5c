I gave them a very heavy misting last night before bed to bring humidity up to 99% and try to rehydrate them a bit. This morning the humidity was back down to about 80%, so I have covered up about half the side holes. In addition, I took the cakes out and re-raked the perlite with my hands/fingers to aerate it a bit in case it was packed (preventing airflow from bottom to top and thus lowering humidity).</blockquote><br />You fixed what wasn't broken.&nbsp; You don't make changes and get pins the next day, period. The mushrooms were going to pin anyway.<br />Untape the holes and provide brighter light.<br />Toss out any cheap hygrometer, which means any hygrometer you get that says <u>made in china</u>, because they're only produced to separate you from your money and they don't work.<br />There's no way a shotgun terrarium had only 80% humidity.&nbsp; They'll always be at 95% or greater.<br />RR","title":"Re: Blue myc and no fruiting"}}
