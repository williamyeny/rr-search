Egg shells are great in a garden where they have years to break down.&nbsp; However, the lifespan of a casing layer is measured in weeks, not years or even months.<br />You want hydrated lime to raise the pH.&nbsp; Get it at animal feed stores if your local plant nursery doesn't carry it.<br />RR"}}
