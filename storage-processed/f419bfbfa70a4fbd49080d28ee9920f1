It's caused by improper sterile procedure when it forms in colonizing brf/grains, and it's caused by improper air exchange when it forms in casing layers.<br />Dunking in peroxide will not kill Trichoderma<br />You need to immediately toss out any jars you find with green mold.  If you cut into it, all you do is release billions of spores that are going to contaminate your next crops.  There is nothing to look at under a microscope.  The green is the spores from the trichoderma mycelium which is also white, like mushroom mycelium.<br />As said, If your jar had green mold when you birthed it, either your inoculation procedure was poor, or your filter didn't do its job.  If the green was right at the top by the verm barrier(assuming pf tek) it got in that way.  If it grew from an inoculation point, it got in that way.  Remember, trich spores are in the air everywhere, especially your house now.  Good luck.<br />I'll move this thread to the contamination forum.<br />RR","title":"Re: Wtf is this sh*t??
