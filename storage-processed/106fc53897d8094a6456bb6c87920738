Hay is taken from the ends of the stalks and has lots of seeds/grains still attached.  It's better for animal feed, but will contaminate a bulk project because grains must be kept totally sterile until colonized.  In addition, straw is hollow and holds water, which hay does not do as well.  Here's a microscope picture of straw.  You can see why it's such a good moisture reservoir, and why mycelium loves it.  There's lots of passageways for the mycelium to colonize and digest.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-006/108452877-SEM_of_Straw.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-006/108452877-thumb_SEM_of_Straw.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Bulk Straw Questions"}}
