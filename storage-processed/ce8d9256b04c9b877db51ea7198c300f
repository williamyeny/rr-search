There is absolutely no need or reason to even attempt to keep a greenhouse sterile.  We use sterile procedure to colonize grains, but once they're colonized, everything else is done in normal air.  You don't need a fan to provide air exchange in a greenhouse.  Simply take a knife and slice the plastic from top to bottom in a few places.  This will allow normal room air to circulate into and out of the mini greenhouse.  Use a coolmist humidifier (or two) depending on size to provide humidity, not air exchange.  Trays of damp, well drained perlite placed on empty shelf spaces and the floor will help to catch drips and return them to the air as humidity.<br />To repeat, a mini-greenhouse should have high humidity and high air exchange, with very bright high frequency lights such as natural daylight fluorescent on a 12/12 cycle for best results.  Don't waste time stressing over filters or other means of scrubbing the air.  It isn't necessary.<br />RR"}}
