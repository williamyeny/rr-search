It's normal for fruits you pick to bruise blue/green where damaged.  If your substrate has green places other than where you just picked or touched, that's likely mold and you need to take it outside for the safety of your future crops, not your own health.  I don't see any obvious contamination, but you'll have to get a better camera to get a proper diagnosis.  <br />Rememeber, there are no green mold contaminants of mushroom culture that will kill you.  That is an urban mycomyth.  If your substrate or fruits stink, it's from bacteria and that can cause food poisoning if you fail to dry or boil the fruits into tea.<br />RR","title":"Re: do these shrooms look contaminated?"}}
