That is a fact of physics so raising temperature is the wrong approach.<br />Secondly, condensation on the walls only indicates that the temperature of the walls is equal to or less than the dewpoint of the terrarium, and is not an indication of humidity.  In other words, condensation indicates a temperature differential and not moisture content.<br />Third, you want damp, but not wet perlite.  Be sure to drain the perlite well in a colander before placing into the terrarium.  If you'll make the damp perlite three to four inches thick, you'll see 95% to 99% humidity.<br />Definitely don't heat a terrarium.  That's a fundamental mistake made by many new growers.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: How to keep high humidity?"}}
