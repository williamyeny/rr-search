If the question were phrased, \"is it ok to eat raw animal feed with mold, or is it ok to eat unprocessed peanut butter with molds\" the answer would be different.  Eating a mushroom from a cake or casing with penicillium, aspergillis, or trichoderma is however, safe.  Green molds are very common in the commercial mushroom industry, and I can assure you from first hand knowledge, they do not toss out mushrooms that are harvested from a cased substrate when green molds are present, nor does the FDA even suggest they do so in federally inspected mushroom farms.  I'm just trying to end a very long held bit of disinformation that circulates around the OMC.  Green molds are toxic to your mushroom mycelium, but not to people unless they chop up a line and snort the spores directly, in which case they may have a histamine type reaction if they're allergic.  Toss out cakes or casings as soon as you discover green.  You will be far ahead by doing so.  Just feel free to eat any mushrooms you harvest.  Toxins (other than heavy metals) are not passed from the myclium to the fruitbody.  That is a well established fact.<br />RR","title":"Re: Safe to eat mushrooms off of a cake with green mold?"}}
