Air exchange is the number one pinning trigger.  I've made clear from the start that when you drill a lot of holes in an FC, that you should use three to five inches of well drained perlite.  He had 1 1/2 to 2 inches, thus humidity was too low.<br />Secondly, UVB is the wrong light source.  Mushrooms are not reptiles.  Room lighting is even worse if it's incandescent.  Incandescent light bulbs have a color temperature of 3,000 Kelvin, and mushrooms pin best with a higher color temperature in the 5,000 to 7,000 Kelvin range.  I suggest 'natural daylight fluorescent' with a color temperature of 6,500 Kelvin.<br />Major pinning triggers are, in order of importance: Full colonization, Fresh air with the corresponding decrease in CO2 levels, 98% to 100% humidity, evaporaton of moisture from the substrate, and last but not least, bright high frequency light. Put all of those factors together and watch them explode.   Good luck.<br />RR"}}
