If you live in a country where it's stronger than 3%, dilute with distilled water to get to that level, but in the US, the peroxide sold in drug and grocery stores is already 3%.  You need to wet the entire casing layer, and repeat three times at 8 to 12 hour intervals to wipe it out.  Don't wait for it to come back.  Hit it three times and it will be gone.  You'll see the mold melt and disappear.<br />If any green shows up, dispose of it outside in a manure or compost pile and it will recover if temperatures are right.<br />RR"}}
