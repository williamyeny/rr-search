It's fine if the grains smell a bit fermented after the soak.  This just means the bacteria has germinated and will now be easier to kill in the PC.  Another thing that really helps is to rinse the grains very well before the soak.  Put the grains in a pot, then fill with water.  Stir it around and dump the water out.  You'll see all the chaf and grain dust wash out.  Do this two or three times until the water you pour off is clean.  All that crap you rinse off is a lot of what causes grains to stick and clump up.  I do the 36 hour soak in weak coffee with gypsum and lime added.<br />RR"}}
