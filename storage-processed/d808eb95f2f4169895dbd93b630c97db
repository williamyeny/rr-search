Remember though, when you have a contamination outbreak in the greenhouse, the spores are going to coat the face of your flowhood, then blow out on your sterile work if you're not careful.<br />Before starting my flowhood, I always Lysol it down on all six sides, which includes the face.  Spray the lysol right into the face of the hood, and let it sit for a minute or two before starting the hood up. While you wait is a good time to fog the room with Oust too. Always let your flow hood run for at least an hour before starting sterile work so it can blow any surviving contaminants away before you begin.  It will also greatly reduce the ambient contaminant load during this time.<br />RR"}}
