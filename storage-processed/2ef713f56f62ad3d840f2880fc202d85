The other half is still in its box.  When it gets dirty, I remove it from the box and turn it around to use the other end.  A 10 X 10 would work fine.  The larger prefilters are for if you're going to build a box for the filter to set in.  I found that unnecessary.  My setup looks ghetto, but works fine.  Been using it for five years now.<br />RR"}}
