Cased substrates in a terrarium usually need no extra humidification, as evaporation from the casing layer supplies all that is needed.  Cakes in a terrarium do very well with perlite humidification.<br />In my opinion, save the humidifiers for mini-greenhouses, and have them on a timer or humidistat.<br />RR"}}
