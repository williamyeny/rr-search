The idea is to immerse the cake or other substrate under water for a given amount of time in order to replace moisture that has been lost.  Soaking/dunking before first flush allows you to make your substrates a bit on the dry side, which results in faster colonization.<br />I use regular tap water.  If the water in your area is nasty, use spring or distilled.  The water need not be sterile.<br />Most people soak for 24 hours under refrigeration.  The reason for using the refrigerator is that in the anaerobic environment under water, bacteria will flourish if left at room temperature.  The cold seems to slow down the bacteria enough that they aren't a problem.<br />I recommend washing the substrate under the faucet before and especially after the soak.<br />For the 'dunk and roll' use dry verm.  Roll the wet cake in the dry verm so that the verm sticks to the cake.  Afterwards, use a mister to wet the verm down so it can act like a casing layer.  I think most growers, including me, put the dry verm in the oven for half an hour or so to kill off any mold spores that might have landed on it.  Verm is inert so doesn't need to be sterilized.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dunking questions"}}
