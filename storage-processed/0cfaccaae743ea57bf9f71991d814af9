Cut a 5/8 hole and stick a water hose into it, and run this into you're terrarium.  Now, take a pair of vice grips or whatever you have, and pinch the hose until just enough moisture passes through it to maintain humidity.  You can leave it on 24/7 without a timer if you pinch the hose down enough.  Experiment until you get it right. ","title":"Re: Calling all Arizona Growers--I GIVE UP"}}
