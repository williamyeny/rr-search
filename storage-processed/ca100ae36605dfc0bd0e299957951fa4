They're awesome fruiting containers.  There is NO need to ever expose them to heat.  Simply take your contaminated projects outside and dump them in the garden or trash.  Rinse the tray with the garden hose, then bring it in and wash with soap and water.  If you want to get really anal, you can rub it down with alcohol after washing.<br />We use the PC to kill bacteria and bacterial endospores, not molds.  Molds just get killed off in the process, but the pc is not necessary for them.<br />RR"}}
