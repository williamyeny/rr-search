The gauge is a mechanical thingy which could be way out of calibration. The weight, on the other hand, relies on a very simple physics principle, and has no calibration. For a certain aperture size (the nipple opening as determined by the weight inside diameter), a fixed amount of pressure is needed to lift the weight.<br />Regards,<br />Terry</blockquote><br />This is not entirely correct.&nbsp; The weight/nozzle interface is a precision-milled mating surface.&nbsp; As the weight jiggles on the nozzle over time, wear occurs.&nbsp; When this wear opens up the nozzle to a larger opening, it pushes the weight off at a lower pressure.&nbsp; Many AA owners think they have a faulty gauge after a few years, when in fact it's the nozzle/weight combination which is showing wear, resulting in a lower pressure.&nbsp; When this happens, the two should be replaced as a unit together.<br />RR","title":"Re: PC and PSI (but it seemed so big)"}}
