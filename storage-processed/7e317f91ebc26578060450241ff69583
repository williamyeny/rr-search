However, such an isolate must be kept in a test tube slant under refrigeration in order to last very long.<br />When growing from spores, it makes little difference what the 'name' is on the print or syringe you use.  Fruiting strains can be isolated from just about any print with many different and wildly divergent presentations.  <br />For this reason, we try to keep discussion of strains in the strain thread stickied at the top of the page.  A few months ago the boards were littered with dozens of 'strain' posts active at the same time, making it hard to find information.  I'll close the thread so you can continue the discussion above if you wish.<br />RR"}}
