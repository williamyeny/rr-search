Let your poor mycelium recover and grow. With popcorn, the kernels are so large, there is not much surface area there to colonize, so the jars get done in a week to ten days.  Shake at initial inoculation, then don't shake again.   With rye, you will gain ground by shaking once at about 25 to 35 percent colonization.  I saw no such benefit with popcorn.<br />RR","title":"Re: to shake, or not to shake. Popcorn"}}
