In the flat plane of the petri dish, there is no appreciable heating that could be detected with an IR camera.  The mycelium showed the same heat signature as the ambient surface of the agar surrounding it.<br />Growth peaked between 75F and 81F, then fell off slightly at 82F, and began a rapid slide down at 83F and above.  By 86F, the <i>rate of growth</i> had slowed to about 60% of what it was in the 75F to 81F range.  Since this figure contradicted what I had read so many times before, I repeated the experiments several times with various strains.  The results were always the same.<br />The significant part of this experiment showed that <i>rate of growth </i>did not increase at all by heating above 75F. However, at higher temperatures, bacteria and thermophilic molds are stimulated.  This is why I recommend colonizing at 'normal' room temperature.<br />Those who have followed this and used room temperature colonization have generally been in agreement on these figures.  If your colonization room is less than 75F, find a way to elevate the temperature to that level, but I've found no need or benefit to heat beyond that level, and lots of reasons not to.<br />RR","title":"Re: Too much light is bad!"}}
