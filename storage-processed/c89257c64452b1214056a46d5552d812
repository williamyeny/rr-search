With some species, it's required for fruits to form.  With cubes, a casing layer is optional, but unless you have a way of maintaining nearly 100% humidity at the substrate level, it's hard to get a really good pinset.  With tray culture, a sheet of wax paper can help, but the other job of a casing layer is to supply moisture for the flush, which wax paper can not.<br />Two plusses for uncased substrates is they are contaminant resistant, where often the uncolonized portions of a casing layer can become contaminated, and you get fruits sooner when not waiting for a casing layer to colonize before initiating pinning.<br />With uncased substrates(or cased for that matter), you can use a syringe to inject water into the interior.<br />RR"}}
