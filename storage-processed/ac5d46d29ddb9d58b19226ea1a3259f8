I read in the above mentioned book that brown rice flour makes the mushrooms considerably more potent than rye berries: \"Up to 1% alkaloid content by dry weight.\" Why would you use rye berries then?<br />5. This book also mentions pasteurized horse manure as a casing. I thought manure was supposed to be a substrate, NOT a casing? And even if you can use it as a casing, why over-complicate things? In other words, what's wrong with vermiculite or peat moss? *shrug*<br />I'm confused by the whole thing. </blockquote><br />Hopefully, you just read it wrong.  I've never read the book, but if it says that brf produces more potent mushrooms than grains, it's full of shit.  Potency is genetic.<br />Again, I hope you just read it wrong, because horse manure is a substrate, never a casing.  It would be hard to imagine someone publishing a book without submitting it for peer review prior to printing.<br />RR","title":"Re: I just read Psilocybin Handbook, but..."}}
