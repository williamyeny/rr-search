You can set the TRAY on perlite, but I don't recommend setting the substrate on perlite, and certainly not verm.  If it waterlogs, performance will fall. For a substrate to pin properly, moisture needs to be <i>leaving</i> the substrate.  If it's waterlogged, it has a constant moisture content and performance will fall off or stop.<br />RR"}}
