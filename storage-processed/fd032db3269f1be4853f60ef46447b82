But then just today i tried the less effective damp towel</blockquote><br />Wrong.<br />The salt test is not an accurate method of calibrating for a fruiting chamber, but the damp towel is.&nbsp; Hygrometers are only accurate through a very narrow band, so you need to calibrate at the operating level.<br />Cubensis will fruit in the 90's but the stems will generally be hollow and potency will not be as high.<br />You can always drop the temp five to ten degrees by laying a damp towel over the FC and pointing a fan at it.&nbsp; Re-wet the towel when it dries out.<br />RR"}}
