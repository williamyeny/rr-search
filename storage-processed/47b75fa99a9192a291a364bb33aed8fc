If you shake a grain jar after inoculation you get rapid, more spread out growth as opposed to not shaking it...</blockquote><br />Not so.&nbsp; If one inoculates with spores, it's best to let them germinate in close proximity to each other so they can match up and become dikaryotic.&nbsp; At that time, shake to distribute the grains.&nbsp; Shaking early causes monokaryotic mycelium to colonize large parts of the grains, and it grows slower than dikaryotic mycelium.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />ive been trying to find that post where the guy claimed to have shaken it every day and received amazingly fast colonization time.</blockquote><br />That was a noob without a clue.&nbsp; He was growing mold and didn't know it.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium needs 48 hours after shaking to fully recover.&nbsp; If you shake every day, the mycelium never recovers and eventually dies.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shake grains right after inoculation"}}
