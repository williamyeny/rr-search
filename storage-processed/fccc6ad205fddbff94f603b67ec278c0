Why complicate what is better done simply?  It's like trying to improve a horse by grafting a fifth leg onto it.  I'm an electrical engineer and computer automation designer(I worked for many years for a guy named Bill in Redmond, WA), yet I use perlite terrariums with holes drilled into them for air exchange.<br />My greenhouse is just as simple.  Humidifiers sit on the bottom shelf, so they exhaust their mist upward.  Slits cut from floor to ceiling provide constant air exchange.   My edibles greenhouse is the same way, except with the addition of a refrigeration unit to maintain cooler temps for cold weather mushrooms.<br />RR"}}
