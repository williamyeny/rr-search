I can't type this enough, NO standing water should be left in perlite unless you want to breed bacteria and lower your FC's humidity.  Perlite should be washed under the faucet, then allowed to drain in a spaghetti strainer before being dumped into the FC. There is no reason to worry about sterilizing perlite. We're using it in a fruiting chamber, and those by definition are not sterile. Adding peroxide is a waste of product.  Bacteria need standing water to multiply to levels that will affect your crop, and peroxide breaks down in a matter of hours or less in the presence of bacteria or other organic compounds, rendering it useless.<br />RR","title":"Re: Quick Q- PERLITE....Sterile???"}}
