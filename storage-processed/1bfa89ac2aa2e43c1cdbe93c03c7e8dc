I don't even use an incubator for jars which only rise a few degrees over ambient temps.  I've looked at colonizing bags of manure, grains and straw through an infrared imaging device and noticed up to a 12F increase in temperature over ambient.  <br />With the ambient temperature in your tit and the heating from the substrate bag, you approached 100F which is very well suited for molds and thermophilic bacteria that won't activate at room temperature, and drastically slowed down the mushroom mycelium, which LOVES room temperature, resulting in contamination.<br />Toss it out.  There's no saving contaminated grains.<br />RR"}}
