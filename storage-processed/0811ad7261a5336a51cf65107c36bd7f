It is not a buffer.  It will raise the ph.  A buffer is used to resist changes in ph.  An excellent buffer is gypsum.  For peat based casings, I add 1/2 tablespoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat in the mix.   Don't count the verm when figuring out how much lime to use.  For coir(which I hate as a casing material) use half that amount.<br />RR","title":"Re: Buffers"}}
