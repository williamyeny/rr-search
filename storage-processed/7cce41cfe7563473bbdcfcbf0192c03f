Mushrooms are 90% water and benefit greatly from misting.<br />The other benefit to misting is to replenish moisture in the casing layer or on the surface of the cake.  You can't do that with humidity, even at 100%.  It must be done by misting.  Opening the lid of a fruiting chamber a few times per day is a great idea.  A total influx of fresh air is always good for the pinning/fruiting mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: can you have too much humidity?"}}
