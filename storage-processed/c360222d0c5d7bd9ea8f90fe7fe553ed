There are other losses involved as stated above.  You also need to remember those figures are for a brand new filter.  As it gets clogged up, you need to allow for that as well.<br />As said above, my 12 X 24 flowhood is perfect with a 650 cfm blower.  I wouldn't shoot for the minimum size that could possibly work.
