You can make an lc out of distilled water and karo, with no heat treatment.  I've done it many times, but bear in mind, I only allow it to grow for a week to ten days max.  No PC doesn't mean not to follow sterile procedures.  I make it in front of a flow hood.<br />I prefer barley malt and yeast for LC, but of course it must be sterilized.  I rarely however make liquid cultures anymore for the amounts I grow.  It's easier to simply get one or two quart jars of rye colonized, then turn each of those into ten more via grain to grain transfers, and each of those into ten more.  That can deliver one to two hundred colonized quart jars of grain within a month to six weeks, which would overflow even the largest of martha type greenhouses.  <br />RR","title":"Re: h202 liquid culture"}}
