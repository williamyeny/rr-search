Soap and water don't clean the air, only the surfaces, and you don't dump your product out on the floor of the glovebox anyway.  Just wipe down the surfaces and then go to work.  Still air is . . .still.  That's all you want or care about.  When you move to a laminar flow hood you'll need to much more careful about cleaning the surfaces that are in the airflow, because the fan will blow contaminants up and into your work if the table and racks, etc., are not cleaned very well.<br />RR"}}
