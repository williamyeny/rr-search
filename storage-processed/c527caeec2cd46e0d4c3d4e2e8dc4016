Why would you colonize jars at 90?  Any temperature INside the jar over 83F will begin to slow down the growth of mycelium. At the same time, high temperatures favor thermophilic molds and bacteria.  The 75F you're trying to fruit at is fine for colonization AND fruiting.<br />Condensation on the sides of the FC do not have a relationship to humidity at all.  Condensation indicates a temperature differential.  You need to fan your terrarium more than twice per day.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: fruiting temperature question"}}
