You're not going to get much encouragement from those of us who have grown before because we realize this isn't something to automate. I even manually control conditions in my mushroom farm.&nbsp; <br />You won't be able to use transducers because they either short out or their capacitance changes at high humidity, rendering them useless.&nbsp; It takes eyeballs to know when to mist, not a timer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Full Automation of Aeration and Humidification for the Shotgun Tub"}}
