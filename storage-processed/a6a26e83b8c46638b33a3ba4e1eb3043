They have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_Filtration_Efficiency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">BFE</a> (bacteria) and PFE (particles) of 98%. The Fluid Resistance is low end (80 mmHg). Do I need to track down some N95 face masks or should the above cut it? N95 is the best there is, capable of protecting you from airborne diseases like TB and influenza.</blockquote><br />N95 is worthless for mycology.&nbsp; The masks you linked are OK.&nbsp; We're not trying to protect ourselves from our mushroom cultures.&nbsp; We're trying to protect them from us.&nbsp; Use surgical gloves and masks.&nbsp; Surgical masks are designed to filter exhaled bacteria, not inhaled solids.<br />It doesn't matter if tyvek or cotton sleeves are sterile or not.&nbsp; They just need to be clean.&nbsp; The purpose is to capture dead skin cells which flake off your arms by the millions, to prevent them swirling into your sterile media.<br />RR"}}
