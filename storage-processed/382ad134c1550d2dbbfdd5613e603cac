The soap serves as a wetting agent to help hydrate the straw faster.&nbsp; It also helps to knock back some of the contaminants prior to pasteurization. Then, all you do is strain the straw out and place into the pasteurization water at 140F/60C for 90 minutes or so.&nbsp; Then, remove and place it on a rack to drain and inoculate when cool.&nbsp; <br />You don't have to rinse the soap out.&nbsp; Enough will leach out into the pasteurization water that the mycelium will colonize just fine.<br />RR"}}
