Mexicana mycelium does get denser in some areas more than others and that is most likely what you're seeing.  Time will tell.

I've also found considerably better sclerotia formation when the grains are hydrated with coffee prior to sterilization.<br />RR","title":"Re: OMFG Mexicana A + Barley = sclorota prod in 3-5 days!!!!!!!!"}}
