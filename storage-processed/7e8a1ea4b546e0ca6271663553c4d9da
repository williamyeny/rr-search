That's why it didn't finish colonizing. To the mycelium, it HAS finshed colonizing, because when it ran up against the natural barrier of the contamination, it was just like running up against the edge of the bag.  The pin that set is a response to distress.  The mycelium senses that it's time to reproduce and/or die, so it sets a fruit body to produce spores. It has nothing to do with light or no light.  <br />Yes, you can tear the colonized portion off, wash the ball of mycelium under the faucet with running water to remove all non-colonized substrate and contaminant spores, and then set it in fruiting conditions as a cake or use as spawn to manure.  Personally, I'd stick with the former.  If you fruit it as a cake, roll it in dry verm after you wash it, then spray the verm well with a mister once you have the cake in a terrarium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Issue with Mycobag"}}
