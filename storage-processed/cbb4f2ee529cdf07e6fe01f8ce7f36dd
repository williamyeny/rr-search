Use normal cool white fluorescents.  One of the 'bluest' lights you can get is going to be metal halide, but it's serious overkill for mushroom growing.  A 'mood light' with a blue lense is NOT blue light.  When they say 'blue' they refer to the frequency of the light waves, with the blue end of the spectrum near the top, or highest frequency.  MH comes closest and if you ever grow mushrooms in the same room with an mj grow, you'll see an increase in pinning activity from the MH light.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pinning Questions"}}
