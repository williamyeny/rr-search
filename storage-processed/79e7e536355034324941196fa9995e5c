Horse manure and straw are what we call 'bulk substrates'.  'Casing' is the layer we put over the top to provide a micro-climate favorable to fruiting as well as moisture to sustain the flush.<br />You can mix the cow manure with the straw, but if it's the bagged manure from a nursery, use no more than just enough to make the straw 'dirty', no more than 10% or so by volume the amount of straw.<br />You'll crumble your cakes into the straw, then wait for that to colonize, then add your casing layer.  Do a search for bulk substrates.  That should give a bit more info on procedures.  Also, look up 'pasteurization', as the straw/manure needs to be pasteurized, not sterilized.<br />For a first grow, I'd suggest just crumbling your cakes and casing them with 50/50 peat/verm.  After you get a bit of experience, go for the bulk substrates since there's a lot more places to screw up with bulk.<br />RR","title":"Re: what is the Ph concerns of straw/manure casting??"}}
