Wipe down the micropore tape with alcohol before injecting through it. This ensures you're not cross-contaminating between jars.  <br />I doubt seriously that air movement in your closet is to blame.  I colonize jars on an open shelf in my bedroom, and they get plenty of moving, dirty air around them all the time.<br />Make sure you're using fine vermiculite for the filter.  Course will not stop the mold spores as well.  using coffee filters over your jars to catch contaminants would be like trying to catch a gnat in a butterfly net.  They won't help.  If you want to keep dust/mold spores off your jars, wrap a piece of tyvek over the top.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
