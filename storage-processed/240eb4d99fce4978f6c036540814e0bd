I was trying to convey a response from this phrase in the original post:<br />\"<i>The logic behind this is since they grow in flushes, the energy would be put back into the 200+ pins instead of being used for the larger ones.<br /></i>\"<br />all in all, the latter of the two options is not the wisest.</blockquote><br />When I say energy, I dont mean nutrition</blockquote><br />I'm curious what leads you to suspect the mushrooms are consuming energy rather than supplying it? At any rate, my experience from growing several million mushrooms is that picking early 'volunteers' isn't going to help deliver a better flush later.<br />RR"}}
