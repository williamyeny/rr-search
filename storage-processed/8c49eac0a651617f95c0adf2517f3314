Don't leave pieces behind.  You can fill the divots with fresh casing material but don't recase the whole thing because it won't colonize anyway.  Your mycelium has already gone from colonization mode into fruiting mode.<br />I like to let a cased substrate sit for a week after picking to 'rest'.  The reason is that they rarely flush right away anyway, so by letting it sit for a few days to a week, then watering heavily or dunking, you get an immediate second flush.  If you water it heavily right after picking, it just sits there wet, which can encourage molds.<br />RR"}}
