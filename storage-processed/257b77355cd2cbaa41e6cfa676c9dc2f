The number of holes is irrelevant if they're not large enough to provide 4 air exchanges per hour.<br />When a substrate is fully colonized, the pinning triggers then become increased air exchange, near 100% humidity with a steady rate of evaporation from the casing layer or substrate, and bright, high frequency or full spectrum lighting.  Natural daylight fluorescent is the best artificial lighting, with cool white fluorescent a close second.  Incandescent lighting is worst.  Fan often and increase your light exposure.<br />RR","title":"Re: myc piss + no pins"}}
