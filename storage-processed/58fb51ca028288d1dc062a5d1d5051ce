That means a 1000 watt lamp running for one hour, will burn 1 kwh.  In most areas, a kwh costs around ten cents.  That means a 250 watt heater would have to run 4 hours to equal a kwh, thus 10 cents worth of electricity, provided it didn't shut off during that time.  A 100 watt light bulb would run ten hours to equal 1 kwh, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: Electricity Question"}}
