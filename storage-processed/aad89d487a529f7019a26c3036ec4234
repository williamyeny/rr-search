Just set the tray in the sink and let it fill up with water under the faucet, so the running water overflows the top of the tray and down the drain.  Use something such as a jar of water or a clean rock to hold the substrate down so it won't float.  After a couple of hours, place back into the fruiting chamber.  After the dunk, you should be able to keep up with moisture content by misting a few times per day.<br />Next time, if you'll add peat to the verm it will be easier to read moisture content by the color.  It's hard to judge moisture in plain vermiculite. <br />With cased substrates, the majority of your total harvest will come in the first two flushes.  Also, after the second flush, your chances of contaminant molds increases, so keep a close eye on them and toss out anything you see with green molds. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing too dry? w/ pictures"}}
