Some strains seem to be better at pinning in low light conditions, while others require much more.   The other pinning triggers of full colonization, steady evaporation of moisture, and air exchange are much more critical than light.<br />As a general rule however, pinsets will be better with bright, full spectrum lighting over dim/darker conditions.<br />RR"}}
