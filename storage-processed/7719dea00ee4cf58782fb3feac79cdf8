I consider 80F ambient to be the maximum.  I don't AC my place in the summer until August or so, and I've noticed during hot weather, colonization is slower.  As said, 90F won't 'kill' your mycelium, but it certainly will slow it down.<br />As CC said, holes OPEN.  The vermiculite is your filter. Your jars will stall if they run out of O2.<br />RR","title":"Re: HOLES"}}
