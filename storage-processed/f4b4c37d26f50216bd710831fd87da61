It's the old 'know your enemy' thingie I suppose.  Anyway, here's a picture of cobweb for those of you who haven't seen it or know what it is yet. On the surface of a cake or casing, it will not be nearly as dense as it is on nutrient rich agar.  However, you can see it's grey, not snow white like mushroom mycelium.<br />Cobweb mold can easily be defeated by spraying the 3% peroxide available at drug and grocery stores full strength from the bottle right onto the mold.  Mushroom mycelium can survive the peroxide, but it's death to cobweb.  <br />Cobweb is the only major contaminant I recommend trying to save a project from.  If the mold on your project is green, toss it out right away as soon as you discover it.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/577079997-Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-16/577079997-thumb_Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg\"></a>","title":"Cobweb picture for identification purposes"}}
