They'll fruit just fine at 80F.  Treat them like cubes only with a thinner substrate.  I go with no more than 1 1/2\" thick manure substrate, with 1/4\" to 1/3\" peat/verm casing layer.   They need a tad longer than cubes to pin generally.<br />Contaminants grow on substrates like any mycelium, and if they get a head start will ruin any grow.  Copes are no more susceptible to them than other species.<br />RR"}}
