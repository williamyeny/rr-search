Most of us have learned the hard way not to click on offsite images.<br />It sounds like you're trying to fruit without allowing your casing layer to colonize.  92% is too low for fruiting.  You want near 100% humidity and lots of fresh air.  However, you don't introduce to light and fresh air until your mycelium is poking through the top.  If you introduce to fruiting conditions at the time you apply the casing layer, performance is greatly reduced.  You want to keep a high CO2 environment with little or no light during the week to ten days of casing colonization, and then introduce all the major pinning triggers at the same time.<br />RR"}}
