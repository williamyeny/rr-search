Swipe your spores on agar using an inoculation loop.  Transfer EVERY growth you see to its own new dish as soon as it becomes visible.  This way, as the contaminant and mushroom spores germinate, each will be isolated from the others.  Later, you can toss the dishes that turn out to be contaminant molds, while keeping the dishes that are pure mycelium, and use those for your growing.<br />RR"}}
