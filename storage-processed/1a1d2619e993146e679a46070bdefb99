There is nothing you can do.  We don't live in a sterile environment. Personally, I'm with dcyans.  I also don't mist by routine with bleach water.  Others do.  All the bleach will do is to help prevent the trich spores from germinating.  If you're having problems with trich, I'd say the first step would be to increase air circulation.  Trich and the more common cobweb mold prefer still, stale air.  If you're still plagued by trich, then try the teaspoon per gallon added to your misting water.  My personal method is as soon as a casing is made, I lay a sheet of wax paper over it.  This serves two purposes.  One, contaminant spores land on the wax paper and not on the casing.  Two, it holds in the moisture and for the most part eliminates the need for misting.  Don't seal the wax paper around the edges, simply lay it flat over your casing.  If you have an already established casing, DON'T put wax paper over it.  Trich spores have already landed, and the wax paper will facilitate germination. The wax paper tek is only to be used if you do it from the very day you build the casing.  Change the piece of wax paper every second day with a fresh one.","title":"Re: bleach spray on casing need answer"}}
