Foil is no filter.<br />Read up on filtered gas exchange.&nbsp; You can use dry verm if it's a brf jar, or tyvek, polyfill, synthetic filter disks, or even micropore tape if a grain jar.&nbsp; The pore size of whatever you used for a filter needs to be smaller than the smallest contaminant particle floating in the air.&nbsp; My favorite is synthetic filter disks because they're made from PFTE and can be used over and over again hundreds of times.<br />RR","title":"Re: is air required during mycelium growth after spore injection during colonization"}}
