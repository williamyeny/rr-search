At 160F, it would take 12 hours or longer for the inside of a 5 pound substrate bag to reach 140F.  You're only supposed to pasterurize for an hour, to an hour and a half maximum, so by the time your substrate or casing material reached the right temp in the center, the outside is partially sterilized.  Use water to pasteurize.  Water is a much better heat conductor than air, which can only transfer the heat by convection.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can't you just oven pasteurize at 160F in the oven?"}}
