Paper isn't a good medium to print on due to the acids and caustic materials used in paper making.&nbsp; I've had VERY poor results with more than 2 year old prints on paper.&nbsp; Prints over 5 years old are nearly impossible to use, if made on paper.<br />If you're going to use the prints within a year, paper is fine, but don't count on it for long term storage.<br />RR"}}
