I see no reason for building an incubator in the first place.  If the room is comfortable for you to sit in with a t-shirt on, it's warm enough for your mushroom mycelium.  Remember, trich and cobweb are favored at higher temps.  Mushroom myc will do very well at 70F.  The jars may colonize a day or two earlier if you elevate the temp, but contams will also thrive at the higher temperature.  Just put your jars on a bookshelf and let normal room temperature do its thing.  No reason to keep them in the dark either.  That's another myth we need to dispell.","title":"Re: Going out of town for spring break, should i unplug my incubator?"}}
