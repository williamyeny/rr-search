You can bury it into a pile of manure in a shady spot in your yard though. <br />Molds are killed by very low temperatures, so if you PC'd the rye, the mold spores were introduced later.<br />When you soak/simmer with coffee, use no more than 25 percent of the soak water as coffee.  About half drinking strength seems to work very well.<br />RR"}}
