If you get an awesome pinset on a cake, expect 80% of them to abort.  Pick off the aborts when you pick the flush, but don't pick any pins that aren't black.  Often, pins for the first two or three flushes set at the same time as pins set for the first flush.  Once you pick the first flush off and dunk, they'll take off and grow.<br />RR","title":"Re: Too many pins, not enough mushrooms..."}}
