Often, the primordia for the first several flushes are set at the time of first flush, so they might just be still dormant.  It's very important to mist with a very fine mist, and immediately increase air exchange in order to absorb into, or dry the water off, the surface of the fruits.<br />Try increasing your air exchange and see if some of the primordia start to grow.  If not, let the tray sit for several days dormant, then dunk and repeat the process.<br />RR","title":"Re: I'm pretty sure I aborted my pins..."}}
