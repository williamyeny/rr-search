I quit my day job last march to work full time on the video.  I doubt seriously that I'll be selling it on my site anyway.  It will be in bookstores and amazon.com.  I should really take the link to my site down since I don't have time for it.<br />There is a full hour on the DVD about nothing but agar work, so I'm sure it will help out.  I haven't paid vendors fees here yet, and don't want to be appearing to spam, so I'll leave it at that.  I'm nearly done though.  All I'll say is it will be unlike any other video.  In addition, I come out of the closet and use my real name and face.  All teks are demonstrated with legal edible and medicinals.  The teks will be the same for cubes of course, but I think the time is ripe for mainstream gardening people to move into mushrooms.  There's also a tremendous amount of people who have, or know someone with cancer who would benefit from the information on Shiitake and other medicinals.<br />For those who don't know, mrs rabbit was diagnosed with cancer last year.  She recently finished chemotherapy and still has ALL her hair.  Everybody she entered chemo with got their asses kicked, but she was still doing ten mile backpack trips all the way through chemo.  We credit the massive amounts of medicinal mushrooms we eat daily.  Her doctor was completely amazed.  He had never seen anything like it.  She actually gained weight during chemotherapy.  It was her cancer that actually propelled me into medicinal mushrooms with a passion, so it looks like some good might just come from the illness.<br />RR","title":"Re: how do you make slants?"}}
