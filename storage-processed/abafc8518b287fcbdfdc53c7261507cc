Walk up and knock on the door and politely ask if you can scoop up some manure for your garden.  I have never, not even once had a private horse owner turn me down.  They're glad to get rid of the stuff, trust me.  If your town has a mounted police department, go to the stables and ask the same thing.  Here, the officer that takes care of the horses even helps shovel it into my bag.<br />RR","title":"Re: Buying Manure?"}}
