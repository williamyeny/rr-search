It doesn't matter if you use one inch of rye to three inches of manure, or one pound of rye to three pounds of manure, or one truckload of rye to three truckloads of manure.  Just use one to three(or four), but make sure the 1 and the 3 are based on the same unit of measure.<br />RR","title":"Re: grain, poo ratio"}}
