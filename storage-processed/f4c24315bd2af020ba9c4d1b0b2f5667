They're required.  In addition, you must provide a filter for your lids.  You can just cover the holes in the lid with foil.<br />The two jars you thought were 'saturated' are contaminated with bacteria.  You'll need to start over with a pressure cooker, and some tyvek, polyfill, or synthetic filter disks for the lids.  I'd also suggest quart jars over pints.  Read up on rye teks. Simply mixing water and rye in the jar is the least desirable method.<br />RR"}}
