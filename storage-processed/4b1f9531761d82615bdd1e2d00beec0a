Perhaps the sixteen holes allowed a bit too much gas exchange during colonization, eliminating that as a trigger.  I use smaller trays than that, but have them totally sealed up during colonization and casing run except for a couple of nail size pokes.  These allow the gasses to build up, then at full colonization when you expose to light, you also get the massive reduction in CO2 when actual air exchange begins.  Next time, try covering those holes except for one or two until full colonization.<br />RR"}}
