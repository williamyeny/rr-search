The holes on the bottom would simply drain any water out.<br />Third, perlite is a crystalline substance.&nbsp; It works by having a huge surface area relative to its mass.&nbsp; This large surface holds water, while providing the surface <i>area</i> to evaporate this water into the air, providing humidity.<br />Fourth, due to the fact that perlite is crystalline, it's physically impossible for it to 'wick up' water from anywhere.&nbsp; That would require an absorbent, and perlite by the nature of its structure isn't absorbent.&nbsp; Having a dry perlite layer on top would only 'seal' the moist perlite below, lowering humidity.<br />Fifth, fresh air exchange is the number ONE pinning trigger.&nbsp; It wouldn't matter squat if you had 100% humidity because without fresh air circulation, your projects would mold and either not pin at all or pin poorly.&nbsp; The reduction in CO2 levels is the major pinning trigger along with bright light as the main secondary pinning trigger.<br />The design of the shotgun terrarium produces maximum humidity while giving automated fresh air exchange.&nbsp; When you mist your substrates, the overspray re-moistens the perlite, thus keeping the system working throughout the growing cycle.<br />RR"}}
