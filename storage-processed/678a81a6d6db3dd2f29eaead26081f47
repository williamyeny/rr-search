Hold the mushroom upside down and tear the stem in half from the base to the cap.  Don't use a knife, just tear it.  This will expose some 'virgin' territory in the center of the stem.  Take your clone from there.<br />amazon,<br />we must have similar shifts.  I work four days on, four days off.  12 hour days.  The four days on kinda sux.
