Hardwood is best, but it's OK if Douglas fir is mixed in. I doubt you'll find Douglas fir much beyond the west coast of the US.&nbsp; Don't use pine.&nbsp; In the PNW, most landscapers get chipped wood as described above, and that's where the cyans will be found.<br />For expanding your spawn to inoculate the outdoor beds, you'll want sterilized hardwood chips/sawdust so try to find Oak, Alder, Birch, Apple, etc., that is available in your area. Don't use pine. Inoculate it with grain spawn. <br />RR"}}
