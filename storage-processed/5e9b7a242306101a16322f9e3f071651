That's how we learn.<br />The cake that is blue is under stress. It should not be sitting on all that verm.  Note the mycelium leaving the cake and trying to colonize the vermiculite, which has no food for it.  I'd suggest cutting the cake away from the vermiculite it's sitting on and slip a tray of some kind under it.<br />1,2. I don't recall ever seeing peanuts in WBS before, at least not in my area.   Mushrooms metabolize their food rather than conduct it into the fruitbody, so I can't imagine any peanut toxins being in a fruit, but there's always a chance part of the substrate could stick to the base, so best to play it safe and not use it.  Peanut allergies can be fatal.<br />3,4. It would be a waste to use peroxide in the soak water for two reasons.  One, you want the bacterial endospores to germinate and grow during the soak, so the pressure cooker can kill them.  Two, peroxide breaks down very fast in the presence of organic materials, so it would likely do nothing at all anyway.  It would be long gone by the time you boil.<br />5. Don't use peroxide in the mist water.  Peroxide injures mycelium, so to use it for a preventative against contaminants might cause the very problem you're trying to avoid by stressing the mycelium, weakening it.<br />6.  Looking good.  Keep up lots of air exchange.  It also might help to build a shelf to raise those trays off the floor of the unit so they won't drown in their own CO2 between fannings.<br />7.  That would appear to be cobweb mold.  Usually it has more of a grey color, but the picture might not be showing it well.  Any mycelium that grows that fast and airy, is cobweb mycelium.  This is the application for peroxide.  Spray the 3% peroxide from the grocery or drug store full strength on it and see if it melts and disappears on contact.  Cobweb spreads by breaking off tiny fragments of mycelium and sending them airborne to find new substrates, so watch all your projects for the first signs of it and hit them with full strength peroxide whenever you find it.  Just make sure the bottle of peroxide says 3%.  Don't use it as a preventative, but use it as treatment to kill cobweb.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Couple questions, couple pics."}}
