Obviously, any discussion is simply wondering 'what if', but to dismiss as irrelevant the moon cycles that farmers have known and used for thousands of years of crop growing is somewhat hard to understand.  I suppose folks who dismiss the unknown, also dismiss any possibility that the effects we feel from our mushrooms are any more than just a simple chemical reaction in our brains.
