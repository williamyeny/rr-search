A good portion of that was for gas considering the location and how far supplies had to be hauled to get them here.<br />We DO have the best honey anywhere.&nbsp; There's no farmland near us, so our bees are not exposed to pesticides.&nbsp; The nectar and pollen they collect is from wild raspberries, strawberries, thimble berries, plus apple, peach, pear and plum trees, and the millions of flower seeds we've spread around the area. There's also white and red clover in the meadows. Had we not kept all our honey for the bees and ourselves this year, we could have sold it many times over.&nbsp; We should get at least 1000 pounds of honey next year, but there's a steady stream of locals knocking on the door asking for it.&nbsp; I doubt we'll need to sell it online.<br />RR","title":"Re: Mountain Mushroom Farm"}}
