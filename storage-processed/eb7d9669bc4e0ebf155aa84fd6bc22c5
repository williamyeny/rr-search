In fact it's been around 10F the last few mornings.&nbsp; Just set your terrarium somewhere near the stove where it will maintain 75F or so.&nbsp; Don't heat the terrarium itself or your precious humidity will turn into condensation on the walls, and your crops will suffer.<br />Since wood heat tends to dry out the air in your house, get a couple of humidifiers and run them 24/7.&nbsp; I keep two coolmists running, one on each side of my wood stove.&nbsp; They make it nice and cozy inside and there's no static when I walk across the carpet and touch something metal.&nbsp; A rule of thumb is if you get shocked from touching stuff, the air in your house is too dry.<br />RR","title":"Re: Aquarium pump vinyl tubing question..."}}
