I also 'mist' the blocks with a water hose with my thumb over the end, so the water agitates the substrate pretty hard, but not hard enough to break it.&nbsp; This increases yield by as much as they're reporting with the electrical shocks.&nbsp; <br />I've got my sterilizers going around the clock now gearing up my shiitake farm, so I'll definitely be trying this and a few other tricks over the coming months.<br />RR"}}
