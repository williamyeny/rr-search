The current draw of the motor will actually decrease.<br />To the original poster, I'd go with the larger motor.&nbsp; You won't get 100% efficiency from any motor, plus you have to take into account loss from friction and the 90 degree turn the air makes as it pressurizes the plenum and passes out the filter.<br />RR"}}
