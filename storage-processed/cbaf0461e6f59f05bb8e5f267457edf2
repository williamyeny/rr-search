That defeats the whole purpose.  In fact, run your fingers through the perlite like a rake and fluff it up.  leave it irregular on the surface, not flat.  This exposes the maximum surface area of perlite to the air so it can evaporate.  If you pack it down, you're screwed.  It can't do its job.<br />RR"}}
