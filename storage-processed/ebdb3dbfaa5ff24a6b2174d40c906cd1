The wood chips should be soaked for three days.  This isn't to germinate endospores, but rather to hydrate the wood.<br />Also, it's best to supplement the sawdust/wood chips with up to 20% rice or wheat bran for nutrients.  This is the reason that substrate for woodlovers should be sterilized, rather than pasteurized.  If you skip the wheat or rice bran, a simple pasteurization will suffice, but performance will not be nearly as good.<br />RR"}}
