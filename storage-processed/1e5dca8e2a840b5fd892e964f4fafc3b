Use a vegetable steamer or trivet to elevate the jars totally out of the water.  The boiling water can easily splash up and get under your foil, thus entering the jars ruining them if they're down in the water.  If they're above the water, the steam will sterilize them without having water entering the jars.  Steam for 90 minutes, once the water comes to a boil.<br />RR"}}
