This is a cultivation forum.  Please treat it as such.</i><br />The easiest thing you can do is to cut a few slits in the top part of the bag with a knife to allow for better air exchange.  This will allow the fruits to develop normally.<br />I wouldn't recommend using this bag as spawn to manure because of the uncolonized portion.  There is usually a reason part of a substrate doesn't colonize.  The fruits will be fine to eat, but I wouldn't use it as spawn.  Wait for your next one to colonize.<br />RR","title":"Re: My bag started fruiting and its not done colonizing! What do I do?"}}
