In addition, there should be NO standing water in a fruiting chamber.  I also doubt seriously you can exchange enough air in that glass container to fruit oysters without drying the air out.  You need to make a much larger fruiting chamber so that you can exchange more air.   Oysters are extremely CO2 intolerant.  If they fruit at all, you'll get fat stems and little to no caps.<br />RR"}}
