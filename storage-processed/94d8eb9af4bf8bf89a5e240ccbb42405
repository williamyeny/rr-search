Corn is terrible about harboring bacterial endospores.  It also has a large surface area which means you have only a fraction of the mycelium per jar that you would have with other grains.  Remember, the mycelium colonizes the surface of the grains, so larger grains means less total grains in a jar, thus less surface area to colonize.
