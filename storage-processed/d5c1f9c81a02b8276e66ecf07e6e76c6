Moisture on the surface of the grains will only interfer with colonization.  Grains prepared on the dry side will also colonize faster than wet grains and they are also much less succeptable to contamination.<br />Personally, I rinse first to remove the dust and chaff, then soak, then simmer, then dry and load jars.  Removing the dust and chaff before the soak makes the grains less likely to clump up later.<br />RR","title":"Re: Rye Grain Help"}}
