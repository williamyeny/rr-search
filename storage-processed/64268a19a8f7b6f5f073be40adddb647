Those pictures are actually Stamet's from an early edition of TMC, and they're not cubensis.  You have to be careful intrepreting a picture of one species/genus of mycelium and applying it to another.  One of those pics represents stroma.  It's the closest to what overlay actually looks like with cubensis.  A bit of rhizomorphic mycelium on the surface is ok. It's what produces primordia. Patch if you want to, but if you have primordia showing, don't.<br />RR"}}
