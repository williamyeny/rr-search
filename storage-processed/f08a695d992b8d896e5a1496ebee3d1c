I havent any other holes so no polyfill either. And these are expanded clay pellets which work quite well, I have 99RH (not100 as I said earlier thats a mistake)<br />do you think I should use perlite seeing that the humidity is fine, (and perlite dust is a bit toxic)?</blockquote><br />Don't sacrifice fresh air for humidity.&nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger, not humidity.&nbsp; Clay pellets are inferior to perlite.&nbsp; All dust is harmful to breathe, however wet perlite creates no dust.<br />Get more holes in the terrarium, don't filter them.&nbsp; You want continuous fresh turbulent air in your fruiting area.&nbsp; Mist to make up lot moisture on the surface of your casing layer.<br />RR"}}
