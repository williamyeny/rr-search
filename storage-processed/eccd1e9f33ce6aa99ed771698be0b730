Ultrasonics are complete overkill unless your mini-greenhouse is the size of a whole room.  For a martha sized greenhouse, you better have a cycle timer to make sure the ultrasonic runs only for very short cycles.  My greenhouse is the size of three marthas and I use two coomists located on the floor so they shoot upwards to maintain 98% to 99% humidity, but no ultrasonic.<br />RR"}}
