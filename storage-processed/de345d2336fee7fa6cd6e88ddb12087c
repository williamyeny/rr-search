It's always wispy and thin in the verm barrier on top.  Be sure to wash all of that off under the faucet after you birth. The verm barrier has any contaminants that were filtered out from the substrate laying there dormant, so that's the reason to wash it off under running water before you dunk and roll.<br />RR"}}
