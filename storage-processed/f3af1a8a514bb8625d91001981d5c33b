Fortunately, I tried a small scale grow with one of the cigars first, before destroying the whole $500 box of cubans.   The mycelium wouldn't touch the cigar.  I dropped half of a sterilized and hydrated cigar into a jar of colonized rye berries, and the mycelium wouldn't jump on to the cigar at all, so I cancelled that grow and just smoked the cubans, which was kind of weird too, since I don't smoke.<br />RR","title":"Re: shreeded cigar tobacco?"}}
