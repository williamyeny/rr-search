By the time the center of an oven bag of substrate has heated to pasteurization temperature, you've already killed off the beneficial organisms that will help prevent molds later.&nbsp; Pasteurize using water or steam as the heat-transfer mechanism.<br />In addition, if your grow room area isn't clean, you'll have to vastly increase air exchange and circulation.&nbsp; Stale, still air will stimulate mold and impeded mushroom mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: The hatred for coffee"}}
