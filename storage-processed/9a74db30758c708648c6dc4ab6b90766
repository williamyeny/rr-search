That's why experienced growers say a cube is a cube.  It's because they're all different.  None are noticably better than any other on a continuing basis.  All can be extremely good, or poor.  It's a roll of the dice with multispore inoculation.   That's why we isolate strains to single sectors.  Any 'strain' can be isolated down to a great fruiting strain with all the qualities one seeks, thus a cube IS a cube.<br />This belongs in the strain thread.<br />RR"}}
