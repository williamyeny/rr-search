For quite some time now, I've been including coir in my substrate mixes.  I believe it's better suited as a substrate than as a casing material. Most importantly however, the problem is the cost.  Compared to manure, compost, straw, etc., coir is very expensive.  Coir is not suited to be a casing material unless mixed(diluted) with verm, as was done in Blue's experiments.  In my opinion as well, peat is a better casing material, and it's what I've switched back to.  Another point is not to sterilize peat or coir in a pressure cooker.  Part of what helps initiate pinning is bacteria in the casing layer.  If you sterilize it, you lose this feature. Best to pasteurize only. One more point.  My research has shown that it is not only unnecessary, but counterproductive to 'incubate' the casing layer.  If you case when the substrate is 90% or so covered with mycelium, the myc is growing rapidly and will infiltrate the casing even if you expose to fruiting conditions immediately after applying the casing layer.  I've found that if I apply casing, then leave uncovered and exposed to light(which I do from day one, by the way) overlay is never a problem, but the myc colonizes enough of the lower casing to be able to transfer moisture into the substrate. This also leaves a bit of uncolonized casing material to provide all those little 'humid micro-environments' to stimulate pinning.  I actually get pissed off when the myc pokes through the casing, even a little bit.  <br />Very nice experiments. Thanks for sharing.","title":"Re: 50/50 Coco Coir versus 50/50 Peat Moss"}}
