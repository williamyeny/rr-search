The primordia really don't care if they're on a cake or cased substrate, so I always fail to see the reasoning behind the often repeated 'casings don't need a high RH', because they both will benefit from 99% humidity during the primordia formation stage.<br />Try to keep your humidity high as said above by laying a sheet of wax paper over the top of each tray.  This will keep the surface of the casing layer near 100% humidity, promoting pin development.  Don't forget to mist lightly a few times per day to keep the surface nice and moist.<br />RR"}}
