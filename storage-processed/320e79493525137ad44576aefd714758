Coir is not appropriate to use as a casing, because it will fully colonize, making it useless as a casing.  However, cubes will fruit from uncased substrate, so you'll still get results.  Just lay a sheet of clean wax paper over the top of that substrate to hold a high humidity level right where the exposed mycelium is and pins will form.  Wrinkle up the wax paper, then flatten it out slightly before laying on the top so air will have an easier time getting under.  Several times per day, lift the wax paper up and down a few times to evacuate any CO2 that has built up.  Change the sheet out for fresh wax paper every second day.  Stop misting until the pins grow enough to be considered 'small mushrooms'.  The wax paper can be left on during the entire fruiting cycle as the fruits will push it out of the way as they grow.<br />RR","title":"Re: First casing....close to pinning or close to overlay?"}}
