The above actually represents five expansions.<br />When we say to make a maximum of three grain to grain transfers, it's to make sure the mycelium is still aggressive enough to colonize the bulk substrate and then fruit.<br />RR","title":"Re: My mycelium culture has done over 3 expansions........"}}
