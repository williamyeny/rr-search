It's so we can allow the mushroom mycelium unfettered access to its food source.  It has nothing to do with contaminants that can kill us, which is a myth anyway.  If you're going to spread such, perhaps you can find one, just ONE person who has ever died from eating otherwise healthy fruits from a substrate with mold.  It won't happen.  In fact, trichoderma is a beneficial organism in the soil, and farmers specifically implant it into the soil of root crops such as carrots and potatoes, which are in direct contact with the fungus.  Another common contaminant, penicillium mold is used as food.  Ever heard of blue cheese salad dressing?  Any idea what those blue chunks are?<br />RR"}}
