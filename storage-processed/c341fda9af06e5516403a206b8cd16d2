I came back and it was almost 200 degrees! I immediately took it off the burner to cool off a little. <br /> </blockquote><br />Next time, reduce the heat when the temp reaches 130F, since it will continue to ramp up.&nbsp; For pasteurization of manure and straw, compost, etc., the closer you can keep the temp to 140F/60C the better.&nbsp; Try not to allow the temp to exceed 160F at any time, so you were already over temp when you first reduced heat.<br />It's going to be more likely to contaminate at this point, so if it were mine, I'd toss it out and consider this a trial run.<br />RR","title":"Re: what to do if temps. go above 180 when pasturizing?"}}
