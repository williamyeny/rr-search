If you want higher, you'll have to use perlite or an ultrasonic.   It sounds like you might have standing water in your perlite or else the humidity would have been 98% after sitting overnight.  Be sure to totally drain the perlite before you put it in the terrarium.  Any standing water at all will lower the humidity.<br />RR"}}
