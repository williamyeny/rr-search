You needed to mix your broken up cakes into the horse manure.  Mycelium takes forever to colonize down from the top.  If you just made it, I'd suggest mixing it all up, verm and all.  Then cover with foil and place on a shelf for a week or two to colonize the horse manure.  When it's fully colonized, you can fruit it as is by removing the foil and placing into fruiting conditions, or add a casing layer which is optional.<br />RR"}}
