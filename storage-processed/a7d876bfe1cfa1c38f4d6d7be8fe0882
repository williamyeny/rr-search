They don't give the brand name, unless I missed it somehow.  I have two microscopes that match the description they gave.  Below are two pictures of cubie spores taken with the same camera, but in different microscopes.  The shitty picture was taken with a $600 scope and the second pic was taken with a $2k scope.  You be the judge.  See if you can find out what brand/model the scope is.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/168945099-GT_old_microscope.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/168945099-thumb_GT_old_microscope.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/168951516-GT_cluster.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/168951516-thumb_GT_cluster.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Good microscope?"}}
