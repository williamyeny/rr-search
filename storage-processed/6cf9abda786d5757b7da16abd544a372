Is it mycelium?</blockquote><br />Yes, it's mold mycelium.&nbsp; I see at least some contamination in all but the dish labeled P, but the condensation might be blocking it.<br />You should <i>expect</i> contamination in petri dishes and it doesn't mean failure the way it does with grain or bulk substrates.&nbsp; Simply transfer healthy mycelium away from the contaminants until you have clean cultures.&nbsp; That's how it's supposed to work.&nbsp; You can take a horribly contaminated print or syringe and get healthy mycelium from it by using agar.<br />RR"}}
