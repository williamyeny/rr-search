As to the bleach, I was just talking about your garden variety bleach used for clothes. Was just thinking in the event of a contam issue, just shooting 10-20 cc of bleach into the injection port of the bad jar, shake, let sit for a few hours, then open/dump/clean. </blockquote><br />No.&nbsp; The bleach wouldn't penetrate all the cells.&nbsp; We dunk cakes for 24 hours to fully hydrate them, so a few hours isn't going to be effective.&nbsp; Besides, bleach is not that effective on mold anyway.&nbsp; I'd suggest taking the jars outside to dump them out, or simply tossing them in the trash if you don't want to boil them.<br />RR"}}
