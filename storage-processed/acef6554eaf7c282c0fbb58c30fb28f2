Do this several times to inoculate several dishes.  Allow them to grow for a day or two until they've expanded about 1/4\" from the transfered piece, and then grab another tiny piece of mycelium and again transfer to a new dish.  Don't wait for contaminants to show up.<br />Contaminants on agar are not failure.  That would have been a wasted jar if you hadn't used agar to clean up the culture.<br />RR"}}
