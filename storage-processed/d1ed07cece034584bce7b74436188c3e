The biggest cause I see of dry jars is lifting the weight or relief valve to let pressure out faster at the end.  That causes the grains that are at a temperature above the boiling point of water due to pressure, to suddenly loose all their moisture because the pressure that was holding the moisture in place disappears.  Let the PC cool naturally until you can handle it without gloves or a pot holder before opening.<br />RR"}}
