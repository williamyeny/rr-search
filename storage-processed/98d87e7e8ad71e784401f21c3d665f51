I have the perlite for humidity, but I want to be able to put in an air pump so I dont have to manually fan and air them out everyday. I was wondering what size air pump would be necessary for this. Thanks guys<br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/omgawesome.gif\" alt=\":omgawesome:\" title=\":omgawesome:\"/></blockquote><br />That's like asking what size engine a blue car needs.<br />Obviously, a larger terrarium will need more air.<br />I'd just build a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> and forget about pumps.&nbsp; Air pumps and fans are either insufficient, leading to poor pinning performance and contamination, or they're too much leading to rapid drying of the substrate.&nbsp; There's no substitute for your eyeballs and brain to know when it's time to mist and/or fan.<br />RR"}}
