Full colonization is defined as the mycelium using up all the available substrate and running into barriers such as the edge of the jar or tray, OR a contaminant.  If it's pinning prior to full colonization, it usually means there's a contaminant occupying the part of the substrate the mycelium didn't colonize.<br />RR"}}
