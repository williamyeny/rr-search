The purpose of perlite is to evaporate water to provide humidity.  That means that any perlite that is under water is wasted.  I can put four inches of well drained perlite in the bottom of a terrarium and leave the lid off and it will maintain 90% to 95% for two months.  Put the lid on and it will maintain 95% to 100% for twice that long.<br />Perlite is a crystalline mineral that doesn't absorb water, as you can see.  The only water perlite holds is what sticks to the surface.  Therefore, having it underwater is going to do zero good.<br />My terrariums have a dozen or more holes drilled into the bottom.  The natural air currents, since air is drawn from cold to warm, cause air to enter the bottom of the terrarium, work up through the perlite while being humidified along the way, then into the terrarium and back out the holes above the substrate.   This provides FAE without fanning, and 95% to 100% humidity.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/246577963-Perlite_1a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-008/246577963-thumb_Perlite_1a.jpg\"></a>"}}
