I have a few strains that get to the exact size for picking, and then they simply fall over, picking themselves.  This is a very desirable trait to me if I'm at work when the right time comes to pick.<br />Mushrooms do not have roots OR root like structures.  The mushroom fruiting body is mycelium, and it's genetically identical to the mycelium that is colonizing the substrate.  No comparison can be made to plants/roots when discussing mycology.  In fact, mycelium is a closer relative to humans and other mammals than it is to plants.  That's a scientific fact.<br />RR"}}
