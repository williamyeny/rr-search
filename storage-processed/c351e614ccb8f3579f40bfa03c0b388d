The rains were delayed, then it got very cold early.  Next year should be better.   I think you also might want to cut back on the watering.  Azures/cyans need to dry out quite a bit during the summer months.  Remember, they're native of the PNW where it is almost drought conditions from May to Sept when the rains finally come.  The drought, followed by the cold rain is the major pinning trigger for these species.<br />RR"}}
