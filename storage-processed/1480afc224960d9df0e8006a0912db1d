What he has above is a bulk substate.  When it colonizes 100%, it's time to add the casing.  <br />Your confusion is from people refering to their project as a 'casing' which is an abuse of terminology.  One should never refer to dunking a casing for example.  That would somehow involve dunking the casing layer while not dunking the substrate below.  If you crumbled pf cakes, those are your substrate, and you birthed them at full colonization and crumbled into a tray.  His substrate is coir, so when it's fully colonized, he'll put the casing layer on.  When the mycelium is breaking through the surface, it's time to initiate pinning.  Some growers 'patch' the first spots that break through so the casing layer colonizes a bit more evenly, but that procedure is optional.<br />RR","title":"Re: Time to Case?"}}
