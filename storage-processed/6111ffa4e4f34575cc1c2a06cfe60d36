They're usually labled 'natural daylight' on the package, as opposed to 'cool white' which are 5,000K and 'warm white' or 'kitchen and bath' which are 3000K, which is referred to as 'red' light, even though they still look white to our eyes.<br />You can also simply place the terrarium in a room with a bright window and let the natural sunlight do the job.<br />RR","title":"Re: Blue light"}}
