I'd imagine the gasses build up in no time in something that small.  You need three to five air exchanges per HOUR, not two per day. That's why I recommend drilling holes into all six sides of the terrarium. If you mist, and then close that thing up with the fruits wet, it's just one more example of the proof that doing so causes aborts.<br />RR"}}
