They turn towards light because they're <i>deriving energy</i> from the light.<br />If anyone is satisfied with poor, mediocre results, use low light or the wrong color temperature.&nbsp; If someone wants wall to wall flushes with lots of finish weight, use light in the correct spectrum, which is easily obtainable by 6500 Kelvin CFLs, and yes, they're cheap.<br />To the OP, 18,000K is too high a frequency for good results. Use lights of 6500K for best results, or another option is the new 'full spectrum' CFLs.<br />To CrayolaHalls, you can't compare the agaricus species which can grow just fine in total darkness, to cubensis, which requires bright light to develop meaty caps and produce the most amount of product.&nbsp; In addition, you sent me a PM, but I can't respond because you've disabled receiving PMs.<br />RR"}}
