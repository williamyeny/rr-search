You don't need or want more than that. If the mix comes out muddy, it means you added too much water.&nbsp; Squeeze it out and try again.&nbsp; Other additives such as coffee, coir and straw are fine, but not mandatory.&nbsp; Dump the contents of your morning coffee filter into the mix for an added boost.&nbsp; Make sure any coffee grinds you use have been previously used to brew coffee, so they're already leached.<br />Use gypsum at up to ten percent, so your mix of 5% is fine.<br />NEVER pH balance substrates, so don't use lime.&nbsp; If it's a bit on the acidic side, that's great.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium prefers a pH in the 5 to 6.5 range, which is what most bagged up cow manure is right out of the bag.<br />RR"}}
