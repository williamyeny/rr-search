The condensation will always form on the warm side when there's a temperature differential.<br />You will never see condensation on the walls of a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; The airflow prevents a temperature differential, so even at 100% humidity, a shotgun terrarium will have no condensation.<br />I live in a high elevation, very dry climate.&nbsp; My shotgun terrariums are always in the mid to upper 90% range.&nbsp; It's also important to remember that when it comes to growing mushrooms, fresh air and light are more important than high humidity.&nbsp; In addition, nearly all complaints we see here regarding low humidity turn out to be faulty hygrometers.<br />RR"}}
