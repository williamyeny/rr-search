I always felt like I had to take the old one back when I made the exchange.<br />I'll tell ya what though, when I was drilling the humidifiers and running tubing, I was going through motors just like you are.  Sometimes it would be the bearings that would go out, making it noisy, then the motor would burn out next from the extra load.  I figured the backpressure was forcing mist up into the motor.  Since I moved the humidifiers inside the greenhouse itself and use them just like they come out of the box, I've been on the same ones for over a year now, a record.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions on Coolmist construction"}}
