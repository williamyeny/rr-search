You still need twice as much sawdust by volume as wood chips.  In other words, for a five gallon bucket of chips, you want to mix it with two five gallon buckets of hardwood sawdust.<br /><b>Sawdust Supply</b> in Seattle sells large bags of Alder sawdust for $5. They weigh about 40 lbs or so. I don't know what shipping would be or if they even ship, but if anyone wants to give them a call, their number is 206 622 4321.  They have the very large grain alder sawdust that comes from the large sawmills, and it works great for wood lovers.  Get a bag of wheat bran from your local health food store and mix it in at 10% the amount of the sawdust.<br />RR","title":"Re: What are the suitable wood types for azures?"}}
