One, your hygrometer is not going to read correctly hanging on the side where the holes are.&nbsp; It's getting air from the room mixed in, thus the lower readings.&nbsp; Put the hygrometer down where your thermometer is and you'll see what I mean.<br />Two, fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, not saturation humidity.&nbsp; Untape the holes to get maximum fresh air.&nbsp; Mist as required to replace the moisture that is lost to evaporation.<br />If they're still stubborn, take the terrarium outside for a few minutes on a bright, sunny day and let the cakes be exposed to direct sunlight.&nbsp; That's a major pinning trigger sometimes.<br />RR"}}
