The site you and RR linked to doesn't seem to say which one to use.</blockquote><br />The viscosity of a fluid such as water changes slightly with temperature.&nbsp; Use the 60F figure since it's closer to the normal room temperature you'll be working with.&nbsp; Static pressure is measured in inches of water column or the metric equivalent. <br />Imagine taking a piece of tubing and bending it into a U shape an filling the bottom of the U with water.&nbsp; The water would equalize in the bottom and extend the same distance up each side of the U.&nbsp; If you connected a hose from the plenum of your flowhood to one side of the tube and it pushed the water down 1\" while raising it 1\" on the other end of the tube, that would be 1\" WC static pressure.<br />Scroll down to the bottom of the attached document and there's a description of manometer operation.<br />RR","title":"Re: HEPA filter question"}}
