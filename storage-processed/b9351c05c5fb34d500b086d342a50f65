When you place it in fruiting conditions is when you begin misting.  During incubation, you'll keep it covered with foil to restrict gas exchange a bit and block off light.  If it's dry, upon spreading over the substrate, spritz it down a bit if needed.<br />Coir/verm should be 40/60, not the other way around.  You want to use more verm than coir.
