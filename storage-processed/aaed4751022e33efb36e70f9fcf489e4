Take the caps and rub a little blue cheese or ranch salad dressing into the gills. Rub olive oil on the outside of the cap.  Add salt and pepper to taste, then grill outside on the bbq until done(gill side up), usually only a few minutes.  when the dressing in the gills starts to boil, it's done.  It's hard to beat cubes for good taste when cooked.  When raw, they're nasty as hell, just like any raw mushroom.  <br />The heat will degrade them slightly, but not much.  Cook up about 50 grams of fresh caps and you'll be happy.<br />RR"}}
