The distinct orange seems to be something in the substrate, not a contaminant.  Remember, molds are also mycelium and won't have distinct edges at first.  Lipstick mold also needs more than two days from spawning to sporulation which is what gives the red color.<br />Nice, clear, and in focus picture by the way.
