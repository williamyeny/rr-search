They're not rare.  The problem is they're usually stable sweepings and often have cedar chips mixed in to control odor, which prevents much mycelium growth.  In addition, they're usually fresh manure, not aged.  What you want to grow on is field aged.  A truckload delivered to your back yard might be good after you spread it out to dry and leach in the sun and rain, but I doubt dumping some spawn into a large pile at a horse ranch is going to do much.  They constantly dump fresh manure with a front end loader on top of the earlier pile, burying any spawn you put deep into the pile.  Not to burst your bubble, but I doubt it would work unless it's an abandoned ranch and the pile is aged, in which case it's probably already got pan subbs growing/colonizing it.<br />RR"}}
