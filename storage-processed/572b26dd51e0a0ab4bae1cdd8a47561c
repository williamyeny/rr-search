Take a look at the picture in this thread <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/5999103#Post5999103\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/5999103#Post5999103</a>  The contamination started at the top of the jar and worked its way down.  You can see healthy mushroom mycelium growth at the inoculation points, but it's being overtaken by the contamination that started from above.  That's an example of improper jar technique, most likely a damp/wet vermiculite barrier.<br />If your contamination starts at the inoculation points, check your syringe making or inoculation procedure.<br />If your contamination starts at random places in the jar away from both the top verm barrier AND inoculation points, it's in the sterilization procedure, which I doubt.<br />RR"}}
