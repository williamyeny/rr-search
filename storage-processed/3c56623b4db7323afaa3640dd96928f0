It was just squishy in my fingers. I tried adding dry material and that just got it too dry. Then right back to squishy. </blockquote><br />When the substrate is too dry, the cure is to add water, not more dry substrate.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />It has been incubating for 12 days</blockquote><br />Incubating is for premature babies and chicken eggs.  Substrates should be colonized at room temperature.  High temps only stimulate molds and slow down mushroom mycelium.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />You can use unpasteurized manure for spawning as well.</blockquote><br />That's news to me unless you're growing outdoors or use a very high rate of spawn.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />yes they were pasteurized at 150F for an hour or so, then put in the freezer for later</blockquote><br />Unless you have a separate lab refrigerator, that's a big mistake.  Kitchen refrigerators are loaded with mold spores from the cheese and other vegetables within.<br />RR","title":"Re: trays not colonizing"}}
