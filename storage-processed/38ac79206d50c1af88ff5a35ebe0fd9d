That's one of the reasons I think the whole LC craze is silly, and I've long advised against them.  Lots of growers waste valuable time growing molds instead of mushroom mycelium, and don't even know it for months, thus all their work is ruined.<br />If you haven't learned agar skills yet, I'd suggest injecting spores into grains, where you'll see molds within days if they're present.  If your jar fully colonizes mold free, you can use one jar to inoculate ten to twenty more, thus expanding your mycelium much farther and faster than an LC made from a spore syringe ever could.<br />RR"}}
