You want 100 to 150 linear feet per minute leaving your laminar flow hood.  A 12 X 24 filter has two square feet of surface area.  For that size filter, you'll need a 200 to 300 cubic feet per minute(cfm) blower, and make sure it's rated to deliver that 200-300 cfm at 1\" of static pressure.  They're available in the US from Grainger Supply for about $100.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-23/838197699-flow_hood_003a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-23/838197699-thumb_flow_hood_003a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Poor Mans Flow Hood"}}
