People don't live here.  I can't imagine a reason you'd be buying a heater in Dallas. I live in a much cooler climate and incubate on an open shelf at normal room temperature.  What exactly are you looking at a heater to do?  Also, please boycott wal mart.  Nearly everything they sell is shit and they are bringing down our standard of living.  Quit going there before it's the only place to go.<br />RR"}}
