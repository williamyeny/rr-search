Steam sterilizing can work well, but inconsistencies with temperature may lead to failure, which may explain why one of your jars cracked.</blockquote><br />???<br />How can non-pressurized steam have inconsistencies with temperature?&nbsp; It will be 212/100C no matter what at sea level.<br />The OP is obviously following an outdated and inaccurate technique.&nbsp; Check out the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek videos</a> and follow them without deviation.&nbsp; Everything is explained to make it as simple to follow as flushing the toilet.<br />RR","title":"Re: Exactly how to steam jars"}}
