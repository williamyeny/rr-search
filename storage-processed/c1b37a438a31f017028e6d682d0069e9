Don't use it unless Dactylium is trying to take over the casing layer, which you haven't applied yet.  If you're trying to colonize a manure substrate, that box should be sealed up, not open like it is.  You want to keep light off and keep the CO2 levels high during substrate colonization.  From the looks of that tray, I'd have used two or three quarts of rye, rather than one pint.  You shouldn't go over a one to four ratio of spawn to manure.  One to three is better.<br />RR"}}
