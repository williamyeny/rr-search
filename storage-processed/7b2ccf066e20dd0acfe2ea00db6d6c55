That is a major cause of contamination.  However, my experience is that when a tray contaminates with mold prior to first flush, it's because the spawn itself was contaminated, not the casing layer.  <br />That fact that your jars took ten weeks to colonize instead of two to three weeks, bears this out.  You need to find a cleaner source for spores or follow sterile technique earlier in the process.  That's where things went south, not at the casing stage.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Coir/Verm Casing Issues"}}
