All of my jars are currently sitting directly in front of the window and it gets sun most of the day.</blockquote><br />Monotubs yes, but colonizing jars should not be exposed to very bright light as it will slow down colonization and could induce early pinning in the jars.&nbsp; For colonizing jars, regular ambient room light on a day/night schedule is much better than darkness, but avoid very bright light.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>hihihi1717 said:</strong><br />Will standard fluorescent tube lights be too much, not enough or just right for fruiting? My room is in a windowless room, so the lights are kind of bright to make the room brighter.</blockquote><br />We recommend fluorescent lamps in the 5000K to 6500K color temperature range.&nbsp; Cool white tubes normally found in stores are around 5000K while 'daylight' lamps will run at 6500K.<br />RR"}}
