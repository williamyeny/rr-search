That is more than most major commercial mushroom farms are capable of making at once. If you've never used coir, I'd suggest starting out a tad smaller.<br />Secondly, I'm no fan of using coir for a casing.  It has so many nutes that the mycelium tends to fully colonize it, leading to overlay.  I've often said that a coir casing layer is actually a second substrate layer, and in fact I've spawned to plain coir and used it as a bulk substrate.  It's at least as good as cow manure when used that way.   <br />I'd recommend peat/verm.  Add calcium carbonate or hydrated lime at the rate of 5% of the peat by volume, disregarding the verm in that calculation. Add gypsum at the rate of 5% by volume to the whole mix and do include the verm in that calculation.  Moisten to field capacity and pasteurize for an hour or two at 150F. Do not sterilize.<br />RR"}}
