The more perlite exposed to the air, the more moisture can evaporate from it.  In addition, the trays tend to pack the perlite down, reducing its effectiveness.  You want the perlite nice and fluffy, so rake your fingers through it to fluff it up, and have your trays elevated above it for best results.  Especially at the pinning stage, you want humidity as high as possible.<br />RR"}}
