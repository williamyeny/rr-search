It is not.  By the time the core of a mycelial network has reached 86F, it's well slowed down over the maximum rate of growth, which occurs between 75F and 81F.<br />When people read the incorrect temperature, they do silly things like build incubators, when <i>normal room temperature</i> will work just fine with far less chance of contamination.  If you have a room that is 75F, use it and allow jars to colonize on an open shelf for best results.<br />RR"}}
