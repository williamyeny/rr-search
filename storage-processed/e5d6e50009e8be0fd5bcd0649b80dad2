Just a rubbermaid container with a couple of holes cut for your arms will work fine. There's no need to seal it up by using putty, etc. <br />Don't attempt to make it a positive pressure box as shown above.  Almost all of us made one of those when we were brand new at the hobby, but I don't know of any experienced hands who still use one.  They simply don't work because of the turbulence created which is the opposite of what you want with a glovebox.  The turbulence is guaranteed to swirl contaminants into your work, especially when you begin to work with agar, or doing grain to grain transfers.<br />A laminar flow hood is best of course.  You can buy one from Stamets' for $500 or make one yourself for two thirds that price.  <br />Here's the glovebox I use for isolating wild strains I bring home from the old growth forest that are always resplendant with bacteria and molds.  You don't want anything that is possibly contaminated in front of a flowhood or any other source of moving air because it will blow the contaminant spores everywhere.  Once I get the cultures cleaned up using the glovebox, future work is always done in front of a laminar flow hood.  The tyvek wrist sleeves are attached to PVC fittings with threaded caps, which enables me to keep it closed when not in use.  The tyvek sleeves enable me to pull my arm out so the alcohol flame can be on the outside of the box, rather than inside.  Use latex gloves with this setup. There's no need to tape the lid down when using the glovebox.  Just be sure to shut off any fans or AC units that may be on in the room you're working in.  Good luck.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879880-glove_box_006.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879880-thumb_glove_box_006.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879888-glove_box_007.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879888-thumb_glove_box_007.jpg\"></a>"}}
