Simply wash with soap and water before use.  You did not define 'box' so we have no idea whether you're talking about a glove box or fruiting chamber.  Either way, sterility is not necessary for either one.  The only purpose of a glovebox is to prevent drafts while you work.  Gloveboxes need not be sterile, and I never use lysol, etc., in mine.  Fruiting chambers also need not be sterile.<br />RR"}}
