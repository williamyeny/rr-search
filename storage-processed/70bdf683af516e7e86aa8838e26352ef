It will fully colonize.  It's ok though as cubes will fruit without a casing layer, but not quite as well.  I would recommend 50/50 peat/verm for your next project.  Peat is also a fraction of the cost of coir, so you'll get a better product at a reduced price.  When/if you switch to peat, be sure to only case the top.  We don't case the bottom of a bulk substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: Correcting overcolonization of casing"}}
