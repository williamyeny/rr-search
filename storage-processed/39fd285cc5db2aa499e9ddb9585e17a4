I forgot to shake the jars that came from the PC with to much water on the bottom, so I did it after inoculation which spread the water so nothing was dripping. Mistake? I still don't see any growth, how should i proceed? Just wait? ty</blockquote><br />If there was water in the bottom of the jar after sterilizing, it won't absorb back into the grains by shaking. I'm sure it will still drain back down, causing the bottom not to colonize.<br />Shaking after inoculating with spores slows down the progress.&nbsp; Next time, shake after about ten to twenty percent colonization.<br />RR"}}
