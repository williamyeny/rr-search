The static pressure is actually the pressure that builds in the plenum behind the filter.  The resistance of the filter causes the motor/blower to push against it, causing static pressure.   The static pressure then pushes equally against the entire surface of the filter, so that the air flows evenly through it.<br />You don't have to calculate for exactly 100 feet per minute.  Any value of 100 to 150 feet per minute will be fine.  If in doubt, get the next larger size motor/blower combination.  You can always block off part of the intake to slow down the air if you have too much flow, or you can get a speed controller to slow down the motor itself.<br />If you don't have a manometer, you can check your output with a cigarette lighter or candle.  The flame should bend over 45 to 90 degrees, but not blow out.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's the \"Initial Resistance\" and \"Final Resistance\" about laminar flowhoods?"}}
