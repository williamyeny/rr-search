With my AA, I can shoot an infrared thermometer at the black blow-out plug and get a reading of the temperature inside the PC.  Without venting, when 15 psi is reached, the blowout plug reads 205F, below the boiling point of water.  If the PC is vented for 5 minutes, when 15 PSI is reached, the blow-out plug reads 245F.<br />Fifteen minutes later, the unvented PC blow-out plug temperature has increased to 225F, while the vented PC blow-out plug still reads 245F. After 45 minutes, the temperature is the same, whether the PC was vented first or not.  If you fail to vent your PC before closing the toggle valve or placing the weight on, you should add at least 1/2 hour to the cooking time to make sure your grains are at the proper temperature for the desired time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Basic PC physics question"}}
