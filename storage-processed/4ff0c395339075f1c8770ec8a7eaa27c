Just don't push it by trying to case the grains too early.  Let them sit after they appear fully colonized for a few days.  Break them up and apply 1/4\" or so of casing, and then cover with foil for a week.  After that, which is going to be around march 1, expose to fruiting conditions and expect to harvest a week or two later.<br />RR"}}
