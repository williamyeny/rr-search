Hopefully, it will pin soon.  Next time, don't use lime from any dolomite source.  Dolomitic lime is too high in Mg.  Use calcium carbonate or hydrated lime.  Normally dolomitic lime takes a long time to break down anyway, so you should get a flush.  <br />What you need to do now is keep the humidity high, and fan as often as you think of it.  Massive amounts of air exchange and exposure to light is what you want.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
