We dunk in the refrigerator because in a wet and warm environment bacterial colonies will double in size every couple of hours.  This could be fatal to a casing during a 24 hour dunk in warm conditions.  The refrigerator helps to keep the bacteria dormant while the casing or cake is absorbing moisture.  It is not cold shocking.<br />Here's how I do it.  First, wash the entire casing under the faucet to remove the old casing material and any contaminant spores that may have landed during the previous flush.  Next, place the casing in a tub of plain tap water.  One tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water is optional, but commonly used and the mycelium can easily withstand that level of bleach.  Put something on the casing so when the lid is placed on the container, the casing will be pressed completely under water.  In this picture, four shot glasses were put over the casing, then the lid was put on the box, and the entire thing was placed into the refrigerator for 24 hours.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/186801881-Bra_003a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/186801881-thumb_Bra_003a.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/186805054-Bra_006a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/186805054-thumb_Bra_006a.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/186815608-Bra_007a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/186815608-thumb_Bra_007a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Case dunking?"}}
