Cubes thrive in 100%.  If it smelled bad, it could easily be cobweb mold, which makes a fuzzy mycelium on the caps if it's allowed to spread that far.  If it's just a few spots of very white mycelium, it's probably from the species you're growing, since mushrooms are mycelium.<br />I'll move this to contamination forum.
