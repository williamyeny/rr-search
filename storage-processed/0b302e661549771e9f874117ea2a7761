By wrinkling, you open up lots of little air passageways while still keeping the humidity tent.  it also helps cut down on the surface area of the caps touching the wax paper as they push it out of the way.  <br />Be sure to lift it up a couple of times a day to let all the built up CO2 from around the substrate escape.<br />RR"}}
