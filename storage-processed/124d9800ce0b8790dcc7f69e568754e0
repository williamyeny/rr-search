The Earth orbits the sun</blockquote><br />Yes, lots of us around here have taken physics, so we know that humid air is LESS dense than dry air.&nbsp; That's why clouds usually float above us.&nbsp; The heaviest air is when a cold wind brings an arctic cold front.&nbsp; They're usually right on the surface, and if you go up a few hundred feet, it can be ten to fifteen degrees warmer.<br />Dense air pushes on less dense air.&nbsp; This is how an airplane wing works.&nbsp; The air passing over the curved surface on the top of the wing has farther to travel, thus the molecules spread out and the air becomes less dense.&nbsp; The air flowing under the relatively flat surface of the bottom of the wing has less distance to travel, thus the molecules are closer together.&nbsp; This results in lift, with the bottom of the wing supporting the entire weight of the aircraft, provided it keeps its speed up.<br />RR"}}
