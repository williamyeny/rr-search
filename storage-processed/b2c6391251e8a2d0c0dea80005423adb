As said, we use the refrigerator to control bacteria while the cake is underwater and unable to fend for itself in the anaerobic environment.<br />Cold shocking is for certain edible species and involves dropping the temperature for up to two weeks to initiate pinning.  Cubensis fruits in Florida and Texas in the summer, so it hardly needs a cold shock.  If you don't plan to give your cakes or other substrate the 24 hour soak, simply move to fruiting conditions.  No temperature change is required.  I've actually fruited at a higher temp than the mycelium was incubated at, and everything worked fine.<br />RR","title":"Re: cold shocking amazonians?"}}
