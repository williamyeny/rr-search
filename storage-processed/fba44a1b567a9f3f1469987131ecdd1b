The wood is in there to be colonized by the mycelium.  If the culture dries out or otherwise 'dies' from being left too long, you can cut a section of the wood and place that on agar.  In most cases, the mycelium will recover from the wood and start growing again.<br />I have a complete section in my upcoming DVD already filmed on master slant preparation and use.  It won't be long now.  I'll have it released sometime this spring, I'm sure.<br />RR","title":"Re: how do you make slants?"}}
