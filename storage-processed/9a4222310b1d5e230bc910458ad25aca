It sounds like you cooked the first batch.  Always colonize agar at normal room temperature.  You'll need to transfer away from contaminants as soon as they're noticed.  Antibiotic agar will help with bacteria if you're attempting to clone outdoor wild mushrooms, but the antibiotics aren't needed when working with indoor clones or spores.<br />MotorCity, you want to wrap petri dishes with parafilm.  It breathes, yet has a pore size that prevents contaminant spores from entering.  Without parafilm, the slightest temperature variation will cause contaminants to be drawn into your dishes, where they might remain dormant until you spawn the agar to grains, at which time you'll wonder where all the green came from.   I would imagine micropore tape would work also.  Some growers use Glad cling wrap.  I use Parafilm.<br />RR","title":"Re: First use of agar ?s"}}
