I also don't use an impulse sealer.  I also often colonize bulk substrates in poly tubing such as used for straw logs. I roll up a tyvek sleeve and place one in both ends before tying the bag shut around the tyvek, similar to what you're doing with polyfill.  If you'll use poly tubing, you can make much larger substrates using this technique.<br />RR"}}
