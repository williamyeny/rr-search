That 'rule' still stands but must be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; Most low resistance filters for clean rooms are around 11\" to 12\" thick.&nbsp; Since there's less resistance, a larger plenum helps to mitigate the unsuitability by giving more area for the air to pressurize, thus a more even pressure is applied to the plenum side of the filter.<br />A more suitable filter for flow hood use will have a higher resistance, and will generally be half or less as thick as a clean room filter, even though that seems counter-intuitive.<br />The reason is that a higher flow filter needs more thickness to trap the particulates.&nbsp; A lower flow filter with a higher resistance will make it possible to pressurize the plenum sufficiently to achieve laminar flow.&nbsp; In layman's terms, laminar flow simply means the air leaving the filter is flowing at the same speed regardless of where on the filter its measured.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flow hood design question."}}
