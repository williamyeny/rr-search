I've seen cubensis take over and force copes off their substrate.  I've seen cubes take over wood based substrates that were actively fruiting the cauliflower mushroom, pushing the cauliflower fungus off the substrate and the cubes then fruited on the wood.  They will also drive oyster mushrooms off a straw log.   This is what I meant by cube spores being a contaminant.  <br />RR","title":"Re: do contams feed off cube spores?"}}
