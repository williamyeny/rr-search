I would say a 75 to 100 ohm pot will give you what you're looking for, so that's good advice.  Cutting the voltage as suggested by creamcorn is also a viable option, so you have more than one way to go, or you could combine the two for even more control.<br />12 volts at 190ma (.19 amp) equals 2.28 watts, so you want at least a 3 watt rating on the pot you choose to avoid excessive heat buildup.  If you can find one at a reasonable price get it, and if the motor is still too fast at the lowest setting, you can always get a fixed resistor from radio shack to put in series with the pot.  If you get a 50 ohm fixed resistor, the new maximum current will be based on the 63 ohms of the motor plus the 50 ohm resistor for a total of 113 ohms.  This will limit current to 10.6 ma which means maximum power will be 1.3 watts, so you could lower the rating on your resistor and rheostat to 2 watts.  Confused yet?<br />RR"}}
