I have some that are six weeks old right now and still fine because they were placed right back into the plastic sleeve after pouring.  Be sure to use a filter on the bottle when you PC the agar so it doesn't draw in contaminants as it cools.  I use a whiskey bottle with a synthetic filter disk in the lid, but you could also use tyvek or polyfill.  Allow it to cool until it's just a bit thinner than honey before you pour so there will be very little condensation.  You'll know when it's ready to pour because you'll need no heat protections for your hands from the bottle.<br />RR"}}
