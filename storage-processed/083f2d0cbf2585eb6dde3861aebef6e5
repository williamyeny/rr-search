That just doesn't make any sense.<br />Your cakes are obviously dry after all this time.  My suggestion at this point is to soak them for 24 hours in water, then after the soak roll them in dry vermiculite so that the verm coats the entire surface of the cakes. You do this in a bowl, just like you'd coat a piece of chicken with flour before frying. Return to the fruiting chamber, and mist well every hour or two in order to hydrate the dry verm until it's nice and damp.<br />Rinse the cakes very well under the faucet both before and after the soak.<br />RR","title":"Re: Too late to add verm?"}}
