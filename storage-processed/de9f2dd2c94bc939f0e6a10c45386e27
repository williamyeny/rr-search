You might see something if you put the dish under a microscope, but it takes a few days after germination for them to thicken up enough to see with the naked eye.  2 tsp is pretty close to the right amount of agar agar to use with 500ml.  As long as it thickened up it's fine.  Sometimes I use half the amount of agar so it's soupy for germinating spores, but it really isn't necessary if the spores were fresh or from a syringe.  I use wet agar when germinating right from the print, using an inoculating loop.<br />RR","title":"Re: agar too concentrated?"}}
