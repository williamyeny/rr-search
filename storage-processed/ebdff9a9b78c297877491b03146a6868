That causes the water to leave the agar from gravity and collect on the lid, leaving the agar itself to dry out, killing the mycelium. Even if there was moisture in the petri dish still, I doubt there was any in the agar itself.  Never place petri dishes in the refrigerator upside down.  I see that bad advice given again and again to people, and I have to stop and correct it every time, yet the myth continues.<br />That said, next time, inoculate test tubes for long term storage.  Place a piece of wood in each one, such as a medical tongue depressor.  The mycelium will colonize the wood, and remain viable for years, even if it dries out.<br />In my experience, the mycelium will begin to grow again within two or three days if it's still viable.<br />One last thing you might want to try is to take a piece of mycelium from the agar and drop it into a jar of sterilized distilled water.  Be sure to cover the jar with a filtered lid.  Sometimes, dry mycelium will recover in pure distilled water.  Don't add any nutrients to the water that might also feed molds or bacteria.  If the mycelium begins to grow that way, simply suck it up with a syringe and transfer to agar.<br />RR","title":"Re: It won't wake up?"}}
