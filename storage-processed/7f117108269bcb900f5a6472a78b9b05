Total sterilization would take at least 24 hours in the PC and your grains would come out as a sticky mush. The one to two hours we use for 'sterilization' gives us a <i>window of opportunity</i> to get the jars colonized before the contaminants that survived the pressure cooker can get a foothold.  <br />Don't wait three days.  Instead, if you're having contamination problems, simply cook up a few extra jars and always keep a blank or two at each step that you don't inoculate.  If you do a grain to grain transfer, keep one jar back that you don't use for g2g.  If you experience contaminants and your blanks are contaminant free, the problem was in your sterile technique.  If both the blank and the inoculated jar contaminate, the problem was in your sterilization process.  By using blanks at every step, you can always narrow down the problem to exactly the step you went haywire on.  Once you get your procedures down pat, you won't need to use blanks.<br />RR","title":"Re: To wait three days or to not..."}}
