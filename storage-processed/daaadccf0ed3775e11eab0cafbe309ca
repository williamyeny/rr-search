If there's still verm stuck to the cake, then it can do its job of absorbing water and supplying it slowly to the mycelium over time.  If the mycelium has fully colonized the first batch of verm you rolled in, then go ahead and roll after the second dunk.  The idea is to have some uncolonized vermiculite on the sides and top of the cake to absorb water and act as a reservoir for the mycelium.<br />24 to 36 hours if fine for dunking depending on how much moisture the cake needs to absorb.  If they're really lightweight, meaning they've dried out, then dunk longer.  If they feel heavy, then they don't need to dunk as long.  You don't have to worry about drowning them.  They could survive weeks under water if they're in the refrigerator.<br />RR","title":"Re: Dunking question..."}}
