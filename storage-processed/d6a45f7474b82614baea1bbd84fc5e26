It's great for grain to grain transfers.  However, if you're just starting out, I'd stick with rye berries.  Grass seed, because it's so small, takes a bit of time to work out your procedures to get moisture content right.  Rye berries are a bit easier.<br />If you want to use rye grass seed, for each quart(liter) mason jar, use 5/8 cup (150ml) grass seed, and 1 1/4 cup(300ml) water.  Add a pinch of gypsum between your thumb and forefinger to each jar.  It helps to mix the water and grass seed, then shake well in the jar and let sit for a few hours before sterilizing.  PC for an hour at 15 PSI.<br />Grass seed should just be used for grain to grain transfers or inoculating bulk substrates.  It does poorly by itself when cased.  Of course, it's good for sclerotia producing species as well.<br />RR","title":"Re: rye"}}
