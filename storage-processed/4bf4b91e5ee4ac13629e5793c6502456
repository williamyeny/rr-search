It's also common for contaminants to work their way through the inoculation holes in the lid.  When the mushroom mycelium reaches the contaminant spores, antibiotic and antifungal(against <i>other</i> fungi species) enzymes are produced to fight off the invading species.  These can be all colors of the rainbow, depending on the contaminant encountered.<br />The thing to do when birthing is to always wash the cake under the faucet, removing as much of the vermiculite barrier as will readily wash or rub off with your fingers.  This will remove any contaminants and the associated metabolites produced by the mycelium to protect itself.<br />RR"}}
