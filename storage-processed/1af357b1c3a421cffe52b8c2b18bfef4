I have never liked it. Its too fussy and dirty as hell. it is best to let it soak for a day or two, then boil/steep it for anywhere from 10-60 mins, drain it , fill jars, maybe wait another 24 hours and then pc it for 60-90 mins at 15psi. its so friggen acidic that the contams love it.</blockquote><br />That's pretty scary stuff there, and incorrect.<br />One should never soak rye over 24 hours, or the rate of contamination will explode.&nbsp; Rye grows on stalks of straw above the ground and is not dirty.&nbsp; It has grain dust and chaff on it which needs to be rinsed off, same as any grain or bird seed.&nbsp; Once jars are filled, they need to be sterilized immediately, not a day later, or bacteria bloom will have set in.&nbsp; Furthermore, rye is the exact pH favored by mushroom mycelium.<br />Contaminants are not caused by choice of grain.&nbsp; They're caused by failure to follow sterile procedure.<br />To the original poster, unless you shook the jars just before taking the picture, that isn't trichoderma.&nbsp; Trich won't pick out individual grains in a jar to colonize.&nbsp; If you're going to use grains, pick up a bunch of synthetic filter disks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Tell me this isn't a contam"}}
