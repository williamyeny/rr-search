The human body can not break down and digest raw mushrooms.  They must be cooked.  If you eat a raw mushroom, your stomach tries to digest it but can't, thus it triggers a 'non-food-item-in-the-stomach' reflex which makes you feel a need to puke.  That's a far cry from food poisoning, which really does make you sick.<br />RR"}}
