All during that time, my flowhood has been running to capture as many of the spores as possible. I won't grow again until I get my mushroom cave built, and it looks like I'll need to wear a respirator whenever I enter it. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif\" alt=\":frown:\" title=\":frown:\"/><br />RR"}}
