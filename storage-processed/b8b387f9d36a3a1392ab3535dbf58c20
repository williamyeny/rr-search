Personally, I don't allow the center to exceed 150F.  If you can get the substrate to 150F and keep it there for an hour, you're good to go.  That may require a bit of babysitting, and if the lowest setting on your 75x is still too hot, you'll need to unplug the unit for a while once it warms up.  As long as you stand nearby and tweak the settings during the process, it will work fine.  Be sure to hydrate the manure to field capacity before pasteurizing.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pastuerization HELP!"}}
