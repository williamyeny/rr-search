You want lots of fresh air, and then you mist to make up for the moisture that evaporates from your substrate.&nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content results in the best pinsets possible.&nbsp; The terrarium works on the principle that air flowing up through the cool perlite absorbs the moisture, bringing it into the air above.&nbsp; Tape up the holes and you defeat the purpose, lowering humidity.<br />The shotgun terrarium theory of operation is explained in <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/6880451#6880451\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">this thread</a>.&nbsp; It's similar to a system I helped put in during one of my first engineering jobs after school.&nbsp; The system in Alaska is still in operation to this day, keeping the ground around the pipeline frozen all year without using electricity.&nbsp; It works.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can I bury my tray in perlite in my shotgun?"}}
