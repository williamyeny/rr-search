It's not important however to adjust pH with coir when it's used as a substrate.  If you use coir as a casing mix, you need to adjust the pH into the 8 to 8.5 range.<br />Use 5% to 10% gypsum by volume.<br />Also note that I don't recommend using blood meal in substrates any more.  My experments showed it did absolutely no good unless it was added to a compost pile, and actually composted into the substrate material.  Kelp is good though.  Mushrooms love seaweed.<br />RR","title":"Re: How much PH buffer"}}
