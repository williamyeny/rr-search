What grows best on agar does not grow best on grains. Adding some of your expected fruiting substrate(in tea form?) to your agar will give you a better indicator of what isolates are going to do good on your fruiting substrate, IMO</blockquote><br />I've never seen one whit of evidence of this other than it was written in a book from nearly 30 years ago.<br />To the original poster, you need to get your grains drier before loading your jars.&nbsp; <br />In addition, you'll have better success with narrow mouth jars for grains.&nbsp; When you open them, there's half the area for contaminants to enter during grain to grain transfers, etc., thus you'll have half or less the chance of contamination.&nbsp; I know that wasn't the question, but just tossing it out there.<br />RR"}}
