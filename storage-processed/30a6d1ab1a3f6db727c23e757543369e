I won't even use lysol in mine. The heat alone from an alcohol lamp is bad enough.  In fact, I keep my alcohol lamp on the outside of the box and remove my hands to flame scalpels, inoculating loops, etc. If the blower had been on, you could have blown yourself into the next county from the extra air that would have fed the explosion. I also recommend against any sort of fan or filter in a glovebox.  So called positive pressure gloveboxes are not used by most experienced growers.  We all tried them when we were first starting out, but soon realized they cause more contamination from the turbulence they create than they help.  Still air gloveboxes are what the pros use when they're not using a laminar flow hood.<br />RR","title":"Re: FIRE IN THE GLOVEBOX!!! w/ pix"}}
