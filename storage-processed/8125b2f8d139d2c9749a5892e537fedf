First of all, the polyfill provides almost no filtering on a monotub.&nbsp; Remember, the top just sits there and has a huge unfiltered gap all the way around the edges.<br />CO2 does not sink to the bottom.&nbsp; CO2 mixes with the air which is also being heated by the colonizing substrate.&nbsp; The currents are thus in through the polyfill, and out(mostly) through the gap in the lid.&nbsp; The polyfill mostly serves to slow down the rate of air/gas exchange, thus keeping humidity and CO2 above ambient.<br />If CO2 settled to the lowest point we'd all be dead from power plant and auto, etc., emissions.&nbsp; Instead, CO2 can be measured at the top of the highest mountains.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why do we need to put polyfill in monos and let them consolidate?"}}
