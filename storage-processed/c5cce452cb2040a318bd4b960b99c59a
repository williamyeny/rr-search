Trich and especially cobweb thrive in humid, still, stale air.  Keep plenty of fresh air coming into your grow area, and have the air moving constantly if possible. If you're using a rubbermaid type container, an aquarium pump won't really give enough air exchange, so be sure to fan several times a day as well.  Drill a few holes in the sides of the terrarium.  Also, casings don't need over 80 to 85 percent humidity so no need to have it dripping wet.  That also leads to contamination.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: air pump causing contamination?"}}
