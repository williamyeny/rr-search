Since there's no way to get in behind the fan and magnatron to clean it, they circulate bacteria laden air that will contaminate your agar.<br />In addition, you're supposed to pour the agar after it's been sterilized(in a pressure cooker).  With glass dishes you sterilize them on a rack in a pressure cooker, while empty, and then you pour the sterilized agar into the sterilized dishes using a glovebox or laminar flow hood.<br />RR","title":"Re: Sterilizing petri dishes."}}
