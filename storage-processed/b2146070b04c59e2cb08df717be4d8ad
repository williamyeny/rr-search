First, don't install lights inside a terrarium.  Even a small light will create heat that causes other problems.  Second, if it's incandescent, it's the wrong color temperature.  You want a high frequency light such as natural daylight fluorescent for best results.  Simply hang it above the terrarium.  Bright, intense, high frequency light provides the best pinsets, so get a good one.  I use four, 4' natural daylight fluorescent tubes.<br />RR"}}
