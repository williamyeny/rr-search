Vaseline will protect them.  Best is to get an AA with metal to metal seal.  However, I suppose you should follow the manual.  Perhaps they have changed the material, but then again, perhaps they just want you to go through seals faster so they can sell you replacement parts.  Who knows?<br />RR"}}
