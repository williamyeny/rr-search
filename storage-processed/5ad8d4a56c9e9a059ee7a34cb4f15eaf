Your physical address information is on the order form you sent in the envelope with the money order, complete with fingerprints. I can't think of giving the cops a more incriminating way to tie you directly to the purchase.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; At least with a credit card, there's only a trail of 1s and 0s, thus you have a reasonable chance of plausible deniability.<br />If you're worried about leaving a trail, put a small amount of cash in a greeting card or letter with your order information.&nbsp; Keep your orders small to avoid losing very much money if it's stolen in the mail.<br />RR","title":"Re: where should I purchase my spores from?"}}
