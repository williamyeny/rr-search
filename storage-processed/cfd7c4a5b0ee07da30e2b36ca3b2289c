I was assuming you were using a tote type terrarium.  If you're trying to humidiy a mini-greenhouse with perlite, you're going to have a hard time.  It will help, but not enough.   Get a rubbermaid tote and build a simple terrarium.  what you have has too much cubic footage for the perlite to keep up with.  With perlite, you want the cakes sittig on a jar lid placed on the perlite.  Humidity is highest within 6\" of the surface of the damp perlite.<br />RR"}}
