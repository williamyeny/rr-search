These spores often times cover the casing layer and can inhibit further pinhead development. . . For these reasons, one should pick the mushrooms at the stage when the veil begins to tear or soon thereafter.\"</i><br />It would be wise to check ones facts before calling bullshit on people who have been growing mushrooms longer than most members here have been alive. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/nono.gif\" alt=\":nono:\" title=\":nono:\"/><br />RR"}}
