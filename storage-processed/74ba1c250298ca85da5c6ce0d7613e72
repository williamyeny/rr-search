Hydrate to field capacity first, then load the jars and cover with foil.  Lids aren't necessary.<br />I bring the water to a boil for about five minutes, and then shut off the stove and put the lid on the pot.  This seems to be about perfect for the kettle I use, my AA921.  The center of the substrate heats up to about 160F, and then over the next hour it cools down to 140F, which is the perfect time at the right temperature.   Anything you do to get your hydrated manure between 140F and 160F for an hour is great.<br />RR"}}
