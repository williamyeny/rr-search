Failing to spawn it to bulk is.  If you're going to crumble up a pf cake, use it as spawn to manure or coir.  As I've said, pf cakes are already 2/3 vermiculite.  Crumbling for no other reason than to add a casing layer provides little benefit over fruiting the cake after a dunk and roll.  If you doubt that, take a look at some of fahtsters posts.  His pf cakes will stand up against any crumbled and cased projects, and they fruit sooner because they don't require the recovery time after breaking them apart, nor do they require the time to partially colonize a casing layer.<br />However, crumbling the cake and using as spawn to a nutritious substrate will substantially increase harvest.  That was my point in earlier posts.<br />Rye is the same way.  It can be broken up and cased, but the yields will be much better if the rye grains are used to inoculate a bulk substrate.  Perhaps there would not be so much confusion if people would quit using the wrong terms.  I want to scream when I see posts where people talk about their 'casing' when in fact they've spawned a cake into coir or manure, but refer to it as a 'casing'.<br />A 'casing' is simply a non-nutritious top layer that is applied over a substrate in order to supply moisture and an environment that is conducive to primordia formation.  It should not be used as a synonym for a tray, substrate, or total project.<br />RR","title":"Re: Confused Casing Q"}}
