That means 12/12 bright fluorescent light or light from a bright window.  Massive amounts of air exchange. Constant air exchange is superior to only running a fan a few times per day.  You also want a slight 'turbulence' in the air at all times to ruin the day for molds, and you want high humidity.  The ideal conditions are constant fresh air, turbulent moving air, bright high frequency lighting such as 'natural daylight' fluorescent, and near 100% humidity.<br />There is no stroma or overlay in your picture.<br />RR"}}
