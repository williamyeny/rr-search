I didn't want to recommend recycling old newspapers and phonebooks, junk mail, etc., into mushrooms if there was the risk of heavy metals contamination from the inks.<br />The tray in my picture had holes burned through prior to first flush, a period of only a few weeks.  Aside from the aluminum contamination referenced/debunked above, the biggest problem could be the premature pinning caused by holes on the bottom of the tray.  Bottom line:  Find a different tray material for growing mushrooms.<br />RR"}}
