There is a rubber blowout plug, and a relief valve set to blow at 26 psi, giving two means of protection.&nbsp; If you modify a pressure cooker to a sterilizer, you BETTER monitor your stove setting to keep the correct pressure because you now only have one means of overpressure protection.<br />Anyone who thinks they're saving money by buying a made in china piece of shit for half the cost of an AA pressure cooker is only fooling themselves, nobody else.&nbsp; I know of no one with a made in china pc over five years old that still works. The seals leak, the regulators shit the bed, and the blowout plugs leak and fail. If you're going to buy a new one every two to five years, why not spend twice as much and get an All American that your great grandchildren will pass on to their great grandchildren?&nbsp; It's a bargain even in a retards books.<br />RR"}}
