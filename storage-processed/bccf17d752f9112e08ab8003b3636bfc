A PC works fine for this.  Fill with COLD water up to 3/4 of the way up the jars.  Put a weight on top of the jars to keep them from floating if that's a problem.  Turn on the heat and bring the water to a boil. Keep the pot covered. Allow the water to boil for five minutes, then shut off the stove and walk away for two hours, at which time you can open the pot and remove the jars.    If you do this in a large kettle, the inside of the jars of substrate/casing will reach 140F for an hour, while never exceeding 160F.  It's the easiest pasteurization tek I've used for small amounts.  For much larger amounts, look into the pillow case teks.<br />RR"}}
