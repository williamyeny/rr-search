You can't usually see contaminants in LC, so you waste however much time you spend watching those tiny flecks grow, and then you don't know if they're any good or not until you inject them into cakes and wait to see what happens.&nbsp; Thus, if they're good it's great.&nbsp; But, if they're bad, you've just wasted 30 days or more of growing time all to make a silly $10 syringe go farther.&nbsp; In my life and probably yours, 30 wasted days plus materials is worth far more than $10.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fermentation"}}
