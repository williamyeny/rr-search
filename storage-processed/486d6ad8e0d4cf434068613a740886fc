That is taking the decomposed material after the mushrooms have done their work, and use that as dirt or a fertilizer to growing plants. Do anyone know if this could work? Have anyone tried anything similar?</blockquote><br />It's been done for years.&nbsp; Last summer I did a project with the local weed control board where instead of spraying the roadsides, they enlisted boy scouts and church group kids to pull the weeds and then I donated the oyster mushroom spawn to turn it into food for their charity work.<br />Last year I also did a bank stabilization project on damaged soils using over 2000 spent shiitake blocks.&nbsp; The mushroom mycelium breaks down the plant material or sawdust, compost, etc., and makes it available for plants.&nbsp; If you go to the nursery, you'll find 'mushroom compost' which is spent substrate blocks from agaricus farms.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-42/068093271-Mushroom_substrates_for_soil_remediation_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/12-42/068093271-thumb_Mushroom_substrates_for_soil_remediation_a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-42/068093289-Chopping_oyster_mushroom_kits_for_soil_remediation_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/12-42/068093289-thumb_Chopping_oyster_mushroom_kits_for_soil_remediation_a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-42/068093308-Spreading_straw_over_oyster_mycelium_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/12-42/068093308-thumb_Spreading_straw_over_oyster_mycelium_a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Oyster mushrooms and fertilizer."}}
