I check on them to find very minimal sectoring (12 sections), and most of it appearing non-rizomorphic.</blockquote><br />Expect to make four to five transfers before you see much sectoring.&nbsp; You have so many strains growing on top of each other the mycelium looks cottony as a result.<br />RR","title":"Re: Strain Isolation... have I gone overboard?"}}
