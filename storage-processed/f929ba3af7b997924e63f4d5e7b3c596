It grows in the dead grasses and topsoil <i>below</i> the cow pies.  The cow manure, which gets leached by rain and dried by the sun, serves as 'shade' to keep the area in the grass/manure boundry area moist, which is where the cubensis mycelium actually grows.  After a rain, the cow pie gets wet and serves as nature's casing layer, so the fruits pop out of it.<br />RR"}}
