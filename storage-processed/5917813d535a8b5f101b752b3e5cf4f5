The substrate is only what supports the mycelium. The 'base of the mushroom' will remain alive in the substrate and continue to function if you don't rip it out as if the mushroom were a plant and the mycelium was roots, which they are not.&nbsp; Far too many new growers don't understand this basic fact and thus spread bad info.<br />RR","title":"Re: What I do with my ripped up monotub substrate."}}
