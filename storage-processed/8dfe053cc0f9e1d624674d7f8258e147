Or incubated at a temperature above 80F?  If so, it's likely just metabolic discharges/staining.  For best results, use your mycelium as soon as the jar is fully colonized.  Also, incubating at over 80F leads to excessive metabolyte production.  It's a stain and not a separate zone of growth, so it doesn't look like a contaminant.<br />RR","title":"Re: Whats this brown stuff?"}}
