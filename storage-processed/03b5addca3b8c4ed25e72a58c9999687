For pasteurizing, you'll be a lot better off with water. Besides, you need to soak the straw first anyway.&nbsp; May as well soak overnight and then turn on the heat all in one step.&nbsp; If ozzy is correct, you should be able to use that same unit to control the water heater element.<br />RR","title":"Re: Thermostat wiring for bulk steam pasteurizer advice needed"}}
