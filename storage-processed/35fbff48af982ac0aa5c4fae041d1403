If you could use manure tea for 'nutrients', we'd have all learned to grow mushrooms on rockwool cubes years ago.<br />Coir is the equal of horse manure for growing straw and dung loving mushrooms.&nbsp; If you want to 'boost' the coir, add shredded straw or even pull the weeds out of your garden and shred them to use in your substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Nutrient Additives to Coir?"}}
