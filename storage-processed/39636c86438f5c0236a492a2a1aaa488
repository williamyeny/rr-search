Jars are plain glass and nothing grows on glass.  It's important to say what's INside the jars.<br />In addition, it's best to follow established procedures for your first few grows.  Let those who have grown before show you how by reading the established and respected teks.  Once you have a few grows under your belt, experiment away because it's how we learn new things.<br />There is no need to let 'jars' sit after sterilization.  If you followed proper sterilization procedure, the contents of your jars are sterile(<i>right now</i>), so don't second guess your pressure cooker.  Inoculate as soon as they've cooled, or at least within 24 hours.  No sterilization is ever <i>complete</i>, but rather it only gives a window for the mushroom mycelium to get a foothold before the surviving contaminants do.  Waiting to inoculate decreases your odds of success.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
