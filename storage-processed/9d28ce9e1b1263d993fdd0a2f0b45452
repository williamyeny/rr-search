Potency varies wildly from grow to grow, from flush to flush, and from individual mushroom to the mushroom right next to it.  You might grow KSSS next time and it will be shit.  Ditto for any other strain including my favorites.  The bottom line I believe is genetic, but it's the luck of the draw with how the genes line up.  After all, ever notice how sometimes smart families have one kid who's dumber than a rock?<br />Potency also isn't as simple as choice of substrate.  If that were so, experienced growers would have long ago figured out a super substrate that will dramatically increase potency every single time.<br />Just wait a few weeks and eat some more from the same batch.  Chances are, you'll visit the moon.<br />RR"}}
