On a petri dish, mycelium will grow fastest at 86F, but that doesn't mean it's optimal because molds and bacteria also do very well at that temperature.<br />Mushroom mycelium is <i>tolerant</i> of lower temperatures, but molds and bacteria are <i>less tolerant</i>.   Also, colonizing mycelium produces its own heat.  I suggest no more than 80F for colonizing quart jars of grains, because this will give you very close to the 86F 'optimum' without encouraging molds and thermophilic bacteria.  Personally, I use 75F, and have no use for incubators and the breakdowns, fire hazzards, and stale air within them.  If it's cold in your room, run a small heater and heat the entire area.<br />RR","title":"Re: very confused"}}
