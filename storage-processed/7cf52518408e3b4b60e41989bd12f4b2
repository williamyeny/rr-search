Plant food won't do squat for mushrooms.&nbsp; Mushrooms don't 'uptake' as you suspect because they don't have a vascular system like plants. Food is digested at the cellular level.<br />Using plant food on grains probably won't ruin the batch, but it won't do any good either.&nbsp; Grains are already nearly too rich in nutrients, and this is the reason they must be sterilized.&nbsp; Grains are also the reason we consolidate a substrate.&nbsp; They're so rich that blobs and mutants generally develop if we fail to do so.&nbsp; Any plant food in the grains would have been long since metabolized by fruiting time. We also know that excess nutrients slows down colonization.<br />RR"}}
