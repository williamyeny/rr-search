The colonizing mycelium creates heat, which causes a temperature differential.  Reduce the temp differential and the problem will solve itself, but don't get the room too warm.  Doing so can cause a cascading effect inside the tub.  A little condensation isn't bad, but just don't let it flood and you'll be fine.<br />RR","title":"Re: Water dripping onto substrate..solutions?"}}
