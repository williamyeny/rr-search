Upper 70's is plenty warm.  Anything above 80 will lead to a higher contamination rate.  If your air temp is 85, the temp inside your jars will be a few degrees warmer, and growth rate falls off very rapidly above 86F.  I would recommend you consider 80 to be the maximum air temperature for use with grains.  Personally, I keep quart jars of rye grain on a bookshelf at normal, air conditioned room temperature and they colonize in 2 weeks or so.  The increased rate of contaminants above room temperature is not worth the extra day or two of faster colonization you will get.  Hope this helps.<br />RR","title":"Re: will 10psi be enough?"}}
