Use it at no more than 1 part chicken manure to 20 parts of the other substrate materials.  The reason I say that is coffee is pretty darned expensive to buy for a substrate.  If you drink coffee anyway, no problem, but otherwise there are other materials that work as well.  Coffee should be brewed before using.  You can brew up a pot of coffee, then use the liquid coffee to hydrate your rye or wbs, and save the spent grinds for your substrate.<br />RR"}}
