Imagine if you took a clear plastic hose and bent it into a U shape and filled it half way to the top with water.  If you hooked one end of the U to the plenum behind your filter, 1\" WC would cause the water on one side of the hose to be pushed down 1\", while the other side would go up 1\".   <br />The reason we want static pressure is to even out the flow on the front side where we are working.  By having pressure behind the filter, the flow out the front side is uniform, so there is no turbulence.<br />A 30 X 24 filter has 5 square feet of area.  You want between 100 and 150 lineal feet per minute leaving your filter, so 500 CFM would not be quite enough because there will be losses due to turns and friction, turbulence, etc., between the blower and the filter. <br />I'd suggest for that size filter a blower with a CFM rating of 750 to 1000 CFM at 1\" static pressure(WC).  You can always block off part of the intake if flow is too great.  You'll also have some losses due to the prefilter you'll want to use on the intake to the blower.<br />RR","title":"Re: Good prices on blowers for flowhood(need input though,might be too powerful"}}
