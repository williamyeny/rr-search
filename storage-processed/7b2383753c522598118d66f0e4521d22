That's a single speed, dual voltage 115/230 volt motor, so you'll need to get a picture of the data plate.  I don't want to venture a guess and have you burn it up.  It's also 1000+ cfm at .8\" static pressure so I hope you have a huge flowhood or you'll need a motor speed controller to slow it down. It's too big even for a 48\" X 48\" HEPA without a speed controller. <br />RR","title":"Re: Wiring a Large Dayton Fan"}}
