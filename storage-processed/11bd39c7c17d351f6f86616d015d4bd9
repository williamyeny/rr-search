That's impossible with the holes in your lids. I meant that if you put the rubber side down, it tends to stick to the glass like glue, and the lid is a pain to get off.<br />When they get really rusty, you can rub them with one of those green kitchen scouring pads and they buff right up.&nbsp; I've used some of my metal lids hundreds of cycles.&nbsp; I've become pretty anal about making things last in my old age. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />It sounds like they've improved plastic lids in the last few years.&nbsp; When I first tried them in the 90's, they would tend to get loose in the PC, so you'd tighten them when the jars came out to prevent contamination, but then they'd often crack when cool.&nbsp;  Later, the plastic lids I bought from fp in 2000 or so would sometimes pop off when I'd shake the grains, and you can imagine the mess that makes on the carpet.&nbsp; <br />Agar sent me a package of his lids a year or two ago, but I haven't gotten around to trying them yet.&nbsp; It's on the list for this winter.<br />RR","title":"Re: Invert Lids or Rubber side down?"}}
