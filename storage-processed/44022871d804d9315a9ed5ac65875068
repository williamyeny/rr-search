I use extra water in the PC when doing agar or LC so the pressure will drop more slowly due to the thermal mass of the extra water.  Sometimes it also helps to reduce the stove burner slowly over 20 minutes rather than simply shutting it off after time expires.   As said above never try to speed up the process by lifting the weight or doing anything else to cool off the PC.<br />The other thing that causes boil over is too high a stove setting during the PC cycle.  If the weight is rattling, LC is boiling over.  You need to reduce the heat to the minimum setting that will maintain the 15 psi as soon as pressure is reached.  Don't allow the weight to rattle.<br />RR","title":"Re: LCs boiling over"}}
