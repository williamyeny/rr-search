If you live in an area with acidic soil, lime is at every hardware and garden center.  If you can't find it, you can order hydrated garden lime at doitbest.com<br />Peat/verm makes an excellent casing material.   Coir is a great substrate, so you could spawn your grain or brf jars to the coir, then when the coir is fully colonized, case it with the peat/verm.<br />We don't lime the casing for the mushroom mycelium.  Nearly all fungi prefer a ph of around 6.  We use lime to get a ph of 8 to 8.5 because mushroom mycelium can <i>tolerate</i> that high ph, but mold spores such as trichoderma and cobweb have a hard time getting a foothold in a high ph environment.<br />Good luck Mrs and keep searching.  You'll find the answers you need.<br />RR"}}
