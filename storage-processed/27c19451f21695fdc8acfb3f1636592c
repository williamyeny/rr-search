Three 1/4\" holes is too much for a rye grain jar.  This isn't related so much to your moisture problem, but remember that a 1/4\" hole is four times as large as a 1/8\" hole.  I recommend using four 1/8\" holes for gas exchange.  If you use more than that, you run a risk of drying out your grains and/or stimulating pinning inside the jar due to having too much air exchange, as opposed to a small amount of gas exchange.<br />I'm sure the water entered by having way too much water in the PC.  Don't have the water 1/3 the way up the jars.  As the water boils, it will splash up and get under the foil, thus entering the jars.  If using quart or liter jars, the water doesn't need to be more than 1\" up the side of the jars.  In fact, 1 to 1-1/2 inches of water in the PC is plenty for even a two hour cycle, because you're supposed to turn your stove down once pressure is reached to the minimum setting that will still maintain 15psi in the PC.<br />RR"}}
