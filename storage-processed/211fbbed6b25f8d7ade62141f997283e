At fruiting, you want a much larger amount of air exchange.  It's not a contradiction, but rather different phases of the life cycle.  If you had lots of air exchange during colonization of a substrate, the mycelium would consume too much of the substrate.  We keep CO2 levels high for that reason, and then lower them with massive amounts of air exchange at full colonization, which brings in two major pinning triggers at the same time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Apparent contradiction?"}}
