Don't incubate over 80F, especially a large substrate.  Higher temps favor bacteria and thermophilic molds over the mushroom mycelium.<br />Get a mechanical hygrometer that can be calibrated.  99% of the digital ones are crap above 90% humidity.  Cigar shops are a good place to look.  I get mine for ten bucks and they stay within a point or two of being correct in between calibrations.  I calibrate them three or four times per year.<br />RR"}}
