Dunking is to hydrate the substrate below the casing.  24 hours works fine.  More isn't necessary.  It's best to dunk in the refrigerator because bacteria can grow in the water as the dunk is progressing and the cold temps hold the bacteria back.  If you don't have room in the fridge, you can put the substrate in a large tupperware or other container, weight it down with a heavy object to keep it underwater, then leave the faucet running slowly all night.  This will keep a constant flow of fresh water and also circulation which will keep any bacteria from growing.<br />RR","title":"Re: Whats the longest a casing can be dunked??"}}
