Peat should be pasteurized, never sterilized.  The beneficial bacteria that survive during pasteurization will help to prevent molds.  Also, peat has a ph of 4-6, so you need to be sure and use lime.  I use hydrated lime at 5% by volume of the amount of the peat.  In other words, for ten cups of peat, use 1/2 cup of hydrated lime.<br />Coco coir and peat are not similar.  Coir has lots of nutes and can be used as a substrate just as manure can. In fact, it works better than the cow manure you get bagged up at the nursery. Peat is nutrient free, thus it is more suitable as a casing material.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green Mold?"}}
