When you use desiccant, be sure to have the desiccant lifted off the floor of the tupperware or other container, so that moisture that drips from the fruits can run through the desiccant to the bottom of the container to collect.  This will prevent the premature saturation of your desiccant layer.  <br />If the fruits are for use within a few days or so, just leave them in front of a fan until then.  Dehydrators and desiccant are mainly for when you wish to package them up for later and need to make sure they're especially dry to prevent molding. <br />Congratulations on a successful harvest!<br />RR"}}
