We adjust moisture for our substrates by using 'field moisture level' which is achieved when you can pick up a handful of substrate or casing and no water flows out by gravity.  However if you squeeze gently, a few drops will come out, and if you squeeze very hard, a light stream will drip out.  After practicing a few times, you'll get perfect moisture content.<br />RR"}}
