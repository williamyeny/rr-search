The foil actually reflects and channels light deep into the substrate.<br />If it's already pinning, the best thing to do now is just to let them grow, and harvest when mature.  If there are still uncolonized portions of the bag at that time, it would be best to bury it outdoors with a bit of cow or horse manure in the shade.  You still might get another flush before winter.<br />RR","title":"Re: Simultaneous Colonizing & Pinning"}}
