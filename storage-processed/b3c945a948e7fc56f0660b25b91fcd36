Place the tray in the sink and fill it up with water.  Place a quart jar full of water on top of the bulk substrate to keep it submerged.  Leave the water running gently so it keeps the container full, with a small amount spilling over the sides and going down the drain.  Let the water run for 12 hours or so, then drain and put back in the fruiting chamber.  The running water will keep bacteria from getting a start. I've actually seen pins double in size during the dunk.<br />RR"}}
