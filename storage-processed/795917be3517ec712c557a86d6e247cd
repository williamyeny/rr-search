Perlite humidfication is considered optional with cased substrates, but I'd use it anyway for the extra humidity, then leave the lid crooked and drill a few holes in the side of the FC for constant air exchange.<br />To allow the perlite to have maximum surface area, elevate your tray on whatever you can find around the house.  A screen would work, or an unused dishwasher shelf, or you can bend some heavy wire to make a rack to elevate the tray above the perlite.<br />RR"}}
