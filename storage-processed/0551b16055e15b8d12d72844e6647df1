It should be pasteurized, which can't be done in a microwave.  Here's my pasteurization tek.<br />Put a meat thermometer into the center of one of your jars of substrate/casing. You don't need a lid on the jar if you don't want, foil works just as well. Stick the meat thermometer through the foil and into the center of the jar.<br />Place COLD water in the kettle or PC 2/3 of the way up the jars. Turn on the stove. Allow the water to boil JUST until the thermometer in the jar reads 140F/60C. Shut off the stove and start your timer for 1 hour. The jar will continue to heat to around 150F to 160F, then begin to decrease. If the temp drops to 140F prior to one hour, simply turn on the stove and bring it back up again. At the end of one hour, the jars can be removed, and in another couple of hours they'll be cool enough to use.<br />RR","title":"Re: casing sterilization"}}
