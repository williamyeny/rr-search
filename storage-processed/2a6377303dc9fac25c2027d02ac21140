BRF can be used to suppliment the sawdust if you don't have access to brans. Don't feel that you must have Alder because that's what they grow on in the Pacific Northwest.  Azures will grow on most hardwoods.  For jar culture, you'll want to use rye grains, then spawn those to your supplimented woodchips/sawdust/gypsum mix in spawn bags.  When colonized, bury into a bed of chips in your outdoor garden area after last frost.<br />RR"}}
