Two rows of jar rings will get the bottom of the jar out of the water.  If you don't have that, use a row of empty jars on the trivet, so the jars with substrate are elevated out of the water.  1/2 pint jars are not tall enough to avoid the splashing as the water boils if they're down in it.<br />RR"}}
