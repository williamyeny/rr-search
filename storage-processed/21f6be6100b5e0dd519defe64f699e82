You can't have too much humidity.<br />If you're running a small terrarium, you need to get rid of the humidifier and use perlite.  You'll get mid to high 90% humidity without all the water puking all over everything you'll get from an ultrasonic in a small area, where the volume of air can't possibly absorb all the water you're pumping into it.<br />RR"}}
