It's the loss of this food supply that is one of our pinning triggers.&nbsp; One can obtain a massive one flush wonder by using a low spawn rate, but with plenty of rice or oat bran in the substrate.&nbsp; The mycelium consumes the bran and loads up, but then by full colonization the bran is mostly used up and a massive flush results.<br />RR","title":"Re: Another reason I don't use monotub liners"}}
