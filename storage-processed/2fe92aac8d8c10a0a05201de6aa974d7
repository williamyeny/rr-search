If you make it totally sterile, it will very likely contaminate before or just after first flush.  You should pasteurize casing material, not sterilize it.<br />It's very easy to use your PC to pasteurize in quart jars.  Load your field capacity casing material or compost/manure into quart jars and place in the PC.  Fill with COLD water 2/3 to 3/4 of the way up the jars.  Cover and turn on the stove.  Do not place the weight on your pc.  Leave the vent open.  Allow the water to come to a boil where you can feel steam escaping from the vent hole.  Allow steam to escape for five minutes, but no longer.  Shut off the stove and leave the PC alone for two hours.  At that time, you can remove the jars and they'll be just right.   I've used this tek for years, and the interior of the jars will reach 150F for an hour, but never exceed 170F.<br />RR","title":"Re: sterilizing casing mix"}}
