Even if you have to break the substrate in half, it's what you need to do.<br />Foil on the bottom INcreases bottom pinning because it reflects light from above to down below.   Another common cause of bottom pinning is drillng drain holes in the tub, below the substrate.  The increased air down there incourages pinning.  A third major cause of bottom pinning is the incorrect procedure of using a casing layer on the bottom.<br />Since you refer to the whole project as a 'casing' I have no idea how it's put together.
