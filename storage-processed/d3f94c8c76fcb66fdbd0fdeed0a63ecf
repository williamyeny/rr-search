Not only that, they then tell others that Lysol and Oust cause mutants, and the myth spreads.&nbsp; <br />I fog my room with oust to the point it's hard to see through.&nbsp; I hold a can in each hand and spray for over a minute, completely fogging the room up.&nbsp; It doesn't cause mutants.&nbsp; I buy Lysol and Oust by the case.<br />RR","title":"Re: First time growing.
