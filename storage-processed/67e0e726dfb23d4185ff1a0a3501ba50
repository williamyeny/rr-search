The substrate would be spawned, and the casing laid on top.  It still works to do it that way.  What we've found however, is that pinsets and eventual yield can be increased by letting the substrate fully colonize in a high CO2 environment, and then let the casing layer colonize partially in a high CO2 environment, and then at the precise time, expose to fresh air, light, etc., all at once to trigger very nice flushes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Saving time by laying casing during spawn run...? Eh?"}}
