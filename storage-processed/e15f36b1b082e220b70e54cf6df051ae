You want lots of air exchange and near saturation humidity.  Bright high frequency light is also much more effective than room lighting.  Even with holes, you'll want to fan and mist.  Keep them moist, and with lots of fresh air and light, and they'll do fine.  If they're fuzzing up, you should see knots soon.  Don't fix what isn't broken.  You can always leave the lid cracked open a bit if you feel they need more air.<br />RR"}}
