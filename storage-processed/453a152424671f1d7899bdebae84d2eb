It works great for our uses and does not contain asbestos.  The mine in Libby was shut down.  You can get a better deal on a 3 cubic foot bag if you'll find an insulation supplier in your area.  I bought 9 cubic feet for $5, which is what the garden and hardware stores charge for the little bags.<br />RR"}}
