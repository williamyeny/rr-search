Yes, consider a 1 1/2\" substrate depth maximum for copes.  I really don't know why either, but every time I tried for a thicker substrate, they would colonize ok, but simply sit there and not fruit.  I usually go with a 1/4\" casing layer, but I see your 1/8\" is doing fine.  I've also had better pinsets by not pasteurizing the casing layer with this species.  Just mix it up and lay it on.<br />Something you're likely to notice also is these tend to fruit continuously, rather than in distinct flushes, but sometimes that depends on strain.  They also seem to look for excuses to abort, so be careful with misting.  Wax paper will help hold in the moisture, but make sure the fruits are dry before you lay it on top of them. Looking good!<br />RR","title":"Re: My First Pans Cyans"}}
