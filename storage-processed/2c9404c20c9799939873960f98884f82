Ditto for mushrooms.&nbsp; When we read that mycelium uses nitrogen in its metabolism just as nearly all life forms, it means that it needs to be digested from solid food.&nbsp; Mushrooms don't absorb usable nutrients from non-organic sources.&nbsp; They're just not wired that way.<br />This silly argument has been going on for years with noobs.&nbsp; Ten or so years ago I offered a free microscope to the first person who could grow a real hydroponic mushroom on inert materials fed with chemical 'ferts' only.&nbsp; A quick search will reveal all the threads that started with everyone going to prove me wrong and do it.&nbsp; Not a single person ever pulled it off, so this talk about 'ferts' is bunk not supported by science or experience.<br />RR","title":"Re: violets tek anyone?"}}
