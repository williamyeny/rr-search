It needs a casing layer, or to be mixed with verm or coir(coir or manure is preferred).<br />Rye should be prepared in quart jars for best results, and you only shake ONCE during colonization.  It's easy to break up the grains by banging them against a fully inflated tire.  Shake once at about 30% colonization, and then shake again to break up the grains at spawning time so you can pour them out of the jars.<br />RR"}}
