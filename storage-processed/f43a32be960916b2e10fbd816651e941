It doesn't have enough resistance to create a pressurized plenum behind the filter, thus no laminar flow.  When you get your hands and/or jars etc., into the flow, eddies and other turbulence will occur that will force contaminants into your work.  I'd suggest running it for a few hours before working to clean the air in the room, and then shut it down just before doing the sterile work.<br />RR"}}
