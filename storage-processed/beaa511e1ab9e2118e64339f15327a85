Anything over about 4 hours should be long enough to soften the grains enough to prevent the kernels from bursting.  Endospores are rarely a problem with rye, provided you soak at least the 4 hours mentioned above.  If the batch of grains you're using has an unusually large endospore count, you might need to soak longer.<br />RR"}}
