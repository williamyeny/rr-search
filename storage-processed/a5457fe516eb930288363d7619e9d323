To test for proper casing moisture content, pick up a handfull of casing material;  No water should drip out.  However, if you squeeze gently, a drop or two will seep out, and if you squeeze hard, a small stream will drip out.  That's what we call \"field capacity\" level.  You'll get a feel for it after a few times.<br />Pelletized limestone will take too long to break down to be of much use in a short lived casing layer.  Find some hydrated lime or calcium carbonate flour.  You need something that will go to work right away.  Did you remember to add gypsum to the casing mix?<br />RR","title":"Re: casing layer not colonizing"}}
