Don't use any toxic cleaners in your terrarium.  The time for sterility is when you're making up the jars.  There is zero tolerance for contaminants at that time.  Once the substrate is fully colonized, your mycelium will take care of itself, eating bacteria and mold spores for lunch, as long as it's healthy, and you give plenty of air exchange.  Most contaminants in a terrarium or even a mini-greenhouse can be traced to improper air exchange.<br />RR","title":"Re: PF Tek - Do I wait to see pinning to birth?"}}
