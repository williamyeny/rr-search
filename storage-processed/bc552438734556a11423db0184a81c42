Alcohol is a sanitizer, not a sterilizer, so the needle is cleaner before you touch it with the alcohol soaked cotton.<br />If you're getting soot on your needle, it's probably because you're using rubbing alcohol in your lamp.  You need to go to the hardware store and get denatured alcohol. It won't leave soot on your tools.  It will be in the paint section.   The first drop or two of spore solution will cool your needle just fine.<br />RR"}}
