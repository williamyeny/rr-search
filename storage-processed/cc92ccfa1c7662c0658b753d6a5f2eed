It will also be higher with cakes inserted than empty.&nbsp; You can speed up the humidity rise by misting.&nbsp; It also helps to 'rake' the perlite with your fingers so it's nice and loose, with a rough surface area, and not packed down.<br />Check your hygrometer by wrapping it up in a damp towel for an hour, and then checking that it reads 99%.&nbsp; Mechanical hygrometers should have an adjusting screw on the back, so you can tweak the needle to read 99%.<br />RR"}}
