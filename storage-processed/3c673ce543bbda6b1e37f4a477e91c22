Anastomosis is the pairing of dikaryotic mycelium with other dikaryotic mycelium.  In other words, combining strains, but not species.  For example, Penis Envy could combine with cambodian cubensis via anastomosis, but neither could combine with oyster, shiitake, or mold.<br />RR","title":"Re: Amazing Isolate EATS contams!!!"}}
