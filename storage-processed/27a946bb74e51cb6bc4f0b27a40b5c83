I use grains 99% of the time, but that doesn't mean BRF is inferior, and neither one causes the mushrooms to be more or less potent.  To claim otherwise is the same as claiming a certain food can turn pee-wee herman into arnold, or a retard into an Einstein.  Such is not supported by the facts.<br />RR"}}
