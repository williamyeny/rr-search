You'll end up needing to refrigerate/AC the room, which will cause condensation to build up on the outside of the plastic sheeting, which will then result in molds.  I suspect that humidifier will end up with a lot of water dripping on the floor too, so make sure there's a way for it to run to a drain.  <br />I would also worry about having a water hose connected.  If something were to break down in the humidifier, a water hose can supply enough water to do a lot of damage if it's in a house.<br />As said already, definitely do something about the electrical panel.<br />RR"}}
