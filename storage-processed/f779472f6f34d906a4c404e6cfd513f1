To get the larger pieces you need for fruiting, simply use your band or table saw to cut it into 1/2\" slices.  To fill the gaps between the larger pieces where the fruits will form, use course(NOT fine) sawdust.  I'd suggest supplimenting it with wheat or rice bran prior to sterilization. Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: kiln dried alder..."}}
