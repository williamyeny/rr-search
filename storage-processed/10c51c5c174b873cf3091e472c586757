Straw has a pretty good texture for fruiting uncased, and the hollow straw holds a LOT of water, negating the need for a casing layer, providing you maintain near 100% humidity at the surface of the straw.<br />Try laying a sheet of wax paper over the surface of the straw.  Lift it to fan, and change it out daily or at least every second day with a fresh sheet.<br />RR"}}
