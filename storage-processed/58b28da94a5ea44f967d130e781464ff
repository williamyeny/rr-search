It's awfully hard to defend when someone asks how much a glass jar will yield, without even a hint at what's INSIDE the jar, or \"I no 1/8 is like 3.5 grams so what would 1/8 be dry?\" as if 3.5 grams of feathers somehow weighs more than 3.5 grams of lead.<br />Somebody seriously needs to study up, and at least do a bit of proof-reading prior to entering a post.
