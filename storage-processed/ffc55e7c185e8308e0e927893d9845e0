They're just for humidity.  The original straw log tek was written for open air fruiting, and laundry baskets of straw do fine in an open room.  It helps to cover them with a piece of plastic sheeting during colonization to hold the CO2 in a bit, and also cover them with sheeting during primordia formation to hold humidity, but be sure to uncover a few times per day for air exchange.  Once mushrooms form, you can leave it uncovered.  It helps to run a humidifier or two in the room.<br />RR"}}
