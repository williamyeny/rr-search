It DOES matter if you sterilize your casing layer.  It will perform poorly.  It's a well known fact that the beneficial organisms in a casing layer stimulate pinning.  This was very well known in 1985 when Paul Stamets wrote 'The Mushroom Cultivator' and it's still known today.  Casing layers should be pasteurized, not sterilized.<br />In addition, coir is a substrate material, not a casing material.  If you wish to use it for casing, it should be mixed at the 60/40 ratio (60% verm, 40% coir) in the tek, or better yet, 70/30.  However, peat mixed 50/50 with verm is a far superior casing.  The reason peat works better is the beneficial micro organisms that are not present in as high a concentration in coir.<br />Furthermore, sterilizing a casing makes it MORE prone to contaminants, not less.  A sterile substrate is a prime breeding ground for the first organism to land on it, or the fastest growing.  Mold mycelium, being imperfect fungi grow and sporulate much faster than mushroom mycelium because they get to skip the fruiting body stage.<br />Field capacity for casing layers says when you pick up a handful of material no water should drip out.  If you squeeze gently a few drops will fall, and if you squeeze hard, a small stream will fall.  It sounds like your casing might be getting prepared too dry as well.<br />Fanning 4 to 5 times per day is not sufficient unless you have another method of providing fresh air exchange.  It is recommended to have 4 air exchanges per hour, not day.<br />My suggestion is to use a peat/verm casing with gypsum added(very important) at a rate of one part to each ten parts of peat, and limed to an initial pH of 7.5 to 8.  Pasteurize, don't sterilize and increase air exchange.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pinning strategy critique"}}
