They restrict airflow which leads to contaminants rather than preventing them.  Air exchange and turbulence are the keys to avoiding contaminants in fruiting chambers.  Just leave the lid cracked while you're gone to work, and have enough well drained perlite to keep up the humidity level.  This means purchasing a mechanical hygrometer.  You can get them from cigar shops for less than $20.  Calibrate once per week.<br />RR"}}
