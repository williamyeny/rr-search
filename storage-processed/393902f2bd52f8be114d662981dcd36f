I don't know where this 'too high humidty' crap originally started, but it's incorrect and mushrooms thrive in 99% humidity.  Drain off any standing water and add well drained perlite until it's three to five inches deep, and provide plenty of fresh air.  It sounds like you need to make a run to the store to get more perlite.<br />RR"}}
