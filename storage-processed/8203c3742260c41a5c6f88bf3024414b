With total saturation, you will never get a good pinset because your substrate remains at a steady-state moisture level. That explains the poor performance.&nbsp; <br />Peroxide breaks down very fast in the presence of light and organic matter, so it wasn't effective more than the first few hours.&nbsp; While you thought the peroxide was releasing O2, after the first day or two it wasn't.&nbsp; In addition, mushrooms don't want oxygen, they want the CO2 removed. 19% O2 is perfect for mushrooms.&nbsp; Even if one were to hook an oxygen tank to a fruiting chamber, performance would be no better than in a fruiting chamber with proper fresh air exchange using normal atmospheric air.<br />That mushroom is not only suffering from an extremely high CO2 level as indicated by the long stem, but it's also suffering from insufficient light, as indicated by the tiny cap.<br />RR","title":"Re: Experimental: Self Sufficient Chamber + Contam Test"}}
