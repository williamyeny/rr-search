If you can't afford a laminar flow hood, build a still air box.  Working in the open air is preferable to putting a computer fan on a glovebox which will only cause turbulence that will blow contaminants into your work.  This has all be covered hundreds of times in the last few years, so no reason to repeat it all in detail here.  Don't be deceived into thinking that a sheet of tyvek or a $20 vacuum cleaner filter is going to replace a flow hood, even if wal mart does label it 'hepa'.<br />RR"}}
