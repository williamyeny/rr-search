They're always thrilled to have someone come haul it off for them.  All you have to do is knock on the door with a bag in your hand(or a pickup truck) and ask.  Get the field aged and dry stuff from the pasture, not the fresh green stuff they sweep out of the stalls.  What you want will be dry and brown, bleached by the sun and leached by the rain.  It will have zero smell other than a slight 'dirt' or earthy smell, but no ammonia or manure stink.<br />RR"}}
