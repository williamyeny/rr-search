You said daytime temperatures are 58, then said, (day=68).  There's a big difference between 58F and 68F.  They'll fruit outdoors in 58F weather just fine, but that's too cold to get good performance in a terrarium.  68F will do better, and 75 is better yet, but that isn't the reason for the tiny fruits.<br />Provided other parameters are correct, moisture content of the substrate, and the food value of the substrate determine fruit size.  IF your humidity was too low, the caps would be cracking(scaling), which they're not.  What are your cakes made of?  Did you change the recipe at all, or use white rice instead of brown?  Those look like some cubes I grew once on sawdust/woodchips, which is not an appropriate substrate.  <br />RR"}}
