If you kept it there for 90 minutes after a 24 hour soak and simmer, you can be sure the bacterial endospores were killed off at <i>that</i> time.<br />In my experience, the biggest cause of bacillus is wet filter material on jars.  I can't emphasize that enough, because it bit my butt for six months before I figured it out.  In my case, I was using plastic lids with synthetic filter disks, which with plastic lids must be placed on the inside of the jar where it gets wet from not only condensation, but gets grain juice on it when you shake the jars.  Bacteria can grow and colonize right through wet filter material, whether it be filter disks, polyfil, tyvek or even a verm layer. Remember, bacteria are floating in the air all around us, and out bodies are covered with billions of them. We puke them out by the millions as we breathe. Filters must stay absolutely dry. That's why I recommend using the original metal mason jar lids, with two small 1/16\" (1/2 mm) holes drilled into the lid, with the filter disk or tyvek above that and the metal ring screwed on last.  This setup keeps your filter dry.  Another thing is to be sure to remove the foil after you remove your jars from the PC.  Foil will keep the filter material below it damp.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
