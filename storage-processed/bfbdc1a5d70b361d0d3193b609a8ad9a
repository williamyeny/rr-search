Look in the paint section for tyvek coveralls.  They can be cut up to make a hundred or more jar filters for five bucks.<br />Rye berries can be obtained from any health food store.  If you just get a small amount, they'll whack you by the pound, usually around 79 cents or so.  If you'll have them order a 25 pound bag, the price drops by half or more.<br />Peat is the old standard casing mix. Potting soil also works, but often has wood debris in it that is prone to trichoderma contamination. Coir is better used as a substrate unless you mix it 60/40 coir-verm, but is still prone to overlay.  It will work in a bind though, but peat moss stays largely uncolonized, which allows it to do its job of serving as a moisture reservoir for the developing fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing and Rye Grain Problems"}}
