Completely normal, and this cake went on to flush several times.  Mycelium often produces metabolites of different colors depending on what infection they're fighting.  This red color was on the top of the verm barrier where the mycelium had worked it's way up to where contaminants had entered through the vent hole and were laying dormant on the verm barrier.  When the mycelium reached that spot, it produced metabolites(antibiotic compounds) to kill the mold spores or bacteria that were present in that location.<br />Touching your cakes can leave all sorts of nasties on them, which the mycelium then produces antibiotic compounds to ward them off.<br />The other thing that can produce color is Geotrichum, but it will usually be apparent as a mold and spreading rapidly.  If your red color was where it was touched and is not spreading, then it's most likely metabolic discharges, which are the stuff antibiotics prescribed by doctors are made from.<br />RR","title":"Re: Red brusing on cubensies mycellium?"}}
