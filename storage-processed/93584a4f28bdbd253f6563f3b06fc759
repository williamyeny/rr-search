Once egos get put aside, cakes are actually not a bad way to grow at all.<br />Cakes make excellent spawn to bulk substrates.  You can use them to inoculate horse manure, coir, coffee, etc, and substantially increase yields.  However, simply breaking up cakes and adding a casing layer that has no food for the mycelium does little good, and runs the risk of destroying all your work to get to that point.  I suggest either spawning cakes to a bulk substrate or doing a dunk and roll, but forget about crumble and case.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing 101?"}}
