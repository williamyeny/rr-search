It was just overall a failed experiment (most certainly failed on my part).<br />The next time I tried I used brown rice, which I think I burnt in the oven, crushed up some of it to try to make something akin to flour (but used this very sparingly), and the vermiculite. I must have done something better or avoided a previous error, because the substrate didn't get the goop effect. It was kind of clumpy. I was worried that it wasn't moist enough because it just didn't seem like it, but then I remembered reading posts on this forum of people commenting on photos with stuff like 'looks like you used too much water.' So I thought well maybe I am almost falling for that mistake. So I didn't add more water.<br />Then I put the jars in a large pot and filled it with water just over the jars, and I boiled them for 30 minutes with a glass lid on the pot. I honestly do not know the difference between this and a pressure cooker, but I was trying to get as close as I could to the pressure cooker effect.<br />So now I guess I gotta see if and how badly contamination grows.</blockquote><br />You did just about everything wrong that you could have done wrong.&nbsp; That is not the procedure at all.<br />It's the wrong recipe.<br />Don't mix the verm and rice flour and then add water.<br />It takes 90 minutes to steam sterilize, not half an hour.<br />Never let the water touch your jars during the sterilization.&nbsp; Only the steam should touch the jars.<br />I'd suggest you follow the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek videos</a> next time.&nbsp; There's been a few thousand brand new growers succeed on their very first time using them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Has anyone tried just mimcking nature before?"}}
