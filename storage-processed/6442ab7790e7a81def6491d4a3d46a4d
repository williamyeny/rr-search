Bacillus has the 'ability' to form endospores when environmental conditions are not favorable for survival, but bacillus is very common in water, soil, your digestive tract and breath, and airborne dust.  When this bacillus laden dust or your own bad breath settles on a wet filter, it can germinate and colonize right through the filter to the grains below.  This is why filter material must be kept totally dry once it's removed from the PC.  It's normal for the filter to get a bit damp in the PC, but it should be allowed to dry as soon as possible after removal.<br />RR"}}
