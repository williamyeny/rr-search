Just eyeball it.  Anywhere from 5% to 10% is fine. Lime isn't necessary in bulk substrates, but don't forget to use it if/when you use a casing layer.  It's necessary for casing material because it doesn't fully colonize with mushroom mycelium, and therefore the uncolonized parts are susceptible to contamination.<br />Mushroom size, provided you used a good substrate is related to moisture content.  If you had coir/coffee then you had a good substrate.  I'd speculate the small fruits were related to not having enough moisture.  Next time, dunk after full colonization.  I like to make my substrates up a tad on the dry side because they colonize faster that way and are less prone to contamination.  Then, at full colonization, give a 6 hour dunk to re-hydrate the substrate before placing into fruiting conditions.<br />RR","title":"Re: coir and gypsum"}}
