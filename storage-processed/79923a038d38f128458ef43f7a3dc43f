However, the mushrooms themselves if there is no mold on them are safe to eat.  Wild mushrooms exist in nature with all sorts of molds and bacteria, and commercial mushroom farms certainly don't toss out the fruits from substrates with moulds, nor to the health regulators require or expect them to.<br />It's still best to toss out any substrate you see at the very first sign of green.  Keeping them only reduces the chances you can have future successful grows due to the huge amount of contaminant spores that will be spit out everywhere.<br />RR"}}
