If you're using a syringe in a glovebox, polyfill is probably better. Keep the grains well down from the lid by filling the jar 2/3 full. If you have a flowhood and are using agar wedges or grain to grain transfers, I prefer tyvek or synthetic filter disks.<br />RR","title":"Re: some good ways to seal jars for colonization?"}}
