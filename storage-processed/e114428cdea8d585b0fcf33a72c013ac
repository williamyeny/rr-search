Either your humidifier is set for too long a run time, or the temperature inside the greenhouse is warmer than the temperature outside.  If using coolmist(s), give them no longer than a few minutes of run time before shutting down to allow the air to absorb the moisture.  After a few minutes of 'off' time, set them to come back on.  That measure alone will prevent moisture buildup on the walls, trays and floor.<br />As creamcorn said, your tray is several days away from the fruiting chamber anyway, as you need to case, then cover with foil while the casing runs.<br />RR"}}
