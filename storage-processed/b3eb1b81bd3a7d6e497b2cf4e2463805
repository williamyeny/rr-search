I'd keep part of the mycelium in the dish, and then wrap it up well and put in the refrigerator.&nbsp; If it turns out to be a great fruiting strain, you'll have an earlier version of it to use for your next grow. <br />The other dish needs a few transfers.&nbsp; The smaller the chunks you transfer, the fewer strains you'll move to the next dish, thus making the isolations easier.<br />The top dish may have started out with fewer spores, thus was easier to isolate.<br />RR"}}
