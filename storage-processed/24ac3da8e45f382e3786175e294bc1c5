After that, you can take it off because the dry vermiculite is the filter.  Masking tape won't breath.  The tape is simply to help keep water out of the holes.  If you'll elevate the jars totally out of the water during sterilization, you don't need tape.  Simply cover the lids with foil to prevent the condensation that drips off the lid of the kettle or pressure cooker from entering the holes.<br />If you use medical tape such as micropore or other 'breathable' tape, you can leave it in place and inoculate right through it.<br />You can remove the jars when the pressure cooker returns to zero pressure, but I'd still wait a little while.  If you remove the jars while they're too hot, they can loose some of their mosture content to evaporation.  Overnight is not necessary, but if you're going to lt them sit anyway, the PC is a fine place to leave them.   If you need to cook another batch, then there's no harm in removing them.  <br />Allow to cool to near room temp before inoculating.<br />RR","title":"Re: Day 1 Questions"}}
