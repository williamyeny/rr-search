I went through at least ten cool mists per year until I set them INside the greenhouse, and I'm on the same two coolmists for nearly two years now.<br />Sure, put your stuff in.  Don't sweat the temperature.  It's normal for the mist to drop the temp as the humidity comes up by evaporative cooling, much like a swamp cooler works in the desert.  The temp will equalize with the room soon.<br />RR"}}
