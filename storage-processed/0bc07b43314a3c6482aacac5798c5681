Make sure you decrease your fruiting chamber humidity a few hours before harvest, and don't mist.  Allow the substrate and the mushrooms themselves to dry out a bit.  This keeps them fresher in the refrigerator than if they're soggy wet.<br />You shouldn't freeze any mushrooms until after they've been cooked.<br />RR"}}
