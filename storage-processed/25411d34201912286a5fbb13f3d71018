Can anyone give me some advice as to what I'm doing wrong?<br />Also I know pf tek isn't great for edibles, but I was hoping to at least get some decent prints or cultures out of this lot.<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/14-18/866807516-image.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/14-18/866807516-thumb_image.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/14-18/866806772-image.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/14-18/866806772-thumb_image.jpg\"></a><br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/14-18/866808242-image.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/14-18/866808242-thumb_image.jpg\"></a></blockquote><br />Lack of both fresh air and light.&nbsp; Set it in a sunny location and take the lid off or something.&nbsp; They need massive fresh air, much more than cubes.<br />It's probably <i>Hypsizygus ulmarius</i>, often referred to as elm oyster.<br />RR","title":"Re: Oyster ulmarius growing really small on pf tek"}}
