More chance of contamination yes, but only if you're using a substrate that the contamination can digest easily. Brown rice flour for example is easy for the molds to digest while cow poop isn't.</blockquote><br />Are you suggesting that people inject spores directly into cow manure?&nbsp; If you inject a lot of mold spores into brf or grains, they'll grow much faster than the mushroom spores and will take over the project.&nbsp; If you inject spores directly into manure, nothing will happen.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>InTheRainySeason said:</strong><br />So by telling people to use less spores per syringe and use the pf tek, people that sell spores are making a shitload of money cause the people that buy from them get contaminations and have to buy more. I think they want you to fail. </blockquote><br />That is absolute nonsense.&nbsp; No vendor wants anyone to fail using their product, and I also advise to use less spores per syringe, and I sure as hell don't want to see people fail when following my guidance.&nbsp; Don't even insinuate such a thing.&nbsp; Every print has some contamination unless it was taken in outer space.&nbsp; The more mold spores you inject into a substrate, the more the chance of failure becomes, because molds grow much faster than mushroom mycelium.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>InTheRainySeason said:</strong><br />Plus, when they sell a spore syringe with one sixteenth of a spore print in it, they'll make a shitload more money that way than if they just sold a syringe for the same price but with a whole print in it, or half a print, or one eight of a print. </blockquote><br />One normal sized print is the correct amount to use for up to ten syringes.&nbsp; More spores are not better.&nbsp; Many strains are non-compatible and therefore don't merge into a common organism via the process of anastomosis.&nbsp; The least amount of spores you can use is best, since even one print to ten syringes gives millions of spores per syringe.&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of spores is NOT better.<br />RR","title":"Re: Making syringe by placing whole foil print into jar of sterilized water?"}}
