It's actually good in my experience because it tends to increase diversity.  For example, shooting half a jar with PR and the other half with Thai will yield no 'fighting' or 'competition'.  You may or may not get a cross, but in my experience after hundreds of mixes that way, there is no detrimental effect, and it's just like any other multispore inoculation.<br />Different species should be cultivated apart from each other.  There is a big difference between 'strain' and 'species'.  You wouldn't want to cultivate cubensis and shiitake in the same substrate, for example.<br />RR"}}
