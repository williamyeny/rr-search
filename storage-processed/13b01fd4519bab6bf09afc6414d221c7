A large bag of substrate will take much longer than a small bag, but you can't do it with the oven only on 170 or it will take overnight at least.<br />Ovens and microwaves are terrible for pasteurization.  Ovens are bad because air is a poor conductor of heat, and it's hard to get a thermometer into your substrate in an oven without drying it out.  Microwaves don't pasteurize, they partially sterilize which is less than desirable.<br />I prefer to pasteurize in a large pot of water.   Do whatever you have to do to get the center of your bag of substrate to reach 140F to 170F for one hour.<br />RR"}}
