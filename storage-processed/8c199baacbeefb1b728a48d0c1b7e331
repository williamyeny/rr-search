I don't recommend trying to save a project with green molds.  You spread too many spores by handling it.  Remember, the green is the spores, the trichoderma mycelium is white.  Any mushrooms you pick from a casing with green molds are ok to eat, but the tray itself should be removed from the growing room as soon as it is noticed.  After moving the tray outside, your whole body will be covered with trich spores, so be sure to shower and change clothes before you enter your growing environment.<br />RR"}}
