A humidifier will either flood your substrates, or dry them out, depending on how accurate of a cycle timer you buy, and how much time you're willing to spend babysitting it.  Holes for FAE and perlite will work fine.<br />There's no such thing as 'fire and forget it' with mushroom growing.  You need to check daily, mist, and inspect for contamination.<br />Mushrooms NEED LIGHT for more than direction.
