It's impossible to heat your jars to 100C/212F in a microwave and still have moisture left in the jar.&nbsp; That's simple physics.&nbsp; If there was no bacteria in your brown rice, you might be OK.&nbsp; The microwave can kill mold spores because they die at well below boiling temps.&nbsp; Not so for bacteria, especially if endospores are present.<br />RR<br />"}}
