You want an initial pH of around 8 for casing material.  Cut the lime back to 1/4 cup and you should be good to go if you can't afford a tester.  For peat based casing mixes, one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat works out about right.  You don't count the verm when figuring the amount of lime.  Be sure to mix the dry peat and dry lime before adding moisture, otherwise it doesn't mix well, creating dead zones.<br />RR","title":"Re: Oyster shells too gritty?"}}
