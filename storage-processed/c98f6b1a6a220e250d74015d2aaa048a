I think i've worked out most of the kinks with my basic setup & maintenance, and believe my next attempt will be more productive as i hone my technique. Although just beginning, i have an extensive background in research. As i continue to refine my procedural craft, i see where i can attempt to experiment with cakes' nutritional and structural variables to potentially alter yields.:</blockquote><br />There's nothing wrong with experimenting.&nbsp; Be sure to keep accurate notes, because after a while it's hard to remember what combination is in which jar.<br />We generally advise new growers not to experiment until they learn the basics, but certainly if you don't mind a high fail rate, it's an excellent way to speed up the learning curve.<br />RR","title":"Re: Experimenting with nutritional & structural variables in basic cakes"}}
