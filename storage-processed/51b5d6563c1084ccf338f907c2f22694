Pf cakes are already 2/3 vermiculite, so when you destroy the cake, and then the only thing you do is dump more inert material over the top of it, all you do is shock it for nothing.  If you're going to crumble up a cake, the least you should do is spawn it to manure or coir so it has some food to help it recover.  All a casing layer does is supply moisture, which can much more efficiently be done with dunking.  Dunking doesn't destroy the cake in the process, so you get your fruits much sooner with less chance of contamination.<br />RR","title":"Re: I think my casing went south"}}
