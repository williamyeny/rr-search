It works best if you mix it with some manure, and even the composted cow manure from nurseries works well mixed with the garden compost.  Add a small amount of bagged chicken manure from the nursery and you have a great substrate.  If it seems thick, cut it with a bit of vermiculite and/or coir.  You can also add perlite to bulk substrates to fluff them up.  The perlite holds air, which comes in handy in manure based substrates.  You can also throw in a few days worth of spent coffee grinds.   In other words, the more different things you add to your substrate, the better it will perform.<br />RR","title":"Re: Leaf compost?"}}
