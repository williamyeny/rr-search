Cubes are a SPECIES, and they all grow under the same conditions in the same substrates, under the same temperatures, moisture contents, etc.  It seems that everyone who makes a print these days gives it a name and calls it a new strain, which is total bullshit.  As far as growing parameters are concerned, cubes are cubes, period.<br />RR"}}
