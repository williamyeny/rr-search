Something is wrong or they'd be done by now.  Most likely bacteria if you used an LC that hadn't been proved on agar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will do no good to spawn contaminated grains to manure, whether or not you remove the 'uncolonized' parts.  Try posting a picture or look at the pictures in contamination of wetspot.  It would be my guess, provided your jars had fitered gas exchange provision.  Running out of air also causes stalling, as does overly wet grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6187788</next>\n<prev>6187746</prev>\n<first>6187705</first>\n<last>6187788</last>\n<when>1161309669</when>\n<utime>10/20/06 05:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
