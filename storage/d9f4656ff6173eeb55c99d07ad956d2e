Mushrooms don't fruit hydroponically, although if you leave a lc long enough for a film to form on top, they've been known to sprout a pin or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a microscope for the first person to develop a hydroponic tek for growing mushrooms, and I'm fairly certain I'll get to keep that microscope to give to my grandkids someday.
