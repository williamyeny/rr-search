There is nothing wrong with eating a mushroom from a cake or substrate with mold.  Every mushroom in nature exists in harmony with molds, and wild mushrooms are highly sought after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't eat rotten mushrooms because bacteria causes food poisoning.  However, molds are not 'sucked up' by the mycelium and into the fruitbodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We toss out projects with molds because we don't want to be cultivating and spreading molds in our grow areas, but any healthy mushrooms you pick first are ok to eat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6257670</next>\n<prev>6254400</prev>\n<first>6250592</first>\n<last>6260506</last>\n<when>1162858546</when>\n<utime>11/07/06 02:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
