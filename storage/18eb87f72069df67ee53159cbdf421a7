A side benefit to gypsum is that calcium and sulphur are both nutrients used in mycelial metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we know, mushroom mycelium grows fastest and is perhaps the happiest with a ph of around 6.  Unfortunately, that is also the ph favored by most other fungi, which includes the mold fungi that are the enemy.  We use lime because mushroom mycelium can &lt;i&gt;tolerate&lt;/i&gt; a higher ph than the green molds can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reason stated above, I prefer hydrated lime over calcium carbonate to adjust the casing mix because the most critical time to protect your casing layer is right after you put it on and are waiting for it to colonize.  The hydrated lime, being water soluable goes to work right away to protect during that critical time.  Once the casing layer is colonized, the mushroom mycelium does an amazing job of holding its own against contaminants, and the gypsum then provides the long term stabilizer, preventing the ph from going too low.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6151533</prev>\n<first>6151301</first>\n<last>6152007</last>\n<when>1160450875</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 06:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
