I don't preseal, but use a tyvek wrist sleve in each bag.&nbsp; I sterilize in a 55 gallon drum outdoors, and then open it and put the sterilized substrates in a wheel barrow and roll them across the lawn to the house.&nbsp; When the bags cool, they pull a vacuum and the wrist sleeve prevents the entry of contaminants 100%.&nbsp; When I pull the wrist sleeve out to inoculate in front of the flow hood, I can see the bag inflate as the vacuum is broken.<br />RR"}}
