{"key":"post-7843953","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7843953</id>\n<content>I used 1/4&quot; drill bit.  I never counted the holes.  I just wing it.  However, a 3/8&quot; hole is more than twice the size of a 1/4&quot; hole, so you'll need to use less than half as many.  I've had better success with this style terrarium by using more holes of a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7843983</next>\n<prev>7843860</prev>\n<first>7103036</first>\n<last>7844697</last>\n<when>1199743291</when>\n<utime>01/08/08 12:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
