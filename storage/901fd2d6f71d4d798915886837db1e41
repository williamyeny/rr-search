Don't invent your own methods until you learn the established ways.  Study and learn.  If you're interested in so-called 'strains' then check the strain thread which is a sticky at the top of the page.  If you're groing cubensis, it doesn't matter what spores you get, so pick one that you like the 'name' and order it.  Cubes all grow the same since they're all the same species.  Read the pf tek and follow it to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6906028</prev>\n<first>6905911</first>\n<last>6906046</last>\n<when>1179000068</when>\n<utime>05/12/07 11:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
