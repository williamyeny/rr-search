Dim light will produce a few pins, bright light will produce far more.  See if you can find a color temperature on the led string. The best color temperature for most mushroom species seems to be 6,000 Kelvin to 7500 Kelvin. LEDs are the wave of the future, and now they're able to tune them to specific colors.  If they're bright white, you should be good to go.  My best experience with lighting is with natural daylight fluorescent, but LEDs could very well equal that performance as they develop the technology.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8466153</next>\n<prev>8466095</prev>\n<first>8465103</first>\n<last>8477961</last>\n<when>1212214654</when>\n<utime>05/31/08 09:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
