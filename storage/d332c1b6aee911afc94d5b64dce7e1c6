In addition, peroxide weakens the mushroom mycelium, slowing it way down.&amp;nbsp; It may kill mold spores, but fruits from the wild also have live mold mycelium which recovers from the peroxide faster than the mushroom mycelium, thus you defeat the purpose.&amp;nbsp; Don't use it.&amp;nbsp; If you want to dip in anything, use a dilute iodine mix.&amp;nbsp; I don't use any chemicals, but instead make a series of transfers to isolate the healthy mycelium from the molds and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cardboard is OK for outdoor grows, but you won't be able to transfer from cardboard to grains with any decent rate of success.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10668077</next>\n<prev>10667945</prev>\n<first>10667712</first>\n<last>10671859</last>\n<when>1247498144</when>\n<utime>07/13/09 06:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
