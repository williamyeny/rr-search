I and others have reported a higher incidence of bacterial contamination with popcorn than other materials used as spawn.  Thanks for the information on endospores.  I'll look into that further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaming in this thread is going to stop.  Nobody has said popcorn doesn't work or that pictures lie.  What has been said is there are other, more reliable methods of expanding mycelium, which has been acknowledged.  There will be no more twisting of peoples words to stir up trouble.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6596798</next>\n<prev>6596778</prev>\n<first>6265957</first>\n<last>12220848</last>\n<when>1172159962</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 05:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
