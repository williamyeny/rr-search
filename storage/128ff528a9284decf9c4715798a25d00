Just make sure the total magnesium content is less than 5%  My friend got this bag at Lowes.  It's less than 1% mg.   If you adjust your casing to a ph of 8-9, the contams won't like it, and the mushies will love it.  If anyone thinks that's a high ph, he sets his straw to a ph of 11, and the mycelium rips through it in 2 weeks or less.  Contams are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/032303-8/89949-lime1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/032303-8/89949-thumb_lime1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>1411105</prev>\n<first>1410415</first>\n<last>1411536</last>\n<when>1048706066</when>\n<utime>03/26/03 09:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
