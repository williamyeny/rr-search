This is the neutral connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange and red get tied together and insulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black and whatever that color I can't read get tied together and hooked to the black from your supply cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green on your supply cord goes to the chassis ground.  There should be a green screw for it to attach to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The browns should already be connected to the capacitor.  If not, you'll see the wires from the capacitor.  It's the 'can' looking thing that is usually attached to the side of the motor.  Since it doesn't change whether 115 or 230 volts is used, I'm sure it's already prewired.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6666212</next>\n<prev>6665812</prev>\n<first>6658814</first>\n<last>6666845</last>\n<when>1173833112</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 03:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
