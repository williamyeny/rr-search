It worked fine.  With a mini greenhouse, I purposely made a very sloppy fitting door that is open from top to bottom.  This provides a constant air exchange which helps to stimulate pinning as well as to inhibit contaminant molds. As hyphae said, you must have a constant rate of evaporation from the casing surface for proper pin formation.  Stagnant air prevents that evaporation and encourages mold growth.<br />RR"}}
