When I wasn't working, I wanted to be hiking or camping, etc., but not staying around home all the time. If you set up a fan or otherwise try to 'automate' the system which is designed to be self sufficient, you'll dry out your substrates and ruin them.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Follow the tek</a> to the letter and you'll be fine while gone to work.&nbsp; That's the purpose of a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; It's as close to maintenance free as you can get.&nbsp; Put your 6500K lights on a 12/12 timer and mist mornings and evenings.<br />RR"}}
