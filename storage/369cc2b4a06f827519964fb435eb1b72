Okay let me explain it to YOU a little better.<br /> Why does it seem that cultivation of Mushrooms is so cut and dry.<br /> With all the experience and all the wisdom and all the people that come here does it seem that I don't know an area of research is missing. hence&nbsp; cut and dry, meaning in a BROAD sense you can't manipulate a mushroom anymore like the thc in bud! That's just one thing but...<br />&nbsp; What about those of us who used to read stories like this \"how to grow a pound of mushrooms\" or \"How to Render the active substance found in Mushrooms\" something like that...... I guess If you don't get it then fuck, FORGET IT!</blockquote><br />WTF are you talking about?<br />The last thing growing mushrooms is is cut and dry.&nbsp; We have members here growing thousands of pounds of mushrooms.&nbsp; WTF is this about how to grow a pound?&nbsp; You do that in a terrarium in a few weeks.&nbsp; There have been so many extraction threads, I started locking them.&nbsp; This isn't a drug manufacture board.<br />Before you trash our members, get your own house in order.<br />RR"}}
