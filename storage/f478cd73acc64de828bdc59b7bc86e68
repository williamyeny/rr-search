Sterilization is never complete, and is time sensitive.  Sterilized media should be used as soon as possible.  Every day you wait, decreases the chances of success.  Waiting a week or two almost always works out ok.  Longer than that, and you're playing roulette.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7598220</next>\n<prev>7598175</prev>\n<first>7597890</first>\n<last>7598220</last>\n<when>1194288807</when>\n<utime>11/05/07 08:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
