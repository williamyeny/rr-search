In fact, with Shiitake, I often prune most of the pins so the ones that stay grow as big as portabellos and much better suited for grilling, which is my favorite way to eat them.  You can also apply that technique to cubes, although some will consider it heresy.<br />Normally, side pinning isn't caused by light coming in the sides, but rather something wrong with the casing layer such as Ph or improper moisture content that the mycelium avoids.<br />RR"}}
