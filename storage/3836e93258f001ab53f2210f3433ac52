If you have cobweb, you can hit it with some 3%, which is the strength it comes from if you buy it in a drug or grocery store in the US. In some other countries, it comes in 10% strength from the pharmacy. I would never dunk with it that strong though, as it would be detrimental to the mushroom mycelium.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunk after birthing your cakes for 24 to 36 hours, followed by a roll in dry vermiculite.  By mixing up your cakes on the dry side, they will colonize much faster, and then you can hydrate them with the water required for the flush by dunking.  This is hands down the fastest way to get a nice flush from cakes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7066594</next>\n<prev>7066333</prev>\n<first>7066024</first>\n<last>7072118</last>\n<when>1182294771</when>\n<utime>06/20/07 02:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
