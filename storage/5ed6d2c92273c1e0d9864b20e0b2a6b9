People mistakenly think of mushrooms as plants, thus the obsessing over 'nutes'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wbs and rye are much better than popcorn mainly due to their suitability for mushroom growing.  Corn has such large kernels, that there is very little actual mycelium in a given sized jar of corn compared to a jar the same size of rye or wbs.  You have to remember the mycelium colonizes the surface of the grains, therefore smaller grains will have far more surface area than larger grains, thus much more mycelium in the jar.  Corn also has other problems such as high starch content, and high endospore counts which lead to contamination more often than rye.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7046731</next>\n<prev>7046681</prev>\n<first>7046483</first>\n<last>7046796</last>\n<when>1181858370</when>\n<utime>06/15/07 12:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
