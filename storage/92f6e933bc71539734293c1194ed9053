It's normal to feel a bit of nausia when tripping.  If it is really bad, try boiling the mushrooms into a tea, then straining off the mushroom material and drinking only the tea.  Raw mushrooms are non digestable and sometimes that triggers a reflex in our systems that makes us want to puke.  It can ruin your trip, that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5479581</next>\n<prev>5477727</prev>\n<first>5477585</first>\n<last>5479581</last>\n<when>1144166235</when>\n<utime>04/04/06 06:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
