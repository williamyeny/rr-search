Inoculation was done with the lid open for a few seconds in my kitchen in open air. The second was grain to grain. Third, grain to popcorn. Fourth, popcorn to grain. All G2G were done under the same conditions. Open air, me digging and feeding the new jars with a spoon.<br />The grain colonized in 2.5-3 weeks. One popcorn jar colonized in 3 days, the rest a few more days. Also the temp was quite low, a maximum of 25 C / 77 F.</blockquote><br />It appears you're making a common new grower mistake in thinking if it's white, it's right.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that isn't the case.&nbsp; I give this zero chance of ever producing fruits. Sorry.<br />RR"}}
