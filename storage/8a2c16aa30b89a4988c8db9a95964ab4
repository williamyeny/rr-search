If you birth it and fruit it, it will undoubtably be contaminated. You could dip it in a 10% bleach sol. followed by a rinse except&lt;br /&gt;2. If it is pinning, it will continue to pin after you break it up. It's ok for next years outdoor bed, but if you spawn it it will continue to flush, at least once. That tends to cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF are you talking about?&amp;nbsp; We've known for years that you can break up pinning spawn and use it to inoculate bulk.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't contaminate at any higher rate than normal.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium and can easily be broken up with the brf or grains and spawned to bulk, as proved by thousands of growers who clone fruit bodies to use as future spawn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12464829</next>\n<prev>12464474</prev>\n<first>12464395</first>\n<last>12467173</last>\n<when>1272389007</when>\n<utime>04/27/10 08:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
