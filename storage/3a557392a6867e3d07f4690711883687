A substrate in a tub is simply a substrate, just as it would be if it were not in a tub or tray, such as a straw log.  If you put a casing layer on it, it becomes a cased substrate.  The 'casing' itself is the casing layer.  <br />I promise I'm not nitpicking, but it's much easier when everybody is on the same page as far as terms go.  The terminology as I stated above is standard in the commercial mushroom industry, as well as the way stamets and others have written.<br />RR"}}
