We hear of ten times as many problems with incubators going south on people as we hear of people complaining that a jar took an extra two or three days to colonize due to being at room temperature.  Save yourselves some headaches and throw away the silly things.   If it's winter in your area, just run a small space heater in your room.  If you're comfortable in a t-shirt, your mycelium will be quite happy sitting on a shelf in that same room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a polar bear and keep your AC at a very low temperature, just find a closet or other out of the way place to keep your jars at 75F or so and they'll do just fine. You also don't need to worry about normal indoor lighting.  It has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  Light only becomes a pinning trigger when the other pinning triggers are also induced.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5914590</prev>\n<first>5914570</first>\n<last>5914895</last>\n<when>1154285557</when>\n<utime>07/30/06 09:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
