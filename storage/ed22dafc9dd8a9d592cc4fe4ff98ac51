I generally add the coffee grinds from that mornings coffee pot to the coir.  I've grown oysters, cubes, reishi, pan stipticus, hericium, and a few others on it.  Coir actually works well for both wood lovers and dung and straw lovers.  This is based on several years of tests.  <br />That's why starting back in 2003 I suggested here that people try it as a substrate rather than as a casing which is all it was being used for at that time.  That was pure heresy and I took a lot of shit for saying it, but since that time many growers have produced nice fat crops of high potent cubes, as well as other species on coir alone as a substrate.<br />RR"}}
