CANNA COCO has a complex air/water system, which makes it superior to other substrates. Furthermore, it contains a special mold (Tricoderma), which can protect the plant from soil diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium needs the fiber, so I'd toss that aside for use with plants and not fungi.&amp;nbsp; The trich will probably be killed during pasteurization, but thanks for posting that page.&amp;nbsp; It proves to the naysayers who say NOBODY adds trich to coir as they were just claiming last week, claiming those of us who say some companies add trich are idiots. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>13245329</prev>\n<first>13245100</first>\n<last>13245497</last>\n<when>1285450557</when>\n<utime>09/26/10 12:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
