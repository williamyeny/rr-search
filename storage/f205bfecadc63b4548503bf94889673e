If it was more than 48 hours or so, they're hosed.  It looks like bacteria.  Unfortunately, the colonized jars also look like they have wetspot.  Notice the uncolonized kernels and the greasy appearance around where the grain touches the glass?  If you take another picture, try to light from an angle to get rid of the glare.  If you use a camera flash, you can spray a bit of underarm deodorant on the glass to dissipate the glare from the flash.  Hopefully I'm mistaken, but it doesn't look too good there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5684578</next>\n<prev>5684316</prev>\n<first>5684316</first>\n<last>5686645</last>\n<when>1148869864</when>\n<utime>05/29/06 05:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
