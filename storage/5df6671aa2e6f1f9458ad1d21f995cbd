{"key":"post-8436167","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8436167</id>\n<content>I've long recommended hydrating grains and/or pf cakes with weak coffee.  Somewhere around here is a 50+ page thread on using coffee from 2003 or '04.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing really NOT to do with coffee is dunk with it.  That will stimulate and feed mold spores that land on the cake after birthing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that weak coffee speeds up colonization, and also no doubt that if you use too much coffee it will slow down or stop colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee grinds are better suited for bulk substrates, but liquid coffee is great for hydrating grains or pf cakes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8436178</next>\n<prev>8436142</prev>\n<first>8436092</first>\n<last>8436178</last>\n<when>1211551897</when>\n<utime>05/23/08 05:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
