I'd suggest inoculating some grains, then when they grow out you can use a quart of colonized grains to make over a hundred liquid mycelium syringes within two weeks.  Two weeks after squirting spores into sugar water you hardly even know you have anything, and have no idea at all about quality until you use it and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6865806</next>\n<prev>6851208</prev>\n<first>6849365</first>\n<last>6870879</last>\n<when>1177906172</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 07:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
