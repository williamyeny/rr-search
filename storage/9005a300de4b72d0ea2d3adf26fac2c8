{"key":"post-8000596","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8000596</id>\n<content>I wouldn't use mycelium with more than about 45 days of cell division.  You can certainly go past that point, but growth is slower, and the mycelium is less able to hold it's own.  I use master slants that are stored in the refrigerator at 35F.  When I get mycelium out, I let it grow for a few days and then put it right to grains.  The slant goes right back into the refrigerator, thus after a year, the cells in the master slant have only divided about what they would have in one week at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8001952</next>\n<prev>8000457</prev>\n<first>8000124</first>\n<last>8001952</last>\n<when>1202595737</when>\n<utime>02/10/08 12:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
