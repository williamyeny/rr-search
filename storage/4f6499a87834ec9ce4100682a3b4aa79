It's recommended to mist mushrooms.  Air exchange must be provided because stagnant water sitting on a mushroom in stagnant air for an extended period WILL cause aborts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation does not begin on all surfaces at about 95%. My can of cold beer gets condensation in Arizona in the summer.  I know it's not 95% there. Condensation forms on my windows in winter, even when humidity in the house is less than 50%. Condensation is a function of the temperature differential on either side of a surface. Condensation forms on the warm side. Condensation won't even form on your mushrooms at 100% humidity.  If they get wet, it's because liquid water droplets were thrown on them, not humidity in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;92% humidity will be fine with a good casing layer.  I prefer higher, but lower will also still work, only requiring more frequent misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7840630</next>\n<prev>7840579</prev>\n<first>7840097</first>\n<last>13585701</last>\n<when>1199666277</when>\n<utime>01/07/08 02:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
