If trich or other mold spores land on the mycelium of a fully colonized petri dish, they will remain dormant and hang out there.  They can't germinate and grow on the mushroom mycelium.  However, when you spawn to grains, they begin to grow.   It's very important to wrap your petri dishes with Parafilm or equivalent.  Parafilm will prevent mold spores from getting under the lids of your dishes and inside, while still allowing gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, until you get some parafilm, don't transfer the part of the mycelium that is up against the edge of the dish.  It's more likely to have contaminant spores lingering.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7348599</next>\n<prev>7342890</prev>\n<first>7329815</first>\n<last>7349094</last>\n<when>1188350950</when>\n<utime>08/29/07 04:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
