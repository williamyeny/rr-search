RR, in more recent years has stated that this amount is unnecessary. IIRC; he mentioned (at one point) that 2~3% by volume is about right... He went on to say that a little to much shouldn't hurt anything; but that below 2~3%, the benefits are insignificant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 2.5%; that would be two ounces, or four tablespoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're confusing grains with bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; Those are the measurements of gypsum for manure, coir, straw, sawdust, etc.&amp;nbsp; For grains, use less.&amp;nbsp; In the old days when we'd just dump a cup of dry grains into a jar and then fill it with water to just even with the top of the grains and PC, we'd add a pinch of gypsum between our thumb and forefinger to each jar as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Rye-Grass-Seed-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;rye grass seed preparation video&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we've developed much better procedures which involve rinsing and soaking the grains, use a bit more gypsum, but still not even half as much as we'd use for a bulk substrate.&amp;nbsp; Using more is wasteful, but won't necessarily screw up the grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14562188</next>\n<prev>14561759</prev>\n<first>14557846</first>\n<last>14610747</last>\n<when>1307245098</when>\n<utime>06/05/11 06:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
