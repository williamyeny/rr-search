Next, open each freshly sterilized rye jar one at a time, and pour and twist from the grain master to deliver a small amount into each receiving jar.  Try to have the receiving jars open for no more than five seconds, so plan ahead and work fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean all jars with alcohol before opening.  Wear latex gloves and wash them with alcohol after putting them on.  As said above, use a glovebox, or even better of course is a laminar flow hood.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6658336</next>\n<prev>6658210</prev>\n<first>6658100</first>\n<last>6658336</last>\n<when>1173640879</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 10:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
