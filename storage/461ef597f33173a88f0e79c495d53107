All of the mushrooms you saw were fruiting on the paper.  The grain was the source of inoculation, not the substrate.  I suppose you've seen this other paper project?  Also, it's hard to tell by my thumbnail avitar, but it's a stuffed animal, hand made to look like the cave drawing of the bee-man on the inside cover of GGMM. The bra is a padded cotton one for girls with small boobs.  The cotton padding served as the casing layer.  Hope it doesn't hurt your eyes too much. Good luck with your projects.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-52/363794415-money_1.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/04-52/363794415-thumb_money_1.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-13/208985375-Mushroom_Shaman_006aaa.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-13/208985375-thumb_Mushroom_Shaman_006aaa.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-13/208962316-Bunny_006qa.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-13/208962316-thumb_Bunny_006qa.jpg\"></a>"}}
