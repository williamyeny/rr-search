We used to think verm had no 'nutes' but in reality, nutes are for plants.(oversimplification)&amp;nbsp; Fungi &lt;i&gt;eats&lt;/i&gt; its food, and as the mycelium consumes the substrate, the verm gets consumed too.&amp;nbsp; Most growers who have used plain verm casing layers have seen cobweb overtake it easily. Obviously, the mold is feeding on &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; in the verm. Those who have grown brf cakes through several flushes have seen the cakes shrink in size far beyond the amount of ground brown rice in the cake, so you can see the mycelium is also consuming the verm.&amp;nbsp; Exactly what it's eating or why remains to be determined.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9427459</next>\n<prev>9427406</prev>\n<first>9426674</first>\n<last>9444277</last>\n<when>1229234280</when>\n<utime>12/14/08 07:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
