However, the brf jars I've left for two or three weeks after full colonization due to scheduling have begun pinning within 48 hours of the dunk and roll.  If you birth right at full colonization, they might sit there for a week or two before pinning, which dries them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody can answer how long it takes when you use multispore inoculation.  You never know the strain you have until if/when it fruits.  However, it's rare for a multispore project not to be a fruiting strain.  Usually, enough genes combine to give pretty good odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want 99% humidity for cakes, not 95%, with lots of air exchange.  Three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite will deliver this.  Fan and mist often.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6867242</next>\n<prev>6867215</prev>\n<first>6866996</first>\n<last>6867242</last>\n<when>1178214042</when>\n<utime>05/03/07 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
