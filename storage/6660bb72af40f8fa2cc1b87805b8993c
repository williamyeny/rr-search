With quart jars you could easily do ten G2G if you did them fast, but that would produce over a truckload of spawn and you probably don't need that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another factor to consider is chronological time.&amp;nbsp; If you tried to do three grain to grain transfers a few months apart from each other, senescence would probably set in.&amp;nbsp; One must consider the number of cell divisions as well as the amount of time that has passed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16121784</next>\n<prev>16119189</prev>\n<first>16119177</first>\n<last>16209869</last>\n<when>1335017920</when>\n<utime>04/21/12 05:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
