Light has no effect on <i>colonizing</i> mycelium, good or bad.  There is absolutely no reason to keep petri dishes in the dark.  What you see is totally normal.  Pins form on agar all the time if they are left too long.  Agar/petri dishes are not for expanding mycelium.  They are for germinating spores and isolating away from contaminants and for isolating strains.  I consider the life of mycelium in a petri dish to be around three weeks at room temperature.  After that, anything can happen, such as contaminants or as you got, fruiting.  It's nothing wrong or unusual. Below on the left are fruits forming from mexicana jalisco strain sclerotia, and on the right, cubensis fruiting from agar on a petri dish.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-10/058927567-Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-10/058927567-thumb_Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-01/302731395-petri_dish.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/04-01/302731395-thumb_petri_dish.jpg\"></a>"}}
