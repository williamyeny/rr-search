With cakes, you seem to either get a few mushrooms that get really large, or lots of little ones.  It really doesn't effect total yield very much where they pin from.  You're fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could also be that your cake is a bit dry.  The moisture sinks to the bottom by gravity, so that could be it as well.  Just dunk between flushes.  You might also want to increase the fanning a bit.  They want lots of air exchange/fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5946590</prev>\n<first>5944285</first>\n<last>5946602</last>\n<when>1155121903</when>\n<utime>08/09/06 02:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
