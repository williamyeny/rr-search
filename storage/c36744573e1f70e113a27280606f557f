Spent coffee grinds are an excellent substrate material/additive, and 1/2 the normal drinking strength(or less) liquid coffee can be used to hydrate grains prior to sterilization. It doesn't matter if it's rye or wbs.  If you use it sronger than 1/2 drinking strength, it will slow down colonization.
