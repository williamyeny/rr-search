They're the most un-american and anti-working person company in business, not to mention the largest importer of 'made in china' crap in the entire world.<br />Great news Roadz!  I noticed Lowes had verm last time I was there, but it was the little tiny bags for $5.  Hardly worth it.   I found two other places in our area that stock the thermorock, but they get $20/bag.  Check the phonebook for hydroponic supply places.  They have it, and large bags of coir too.<br />RR"}}
