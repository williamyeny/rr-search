We used an LC to inoculate one master jar about 2 weeks ago and now have a full jar to do 10 g2g's.&amp;nbsp; I had read at one point that you never know if your lc is good or not until it fruits/doesn't fruit? True? Because the master jar looked perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the reason I never have, and never will post an LC tek.&amp;nbsp; Lots of molds are snow-white and never sporulate until exposed to air in a bulk grow.&amp;nbsp; You might or might not be growing 40 jars of mold.&amp;nbsp; The smell test will let you know if the 'majority' of what you're growing is mushroom mycelium, but even that's no guarantee when you use LC.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I wouldn't waste time with it.&amp;nbsp; LC is like playing Russian roulette with two bullets in the cylinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agar to grain to G2G is much faster with guaranteed results, provided you verify your agar culture under the microscope before expanding into grains.&amp;nbsp; Generally, you can see the contaminants on a petri dish because the air exchange stimulates molds to sporulate, but the microscope check is the icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12759239</prev>\n<first>12758979</first>\n<last>12760307</last>\n<when>1276829248</when>\n<utime>06/18/10 05:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
