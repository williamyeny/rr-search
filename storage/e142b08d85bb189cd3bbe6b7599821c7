I've cut several holes in my greenhouse, top, middle and bottom.  Set a cool mist inside in place of the aquarium if you have trouble keeping humidity up after cutting the holes.  If you DO use the aquarium, use a pump to bubble water in it.  Don't heat the aquarium or you'll end up with condensation the sides of your plastic.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5771388</prev>\n<first>5770959</first>\n<last>5771602</last>\n<when>1150806487</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 03:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
