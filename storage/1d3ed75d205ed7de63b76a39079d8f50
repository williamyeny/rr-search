Lime is far more important in casings where part of it never colonizes.  Substrates colonize fully, therefore can hold thier own.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6622181</next>\n<prev>6621888</prev>\n<first>6613560</first>\n<last>6622205</last>\n<when>1172722336</when>\n<utime>03/01/07 06:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
