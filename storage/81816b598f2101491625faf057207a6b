{"key":"post-7429433","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7429433</id>\n<content>There will be a small amount of polyfill inside the jar, but trim it with scissors after inserting so it sticks into the jar no more than 1/4&quot;.  If you're using a syringe in a glovebox, polyfill is probably better. Keep the grains well down from the lid by filling the jar 2/3 full. If you have a flowhood and are using agar wedges or grain to grain transfers, I prefer tyvek or synthetic filter disks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7429615</next>\n<prev>7429222</prev>\n<first>7428615</first>\n<last>7469252</last>\n<when>1190248878</when>\n<utime>09/20/07 03:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
