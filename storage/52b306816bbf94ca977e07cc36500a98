Caps opening early has nothing to do with humidity. There is a 'trusted cultivator' box on the search posts feature to allow you to only return search results from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't 'feel' humidity, and taping over the holes in a shotgun will reduce humidity, not raise it, provided you made it per the tek.&amp;nbsp; Besides, fresh air exchange is the main pinning trigger, and you want all you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn't mention your misting schedule or if you dunked your cakes before placing in the fc.&amp;nbsp; When caps open on small mushrooms, it's an indication of low substrate moisture content.&amp;nbsp; There is no sign of low humidity on those fruits.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest putting the cakes into a saucer with some water and let them absorb it overnight.&amp;nbsp; You can also put a tablespoon of vermiculite on top of the cake and soak that, so water soaks in from both directions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10087548</next>\n<prev>10086446</prev>\n<first>10086446</first>\n<last>16360185</last>\n<when>1238608160</when>\n<utime>04/01/09 08:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
