Are you sure it's not just the verm on top that isn't colonized?  Sometimes a bit of the verm barrier drops down the side and doesn't colonize.  I'd wait one more week, and then birth, wash well under the faucet, and give each cake a good sniff.  If they smell like fresh mushrooms, roll in dry verm per the dunk and roll tek, and place in fruiting conditions.<br />RR"}}
