You should have three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite in the bottom.  This will give you 99% humidity.  I'd leave the lid open at least 10% for air exchange.  The perlite will still provide plenty of humidity, and the lid open will allow the air exchange you need.   You'll still want to fan it out a time or two per day. NEVER seal a fruiting chamber.  That's a recipe for molds and aborts. Good luck.<br />RR"}}
