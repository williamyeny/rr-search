Agar is for cloning and isolation away from contaminants, because you have the flat, two dimensional plane of a petri dish to work with.  You can't isolate anything in the three dimensional space of lc.  In fact, I think lc's are a horrible way to expand tissue.  They're far slower than grains and you have no idea if you have healthy mycelium or contaminants until you grow them out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betadine is fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7027758</next>\n<prev>7025996</prev>\n<first>7023338</first>\n<last>7027950</last>\n<when>1181407202</when>\n<utime>06/09/07 07:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
