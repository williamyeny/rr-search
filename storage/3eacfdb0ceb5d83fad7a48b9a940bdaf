With proper air exchange and circulation, as well as a properly limed casing layer, they won't be able to germinate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6093718</next>\n<prev>6091284</prev>\n<first>6091267</first>\n<last>6093718</last>\n<when>1158975552</when>\n<utime>09/23/06 04:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
