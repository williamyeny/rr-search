And if you are using them to put in your sub then u dont need to dry them. and yes you should simmer them or pasturize them with the rest of your sub or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to store spent coffee grinds, always dry them first, or freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium loves an acidic pH of around 5, so don't use lime or oyster shells.&amp;nbsp; In the early days, there was a lot of horrible information spreading around, and that's why there's still bad advice in the archives about liming substrates.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are fungi, and mushroom mycelium is fungi.&amp;nbsp; Both love an acidic pH.&amp;nbsp; If you try to buffer to stop molds in a substrate, you also weaken the mushroom mycelium, and molds grow much faster.&amp;nbsp; It's like going into a gunfight with an unloaded gun.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14106075</next>\n<prev>14102410</prev>\n<first>14102067</first>\n<last>14106478</last>\n<when>1299843585</when>\n<utime>03/11/11 01:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
