This prevents sticking, and the metal to glass seal is all you need, provided you have a hole for gas exchange.  The air will follow the path of least resistance, which is through the filter, provided it's not too tight. . .I wouldn't worry about it if the jars don't stall.  If they do, you could try punching another hole by wrapping an alcohol soaked cloth tightly around the screwdriver(flame sterilized), then immediately covering that hole with micropore medical tape.  Be sure to do this in a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6613620</next>\n<prev>6613480</prev>\n<first>6613451</first>\n<last>6614228</last>\n<when>1172538434</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 03:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
