Not only is it a violation of the electrical codes, but a fire hazard too.  Motor speed with AC motors is determined by the frequency, which is 60 Hz in the US.  Lighting dimmers work by limiting the current the light bulb receives.  They are not compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You control motor speed with a motor speed controller.  They're built different, but not much more expensive.  However, you'll want that 1/20 horsepower motor running full speed anyway so just wire it to the cord direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 465 cfm figure is almost certainly based on zero static pressure.  I have a 12 X 24 flow hood and it uses a 1/15 hp motor.  Hopefully, you'll have enough flow, but definitely won't have too much.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6507414</next>\n<prev>6506725</prev>\n<first>6506343</first>\n<last>6839481</last>\n<when>1170062559</when>\n<utime>01/29/07 11:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
