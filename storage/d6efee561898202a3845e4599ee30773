I PC for 30 mins, usually more. I run my flowhood for a few hours before pouring, then pour, leave them uncovered, and place tops on them after they cool (i hate condensation on my petris tops). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your problem; bad technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always put the lids on the petri dishes immediately after pouring.&amp;nbsp; Never have a dish open for more than 5 seconds.&amp;nbsp; There will be no condensation by the next day if you stack all the dishes into a single stack after pouring as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Agar-Petri-Dishes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;agar-petri dish video.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No flow hood is 100% perfect.&amp;nbsp; With up to a few hundred cubic feet per minute, each cubic foot of air having tens of thousands of contaminant particles/spores @ 99.99% efficiency, think of how many contaminants are being blown through the hood and into your dishes as they sit open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blake_Shroom said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea, I know about that mold. It's wierd, growing under the agar on the bottom of the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is from exposure with the lids off prior to pouring, allowing contaminants to settle on the empty petri dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, most of what I see above appears to simply be undissolved solids from your nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18911214</next>\n<prev>18911153</prev>\n<first>18911055</first>\n<last>18911456</last>\n<when>1380567031</when>\n<utime>09/30/13 09:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
