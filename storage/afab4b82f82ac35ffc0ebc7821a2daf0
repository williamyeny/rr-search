The reason is that grains require sterilization, and manure does best with pasteurization.  They also each have different moisture requirements and different gas/air exchange requirements, so mixing them uncolonized is not recommended.  Follow the advice agar gave above if you want to succeed.  Nobody wants to help you fail.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6731666</next>\n<prev>6731659</prev>\n<first>6730475</first>\n<last>6732044</last>\n<when>1175366128</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 09:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
