It would take at least 10 Prestos to weigh as much as one AA of similar capacity. The chinese model is a sandwich wrapper compared to the AA, which is a battle-tested combat tank.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8967457</next>\n<prev>8967341</prev>\n<first>8964962</first>\n<last>8972765</last>\n<when>1222097783</when>\n<utime>09/22/08 06:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
