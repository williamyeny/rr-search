You can go ahead and put the casing layer on now.  The mycelium will be consolidating its hold on the substrate as it also colonizes the casing layer.  There's nothing wrong with using a very high spawn ratio, but you could have gotten more bang for your buck by using more coir/coffee and making two trays with those grains rather than just one.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
