Leave the lid loose if necessary for constant fresh air.  Make sure you're not heating the fruiting chamber or that will produce excess condensation as well.  You want three to four inches of perlite, not 1 1/2.  Good luck and welcome.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6788719</next>\n<prev>6788218</prev>\n<first>6788218</first>\n<last>6789274</last>\n<when>1176600902</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 04:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
