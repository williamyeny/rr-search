Just transfer a piece of mycelium from the petri dish no larger than a grain of rice to the test tube slant.  Allow to grow out for a week, then refrigerate.<br />I always sterilize the agar in the slants, then lay them at an angle to cool.  Transferring the agar to the slants later adds an additional vector for contamination to enter.<br />To avoid condensation, allow the agar to cool almost to room temperature before pouring or using.  I pour dishes with the agar at about 100F.  This almost completely stops condensation from forming.  If you'll use the test tubes with screw on lids, you can put the agar in them and screw down the lid tight for the PC cycle.  This way, you're sure the contents are sterile when you open the lid because there will be a bit of vacuum on it and you'll hear a hiss.<br />RR"}}
