Every place carries Ball jars, but the half pint wide mouths are Kerr brand, which is stupid because Ball actually owns Kerr now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember the last time I went into a neighborhood grocery store and didn't find 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars on the shelf. Gosh, the nearest town to me only has 600 people and the only grocery store in town has 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars, as does the local hardware store(not Ace). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You guys need to boycott walmart and other big-box stores and shop at stores which aren't actively trying to destroy our way of life.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16242159</next>\n<prev>16242055</prev>\n<first>16237838</first>\n<last>16242290</last>\n<when>1337218892</when>\n<utime>05/17/12 04:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
