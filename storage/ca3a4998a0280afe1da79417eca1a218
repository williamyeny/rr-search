You can't do that with pins and small ones on it, can you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear dunking for a long length of time, ie ~24 hours, is really good for getting additional flushes, or growths, but then I hear you shouldn't pick shrooms one by one. So how to do both exactly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before dunking harvest the pins and dunk your nekkid cakes, roll after, as you would normally. Flush away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't pick the pins off before soaking!&amp;nbsp; Don't re-roll after first flush!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't begin to count the number of times I've typed that and given a detailed explanation for why on both.&amp;nbsp; This is why we recommend using the search posts feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That just ruins your next flush.&amp;nbsp; You can dunk with pins, so you only harvest the ones that are ready by slicing off at the base with a sharp knife so you don't damage nearby pins which are waiting for their chance to grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19948453</next>\n<prev>19948434</prev>\n<first>19948366</first>\n<last>19957945</last>\n<when>1399384573</when>\n<utime>05/06/14 04:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
