Rinse before the soak, not after. Once you've soaked in water or weak coffee, bring the soak water to a boil with the rye in it.  It's all described in the tek posted above, and also on the video. I've used coffee grinds in grains, but there's little benefit.  It's better as a substrate ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7017098</prev>\n<first>7014591</first>\n<last>7017529</last>\n<when>1181191727</when>\n<utime>06/07/07 07:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
