Even the red spored strains show up occasionally regardless of the 'name' on the strain.  Certain exceptions exist such as albinos, but remember, every strain out there will throw an albino once in a while.  Clone it and you have an albino strain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6243021</next>\n<prev>6243000</prev>\n<first>6238759</first>\n<last>6243307</last>\n<when>1162574174</when>\n<utime>11/03/06 07:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
