It will only weaken the mushroom mycelium.  Penicillium will colonize brf or grains much easier than manure or compost.<br />Penicillium spores are so small, they will also travel right through filters, so there's a good chance you'll lose some more jars.  Using an 'incubator' compounded the problem by holding them all together in a closed space.<br />If you removed the jars before the mold got to the top, you might be OK.<br />RR"}}
