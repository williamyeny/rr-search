You got any idea of the spacing at 15 psi?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the foil isn't to protect from steam.&amp;nbsp; It's to protect from water drops that rain down from the lid of the pressure cooker during sterilization.&amp;nbsp; All filtered jars should be covered with foil during sterilization.&amp;nbsp; The foil can be reused dozens of times until it disintegrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14323243</next>\n<prev>14322995</prev>\n<first>14320905</first>\n<last>14357223</last>\n<when>1303329758</when>\n<utime>04/20/11 11:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
