{"key":"post-3026672","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3026672</id>\n<content>I've found a much better way since I wrote that tek for straw logs.  For $49 you can get a weed eater.  Put your straw in a trash can, rubbermaid, or whatever you have.  Poke a hole in the lid just big enough for the weed eater to slide through.  You can chop up enough straw for a 48&quot; log in ten minutes.  Easiest way I've found yet.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3026716</next>\n<prev>3023771</prev>\n<first>3021934</first>\n<last>3031600</last>\n<when>1092982172</when>\n<utime>08/20/04 09:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
