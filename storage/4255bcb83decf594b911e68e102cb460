Water is a much better conductor of heat than air, thus water or steam pasteurization the preferred method.  Water or steam will conduct heat into the substrate fastest, thus allowing you to more precisely control the total amount of time at pasteurization temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use zip-loc bags in hot water too.  They work very well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7795241</next>\n<prev>7795039</prev>\n<first>7793239</first>\n<last>7804904</last>\n<when>1198515227</when>\n<utime>12/24/07 06:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
