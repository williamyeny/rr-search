If your humidity is already high, the wax paper is overkill.  I use it in a greenhouse, where I keep the humidity to 80% to prevent water droplets forming and dripping on everything.  The wax paper helps to make up the difference.   If a drop of water does fall from above, the wax paper keeps it from hitting the developing primordia or pins.  Be sure to change it out every couple of days for a fresh sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in my post above, I should have said I 'rarely' use a casing with horse manure.  Sometimes I do, and with certain species such as copelandia, a casing layer is mandatory, wax paper or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5506881</next>\n<prev>5506644</prev>\n<first>4887823</first>\n<last>5506881</last>\n<when>1144847352</when>\n<utime>04/12/06 04:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
