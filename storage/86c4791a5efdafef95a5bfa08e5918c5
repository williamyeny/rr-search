Mine has slits cut from top to bottom all over it for fresh air exchange. Massive air exchange is the key to avoiding contaminants in the fruiting environments.  Another tip is that hundreds of growers here have learned the hard way that modifying the output on your vicks coolmist will drastically shorten the lifespan.  If you want to pump humidity into your greenhouse, try to find a large hose, such as 4\" dryer vent hose, or the large swimming pool hose, and slip that over the output so you don't restrict the flow, causing static pressure inside the unit, which will ruin the motor bushings. <br />Do you know the color temperature in Kelvin for that EL wire?  You want bright, high frequency lighting for best results as well.  Look for something in the 5500K to 7000K range.<br />Thanks for posting.<br />RR"}}
