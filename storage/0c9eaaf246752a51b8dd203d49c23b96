I see no real benefit for home growers because the mycelium can only make so many cell divisions before senescence, so you just cut out a grain transfer and do a manure transfer which is more prone to contamination.  It's already a race to colonize bulk projects before mold sets in, so when you manure to manure transfer, you double the exposure.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the grain is a substantial part of the substrate, so when you do a manure to manure transfer, you half the amount of grain in each.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6387022</prev>\n<first>6386927</first>\n<last>6387381</last>\n<when>1166573411</when>\n<utime>12/20/06 02:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
