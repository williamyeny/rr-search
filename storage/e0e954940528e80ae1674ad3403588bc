High temp RTV is for engine repairs and gaskets, and should be cured around 400F. I seal exhaust leaks on my old Harleys and trucks with high temp RTV as an example.&amp;nbsp; For your use, regular silicone caulk is what you want and it's rated up to over 300F, well above pressure cooker temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, metal lids are vastly superior.&amp;nbsp; When they rust, use a green scouring pad to clean them.&amp;nbsp; When they get too rusty and worn out, replace.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17091332</next>\n<prev>17091192</prev>\n<first>17090500</first>\n<last>17093718</last>\n<when>1351092922</when>\n<utime>10/24/12 06:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
