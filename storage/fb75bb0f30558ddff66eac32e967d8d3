You really can't dig out trichoderma because the mycelium is white and usually mixed throughout the substrate when it appears shortly after spawing.  All you did was dig out the spores, which spread a few billion of them into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you spawn to coir, the need for sterility is over.  In fact, the coir should be pasteurized rather than sterilized, so actually, once you get your pf jars incoulated, you don't need to be totally sterilie anymore, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mentioned an incubator.  Bulk substrates produce a lot of heat so if you have them in an incubator, they're probably overheating in the core, which stimulates thermophilic molds.  Use room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6264886</next>\n<prev>6263665</prev>\n<first>6262584</first>\n<last>6268585</last>\n<when>1163051667</when>\n<utime>11/09/06 07:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
