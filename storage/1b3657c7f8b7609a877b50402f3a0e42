Plant food won't do squat for mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms don't 'uptake' as you suspect because they don't have a vascular system like plants. Food is digested at the cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using plant food on grains probably won't ruin the batch, but it won't do any good either.&amp;nbsp; Grains are already nearly too rich in nutrients, and this is the reason they must be sterilized.&amp;nbsp; Grains are also the reason we consolidate a substrate.&amp;nbsp; They're so rich that blobs and mutants generally develop if we fail to do so.&amp;nbsp; Any plant food in the grains would have been long since metabolized by fruiting time. We also know that excess nutrients slows down colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18407099</next>\n<prev>18405162</prev>\n<first>18135103</first>\n<last>27005031</last>\n<when>1371008081</when>\n<utime>06/12/13 06:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
