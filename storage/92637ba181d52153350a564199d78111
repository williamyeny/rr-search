{"key":"post-6578135","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6578135</id>\n<content>I use 1/2&quot; of water when cooking sawdust/wood substrate bags for 2 hours, and no more than half of it is lost during the process.  The key is to turn down the stove as soon as pressure is reached to the very &lt;i&gt;minimum setting that will maintain pressure&lt;/i&gt;.  Don't let the weight rattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a shelf of some kind to keep the jars out of the water.  With 1/2 pints, I don't let them even touch the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6578173</next>\n<prev>6578130</prev>\n<first>6578015</first>\n<last>6579456</last>\n<when>1171740672</when>\n<utime>02/17/07 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
