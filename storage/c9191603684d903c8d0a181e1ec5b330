Air gets stale in a small tupperware container too fast.  You can pour some water to the substrate and let it sit overnight and then pour out the excess the next morning.  Leave the lid loose for air exchange between fannings, and get some more water to them.  Just a fyi, popcorn is the worst possible choice of grain for spawn.  It works, but not nearly as well as the traditional choices of rye berries or wbs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6859395</prev>\n<first>6857596</first>\n<last>6859578</last>\n<when>1178067652</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
