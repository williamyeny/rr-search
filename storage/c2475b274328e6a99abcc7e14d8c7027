The specific mushroom in this picture had a large puffy base as well, that made it difficult to harvest, it was really on the cake and had to basically be ripped off. After it was dried I wasn't really wanting to eat the puffy base so I snipped it with scissors. </blockquote><br />Next time, snip off the base before picking so you don't destroy the cake/substrate by tearing the mushroom out.&nbsp; You're supposed to harvest by slicing the mushrooms off with a sharp knife, not ripping them out.<br />RR"}}
