You can grow on 100% coir, or you can grow on 100% coffee grinds, so mix them anyway you feel like it.  Both are acidic, but mushrooms love an acidic substrate.  However, molds also like an acidic substrate, so that's the only reason we use hydrated lime, calcium carbonate, oyster shell flour, etc.  By adding those, we make the substrate less hospitable to molds, while the mushroom mycelium is more tolerant of a high pH.  Adjust the lime so you're substrate starting point is around 7.5 pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use gypsum at up to 10% of the substrate to add calcium and sulfur, both essential mushroom nutrients lacking in most substrates, including coir and coffee.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6688549</next>\n<prev>6686990</prev>\n<first>6686899</first>\n<last>6691844</last>\n<when>1174332555</when>\n<utime>03/19/07 10:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
