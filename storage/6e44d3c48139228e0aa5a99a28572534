Next time, toss out substrates that mold.  The spores that are released make future grows a thousand times more likely to contaminate, ruining your future crops.  It's not worth saving them.  You can plant the contaminated substrate outdoors in a shady spot with some bagged cow manure and they usually recover and grow there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6827140</next>\n<prev>6827129</prev>\n<first>6827129</first>\n<last>6827140</last>\n<when>1177435867</when>\n<utime>04/24/07 08:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
