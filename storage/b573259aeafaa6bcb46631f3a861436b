Obviously doc, you have the experience and knowledge to read your surface mycelium in order to know just when to initiate pinning.  A few years ago, coir was widely used in casings, and many growers such as Roadkill, had and still have, great results with it.  Most of us mixed it 60/40 verm-coir.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with new growers using coir as a top layer is that if they don't yet know how to time initiation, it's very prone to overlay, just as any non-cased bulk substrate will be.  I've grown on pure coir, as have many growers here and it works great.  I'm sure putting it over straw gives the benefits of the coir, while also the massive water holding properties of straw, giving the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7858670</next>\n<prev>7858273</prev>\n<first>7853352</first>\n<last>7859158</last>\n<when>1199981942</when>\n<utime>01/10/08 06:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
