I'd stay away from popcorn as it's the worst possible choice for spawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplemented sawdust must be sterilized.  The wheat bran harbors bacterial endospores and must be pressure cooked.  If you fail to supplement the sawdust/woodchips, yields are greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to use jars or filter patch bags.  Jars are great for grain spawn, but bags are really the best practical choice for sawdust/chips.  I use the large, gusseted filter bags, and usually load them with around 17 to 20 cups of material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My woodlover recipe:  This fills two large spawn bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 cups hardwood sawdust&lt;br /&gt;2 cups wheat or rice bran.  (wheat bran is much more economical)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;15 cups moistened hardwood chips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix the dry ingredients together, then hydrate so the mixture sounds spongy when squeezed, but NO water comes out, even when you forcefully squeeze a handful.  If any water squeezes out, toss in another handful of dry sawdust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the above is prepared, mix with an equal amount by volume of moistened hardwood chips.  I soak the hardwood chips for 24 to 48 hours.  If soaking is not an option, boil them for one hour to hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Load the above into two large bags and sterilize for 90 minutes at 15 psi.  An AA 921 can hold four bags this size.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6462192</next>\n<prev>6458246</prev>\n<first>6458157</first>\n<last>6462347</last>\n<when>1168867972</when>\n<utime>01/15/07 03:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
