{"key":"post-16226500","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>16226500</id>\n<content>I didn't see a chart for the filter, but that blower should be about right since the 11 1/2&quot; thick filters seem to have less resistance than the thinner ones. Typically, a blower that size will only develop around .5&quot; W.G. or so against a thick filter, so if that's the case it will flow 450 fpm before derating. You want around 100+ fpm, but allow for surface resistance, turbulence in the plenum, and resistance caused by the prefilter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16226550</next>\n<prev>16226034</prev>\n<first>16226034</first>\n<last>16876080</last>\n<when>1336965001</when>\n<utime>05/14/12 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
