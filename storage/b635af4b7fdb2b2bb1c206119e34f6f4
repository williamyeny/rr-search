At least I advised against it within the last week or so.  I recommend to mix the manure into the soil, but not to build a box that will attract insects to the different food source than the native one, and in addition, will flood when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd remake it without the plywood box.  Drying out a bit is good.  It will encourage the mycelium to branch out more in search of food and water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7761254</next>\n<prev>7761235</prev>\n<first>7759923</first>\n<last>7761562</last>\n<when>1197735844</when>\n<utime>12/15/07 06:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
