{"key":"post-5011548","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5011548</id>\n<content>I think 'mycelial waste' is an incorrect description of metabolytes.  The term 'piss' is simply wrong.  It appears the metabolytes are produced in higher amounts when bacteria are present.  The metabolytes have been tested to have very powerful antibiotic and antimicrobial properties.  They seem to be the mycelium's defense mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why we see more metabolytes in old projects where bacteria has started to grow.  We also see it in projects incubated at too high a temperature, which also stimulates bacteria.  I just wanted to clear that up.  The metabolytes are not simply waste products.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5012362</next>\n<prev>5009691</prev>\n<first>5009606</first>\n<last>5012362</last>\n<when>1133663017</when>\n<utime>12/04/05 04:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
