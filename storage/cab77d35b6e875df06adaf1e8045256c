I advise against LC because you use all that time to grow it and then there is no way to tell if it's contaminated or not until you use it.  Theres much faster ways to expand mycelium than liquid culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium won't grow in a vacuum, so whatever you pulled out of your jar must be something else.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7761269</next>\n<prev>7758056</prev>\n<first>7758056</first>\n<last>7762188</last>\n<when>1197729709</when>\n<utime>12/15/07 04:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
