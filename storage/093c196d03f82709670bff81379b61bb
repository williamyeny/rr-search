Mushrooms grow by cell division.&amp;nbsp; Obviously there's some engorgement with water too, but primordia do not have all the cells a mature mushroom will have.&amp;nbsp; Whoever first pulled that bullshit out of his ass should be tarred and feathered because for some unknown reason, people keep repeating it. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher spawn ratios only help speed colonization minimally. Once the mycelium gets going, it will generally double in size every day.&amp;nbsp; This means that after a week or so, the difference in colonization between a high and low spawn rate isn't much, assuming of course proper pasteurization and no contamination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growers should experiment with high and low spawn rates for each strain they grow.&amp;nbsp; Some prefer a more nutritious substrate than others, so these can benefit from a higher spawn rate.&amp;nbsp; Strains which prefer a lower nutrient level will often grow mutants and blobs instead of mushrooms on the first flush as the mycelium consumes the excess grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20266075</next>\n<prev>20265792</prev>\n<first>20264331</first>\n<last>20268010</last>\n<when>1405263458</when>\n<utime>07/13/14 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
