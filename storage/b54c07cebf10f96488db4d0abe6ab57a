Just take a rubbermaid container, fill it with ten gallons of hot water (160F), add 1/3 cup of lime, and drop your straw in for one hour.   Put a screen and a weight on top to keep it submerged.   After the hour is up, put it in another rubbermaid container on a screen to drain.  After it's drained and cooled, just spawn it with rye graiin or corn, and in 21 days you'll pick lots of shrooms.
