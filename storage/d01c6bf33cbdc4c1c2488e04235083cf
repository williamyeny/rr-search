What did i do wrong so far? I made a 2:1:1 BRF cake, filled each jar equally, wiped the lip with paper towel, put the dry verm layer to fill the jar the rest of the way, cover (rubber side up), put micropore tape on the innoc holes, cover with tinfoil, put jar lids on the bottom of the pot, then piece of tin foil, then another set of jar lids, filled with water (under the top of second lids) put jars in and stacked, then boiled the water. &lt;b&gt;once it came to a boil i started the timer,&lt;/b&gt; kept it on for 100 minutes+, checked ever 20-30 min making sure it didnt boil dry, once done took it off and let it sit, checked this morning, it all look good (AND NO CRACKED JAR, &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;). Isnt that all right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video says to start the timer when steam first escapes from the under the lid, and then turn stove to the lowest setting which will keep a small amount of steam escaping. When the water boils is irrelevant, since it might take half an hour or more after boiling before the jars are heated up enough to allow steam to escape under the lid.&amp;nbsp; Until that time, the steam hits the jars, condenses back to water and drips back down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15340362</next>\n<prev>15340241</prev>\n<first>15339012</first>\n<last>18974348</last>\n<when>1320776549</when>\n<utime>11/08/11 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
