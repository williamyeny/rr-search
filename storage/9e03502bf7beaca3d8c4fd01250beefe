If you mix it strong enough to suppress bacteria, it also suppresses mushroom mycelium, and the whole point of agar work is to encourage the mushroom mycelium to grow as fast as possible so you can get it to outrun contaminants and obtain a clean culture. Gentmycin sulphate makes a great antibiotic because it's autoclavable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fail to understand the point of the brf/crisco/karo stuff, even &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you could get something to grow on it.  The purpose of agar is so the mycelium grows on the flat surface of the plate so that you can see the entire organism.  BRF is going to support three dimensional growth, so you may as well use pf jars or whatever.  Agar is easy to obtain and use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7600192</next>\n<prev>7599932</prev>\n<first>7599497</first>\n<last>7638674</last>\n<when>1194317374</when>\n<utime>11/06/07 04:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
