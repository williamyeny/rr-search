Adjust so a cigarette lighter held in the work area will have the flame bent from 45 to 90 degrees without flickering or blowing out.  You can also get a motor speed controller.  They're less than $100 for a motor that size.  A piece of metal or even cardboard over the intake is much cheaper.<br />RR"}}
