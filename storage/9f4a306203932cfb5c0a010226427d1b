I had to stop growing Hypsizygus ulmarius, the elm oyster due to horrible allergic reactions to the spores.  I only grew them perhaps three or four crops before I couldn't even walk into the house without my lungs seizing up to the point I couldn't breathe, and I don't normally have allergies to anything.  I couldn't even harvest them.  I had to go to a hotel for a few days and sent mrs rabbit to clear out every single elm oyster substrate from my grow area and get rid of them.  I had her start my laminar flow hood, and she left it running for three days before I could enter the house, then we had to shampoo/steam clean the carpets and everything.  So far, that's the only species that has done that to me, fortunately.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6772604</next>\n<prev>6772539</prev>\n<first>6769177</first>\n<last>6773360</last>\n<when>1176262132</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
