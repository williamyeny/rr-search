Store bought composted cow manure can grow some real monsters, but you either need to cut it with coir as said above, or cut it about 25% or more with vermiculite, or it can turn to mud.  Mixing cow manure, horse manure, coffee grinds, coir, compost, worm castings, etc., is great.  The more the merrier.<br />One thing also about cow manure from the nursery, sometimes it comes from feed lots and is heavily saturated with urea.  If it stinks of urine or ammonia, be sure to lay it out on a tarp in the sun for a few days so all the ammonia smell can flash off.  Once the ammonia smell is gone, it's good to use.  Hydrate to field capacity and pasteurize.  All bulk substrates benefit from the addition of 5% to 10% by volume of gypsum.<br />RR"}}
