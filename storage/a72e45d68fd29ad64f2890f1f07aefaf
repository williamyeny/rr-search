There's no rot or mold.&nbsp; They even survived all last winter under the snow, thawing out and fruiting again this year, old stumps and all.<br />If a cake starts to dry out mid flush, you can set it in a saucer of water overnight to allow the cake to soak up the water.&nbsp; You can also pile up some verm on top of the cake and soak that. Or both.<br />RR"}}
