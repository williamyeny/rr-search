I also had it filmed with coffee, but cut that one out.  I wanted as much as I could get on the video in the four hours I had available, and the ten minutes I explained how to use coffee without screwing up the grow, meant something else like agar work or sawdust/woodchips had to go.  Coffee definitely is a boost to grain spawn.<br />As for the cost, it's the cheapest on the market.  Fmrc's 80 minute vhs video is $85, and the only other one is that lame 'mushroom growing made easy' that's got bootleg versions on Youtube, and it's $36 for an hour and ten minutes to get a legal copy.  Mine is $39 for four hours.<br />I bought the music.  I have over 50 DVD's of music that I've paid royalties on.<br />RR"}}
