This has been attempted dozens, if not hundreds of times.  Adding tryptamine, DMT, etc., to the substrate does not effect potency.  Gartz's experiments to the best of my knowledge have NEVER been duplicated, even by himself.  I suspect he jumped the gun in publishing his study, which stamets picked up and repeated, thus the myth lives on.  <br />I also tried numerous times to duplicate the process, with absolutely no gain in potency.  This exact thing was just in a thread yesterday, by the way.<br />RR"}}
