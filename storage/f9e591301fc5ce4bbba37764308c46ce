The casing layer MUST begin to dry out between misting, or mycelium won't pin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, with hoses, your tiny fans in the Kaz will be trying to develop static pressure, which will fry the bearings in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9784660</next>\n<prev>9784505</prev>\n<first>9783580</first>\n<last>9784660</last>\n<when>1234464953</when>\n<utime>02/12/09 08:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
