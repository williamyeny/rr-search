I counted over 70 pins on one cake. Some aborted but on my first flush I was averaging around 40 mature fruits. The problem is that they were so small. One cake, that produced 40+ fruits, weighed a total of 3 dry grams (avg .07 each). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is strain related as already said.&amp;nbsp; If you had used a different tek such as a manure or straw bulk substrate, you'd have had thousands of pins and most would still have aborted since a given area of mycelium can only support a given number of fruits to full size.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could probably use that same syringe again and not get the same genetics since every grow from spores is different.&amp;nbsp; Experienced and commercial growers isolate strains to find one with the pinning performance to cover a bulk substrate at about the rate they can fill in a nice canopy without crowding each other out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>18920066</prev>\n<first>18919928</first>\n<last>18920108</last>\n<when>1380727268</when>\n<utime>10/02/13 06:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
