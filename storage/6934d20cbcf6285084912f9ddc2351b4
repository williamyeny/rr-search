If you have 30 count peroxide such as it is measured in Europe, it is at ten percent.  If you dilute it three to one, you have 3.33% peroxide.   If you purchase it at a drug or grocery store in the US, it comes in 3% concentration.  If you dilute it ten to one, you have roughly .3% after mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said above, peroxide is toxic to mycelium, all mycelium, therefore it is hated by mushrooms and mold alike.  If you have an outbreak of Dactylium, you can spray the casing layer with it to wipe out the cobweb.  This doesn't hurt the mushroom mycelium because Dactylium rarely colonizes over the top of mushroom colonized casing layers.   I've found it's a mistake to use as a preventative measure because it sets the mushroom mycelium back and makes it less aggressive, then the faster recovering molds get the upper hand.  Sterile technique will prevent molds in spawn, and fresh air exchange will prevent most molds in the growing environment, so go with that for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6712806</next>\n<prev>6703667</prev>\n<first>6703342</first>\n<last>6712806</last>\n<when>1174699823</when>\n<utime>03/24/07 04:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
