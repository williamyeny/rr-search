Three days from inoculation is a bit too early to see much mushroom mycelial growth.  This is about when the spores should start germinating.  If any jars are 'very far' along, it's almost a sure bet it's contaminants you're seeing and not mushroom mycelium.  It sounds like you didn't get the brf sterilized.
