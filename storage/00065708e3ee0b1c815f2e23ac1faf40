{"key":"post-6307146","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6307146</id>\n<content>Coffee and coir are both substrate materials and perform poorly in casings.  Coffee is especially prone to contamination when used in casing.  It should be part of the substrate mix so it can be fully colonized, therefore resistant to molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, temperature drop has nothing to do with pinning in cubensis.  In fact, I've colonized jars and bulk substrates at room temperature, then fruited at 90F with excellent results. The other factors you mention are the key pinning triggers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get better yields with a proper peat/verm casing layer, but if your coir/coffee fully colonizes, I'd suggest just fruiting it as is, uncased.  This will get you a harvest sooner, and you can perfect your techniques on future grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6307115</prev>\n<first>6307115</first>\n<last>6307146</last>\n<when>1164731987</when>\n<utime>11/28/06 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
