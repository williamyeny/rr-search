{"key":"post-6809744","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6809744</id>\n<content>I used to use a scalpel, but realized why germination was so poor when I used a scalpel to scrape some spores onto a microscope slide for observation.  The scalpel cut them to shreds, and about 3/4 of them were ripped open. I have the picture I took of those spores somewhere on one of my archived hard drives.  I'll try to find it one of these days. That's why something with a rounded edge such as wire is preferred over anything sharp.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>25617547</next>\n<prev>6809720</prev>\n<first>6807291</first>\n<last>25617633</last>\n<when>1177027353</when>\n<utime>04/20/07 03:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
