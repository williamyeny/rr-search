You'd never superheat nasty water. In addition, microwaves are generally the filthiest appliance in a kitchen, which is the filthiest room in any house.&nbsp; <br />Give your experiment a go, but personally I see nothing good to come of it.&nbsp; About all that's in the soak/boil water is fermented malts, and most likely quite a few endospores that survived the boiling.&nbsp; I don't see anything being added to the substrate that wouldn't be added when you spawn the rye grain to it.<br />RR"}}
