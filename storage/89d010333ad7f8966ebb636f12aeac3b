Dumping a ton of spores into a jar will make the whole jar turn white sooner, but that's not always better.  Some strains are not capable of anastomosis, so you end up with two or three of the (sub)strains fruiting from only a partial substrate.  This results in poor performance.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5738718</prev>\n<first>5738547</first>\n<last>5738766</last>\n<when>1150067267</when>\n<utime>06/12/06 02:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
