The only reason for keeping a bulk substrate, and especially the casing layer dark during colonization is for the timing of the pinset initiation.  It allows you to introduce all the major pinning triggers simultaneously, resulting in an explosion of pins.  A bulk substrate will colonize just fine if exposed to light from day one, but then you aren't maximizing potential by synchronizing the pinning triggers.<br />RR"}}
