I've found that brand new fresh spores that are only a few days old, will only germinate about 1 or 2 out of 100.   By one year, it's 1 or 2 spores out of 1,000 and it continues to decline from there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6843389</next>\n<prev>6842385</prev>\n<first>6841710</first>\n<last>6887886</last>\n<when>1177730397</when>\n<utime>04/28/07 06:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
