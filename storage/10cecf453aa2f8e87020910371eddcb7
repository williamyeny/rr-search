It seems counter-intuitive that a mushroom would have more than one set of genes....unless it has &quot;down-syndrome&quot; I'd agree that the genotype wouldn't necissarily match the phenotype, but that doesn't make it NOT an isolate &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/popcorn.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:popcorn:&quot; title=&quot;:popcorn:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Counter-intuitive or not, it's been shown over and over again that fruiting bodies can have dozens or even hundreds of strains and even species active in them.&amp;nbsp; There's been many threads on it and it was even known back when Stamets wrote GGMM, because he covered it there and also in Mycelium Running.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15482309</next>\n<prev>15479565</prev>\n<first>15477729</first>\n<last>15485875</last>\n<when>1323281338</when>\n<utime>12/07/11 08:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
