It's a cheapie <i>stereo zoom microscope</i>  It's the type that has the light and the objective on the same side.  It's for veiwing the tops of petri dishes or looking at sporeprints.  A <i>compound microscope</i> is what you need for observing mycelium as it grows, and for looking for clamp connections.  A compound microscope has the light and the objective on opposite sides of the object you're viewing.  The light shines through the target and you see a transparancy of of your mycelium or spores.  Do a few searches using 'stereo zoom microsope' and 'compound microscope' and look for something in your price range.  The first picture below is of mycelium excreting metabolytes, taken with the $175 zoom microscope using a mini-div camera inserted in place of one of the eye tubes.   The second picture is of a single spore.  You can clearly see the internal components of the cell.  That picture was taken with a much more expensive medical grade trinocular compound microscope at 1000X with a 2 megapixel CCTV camera attached to the camera tube.  They're two totally different microscopes used for two different purposes.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380079-Metabolite_4.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380079-thumb_Metabolite_4.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/166572703-GT_1000X.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/05-12/166572703-thumb_GT_1000X.jpg\"></a><br />RR"}}
