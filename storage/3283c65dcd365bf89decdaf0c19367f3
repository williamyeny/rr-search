{"key":"post-15327933","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>15327933</id>\n<content>I've been trying to get the whole archives deleted for years.&amp;nbsp; It's full of bad advice written by noobs who certainly had good intentions, back when the site was new and there were no experienced growers giving help.&amp;nbsp; They tried something and it worked, thus they promoted it, often in 'teks' they named after themselves, &lt;i&gt;PF tek&lt;/i&gt; being a prime example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, we've learned much more and there's lots of far more experienced people, and that old stuff needs to be ignored or deleted.&amp;nbsp; I don't have time to do it, but every &lt;i&gt;trusted cultivator&lt;/i&gt; has 'moderator access' just like I do to edit/delete anything in there.
