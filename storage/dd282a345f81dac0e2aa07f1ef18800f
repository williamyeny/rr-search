{"key":"post-7052291","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7052291</id>\n<content>I've grown at least ten species of wood decomposing mushrooms on brf.  It makes a great spawn.  Most will even fruit on it.  You can inoculate the brf with your culture or spores, and when fully colonized, transfer to supplemented hardwood sawdust/chips for fruiting or spawning to outdoor beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slight modification is to replace the vermiculite with an equal amount of hardwood sawdust, but otherwise keep the same brf recipe.  Colonization will be a bit slower than with verm, but you can then use it either as spawn to bulk, or as a fruiting substrate as a way of testing strain isolates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7052325</next>\n<prev>7052282</prev>\n<first>7052282</first>\n<last>7052325</last>\n<when>1182005829</when>\n<utime>06/16/07 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
