Don't case over 1/2&quot; thick unless your substrate is 4&quot; thick or more. Casing material should be pasteurized, not sterilized. I can think of no reason why you'd apply a casing layer and then stick it in the refrigerator.   Cold stops mycelium growth, and when fruiting a cased substrate you want to encourage mycelium growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rapidly growing grey mycelium is cobweb mold.  Hit it with peroxide straight from the bottle to disolve it on contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's probably too late to save this one, but next time, crumble your cakes into a tray, apply 1/2&quot; or less of pasteurized peat/verm casing, then cover with foil for a few days until mycelium pokes through the surface, then expose to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6326560</next>\n<prev>6326211</prev>\n<first>6325937</first>\n<last>6326921</last>\n<when>1165059613</when>\n<utime>12/02/06 01:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
