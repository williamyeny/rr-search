Dark syringes mean more spores in large clumps, which means not only more mycelial hyphae to have to combine later, but also more chances for contaminant spores to be in the mix.  Good syringes from reputable vendors will appear clear.  If you get a dark syringe, it was not made by an experienced vendor.  If yours came from one of the vendors here, use it.  They know what they're doing, bad advice above from someone with no experience in the matter notwithstanding.  You don't want a superdark syringe.  That's why none of the reputable, experienced vendors ship them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5878215</next>\n<prev>5878170</prev>\n<first>5873883</first>\n<last>5879714</last>\n<when>1153344356</when>\n<utime>07/20/06 12:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
