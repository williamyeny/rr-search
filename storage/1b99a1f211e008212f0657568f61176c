You can see metabolytes forming on the leading edge where the mushroom mycelium meets the mold.  The metabolytes are discharged in response to stress, and you can see them in that picture trying to attack the mold.<br />Anytime you see two distinct growths in a jar with a definite line separating the growths, at least one of them is the wrong stuff.  Metabolytes often form along that line of separation.  That jar needs to be tossed out.<br />RR"}}
