I see three or four growths that should go rhizo with a transfer or two.  Get plastic pre-sterilized petri dishes.  Glass is not suitable in my experience for mycology, since you can easily go through twenty or thirty dishes doing a single series of strain isolations.  It costs more to clean and re-sterilize glass dishes than what the plastic ones cost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7982174</next>\n<prev>7981724</prev>\n<first>7981650</first>\n<last>7984831</last>\n<when>1202233035</when>\n<utime>02/05/08 07:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
