Of course, I had a good teacher on how to make them up, as everyone will soon know. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\":wink:\"/><br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\"></a>"}}
