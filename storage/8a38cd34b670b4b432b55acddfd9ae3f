Cubes thrive in 100%.  If it smelled bad, it could easily be cobweb mold, which makes a fuzzy mycelium on the caps if it's allowed to spread that far.  If it's just a few spots of very white mycelium, it's probably from the species you're growing, since mushrooms are mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll move this to contamination forum.  You need to post pictures to get an accurate diagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7927549</next>\n<prev>7923012</prev>\n<first>7921496</first>\n<last>7927549</last>\n<when>1201182655</when>\n<utime>01/24/08 03:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
