Now that you have, don't add insult to injury to your mycelium by hitting the wound with peroxide.  Allow the mushroom mycelium to heal by recolonizing the cut part, then later on if cobweb develops, hit it with peroxide.<br />That said, if this was a pf jar, the top verm barrier often has a 'cobweb' appearance if the mycelium gets up into it.<br />RR"}}
