A lighting dimmer could control the heat, because a heating element is a resistive load like lights, but the fan, which is an inductive load, would have to bypass the dimmer.  The speed of an AC motor is determined by the frequency of the 50hz or 60hz power supply, not the current.  If you limit current on an AC motor, it still tries to run the same speed, smoking it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why connecting a motor to a lighting dimmer is a violation of the National Electrical Code.  That law was passed because too many people were connecting ceiling fans to dimmers instead of motor speed controllers, thus burning houses down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6584714</next>\n<prev>6584530</prev>\n<first>6583334</first>\n<last>6586827</last>\n<when>1171903319</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 06:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
