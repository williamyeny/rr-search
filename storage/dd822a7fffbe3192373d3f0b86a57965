Four to five days is when you can expect to first begin to see mushroom mycelial growth at all.  Coffee will not cause spores to fail to germinate.  Just make sure it's half drinking strength or less or molds will be favored.  I also have no experience with brf substrates and coffee.  All my coffee work was done with rye berries and popcorn, with rye berries showing much better results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4607851</next>\n<prev>4607057</prev>\n<first>4606605</first>\n<last>4607851</last>\n<when>1125571525</when>\n<utime>09/01/05 01:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
