People who have never actually tried straight verm saying all they know is it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it in a side by side with your 50/50+, then tell us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 4 years ago, I was the very first one to post that coir is a substrate material.  After a year of flames from people claiming that &quot;Coir has NO nutes&quot;, somebody else finally tried it, and then somebody else, and so on.  Experimenting is how we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain verm has been used as a casing layer hundreds, if not thousands of times.  I used it many times myself, but I've said this for years, and the results of many experiments still hold true; &lt;i&gt;Plain verm is a horrible choice for a casing layer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be really nice for a change to see someone actually experiment and then report the results, rather than endless posts about 'will this work?' or 'will that work?' and then arguing about it.  Just do it.  If you really want to experiment, try something that hasn't already been tried a thousand times.  Look in your kitchen, find something silly, and then grow mushrooms on it.  It's fun.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7834747</next>\n<prev>7834532</prev>\n<first>7832877</first>\n<last>12090397</last>\n<when>1199548035</when>\n<utime>01/05/08 05:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
