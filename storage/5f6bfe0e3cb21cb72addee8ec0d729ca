Thanks for your input. I made 96 jars. 12 have only the top layer of fine verm and 12 have everything as fine verm the rest are all coarse verm. I guess I've got a bit of an experiment on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine is preferred for the dry filter layer, so you should have used it for that on all the jars and your course for the mix.&amp;nbsp; However, fine verm works OK for all phases.&amp;nbsp; Next time, try to get one grade up from that one which will be slightly courser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure you noticed the fine verm soaked up more water than the course.&amp;nbsp; Those jars will probably colonize and fruit faster than the others.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17499304</next>\n<prev>17499191</prev>\n<first>17498732</first>\n<last>17499830</last>\n<when>1357358313</when>\n<utime>01/05/13 05:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
