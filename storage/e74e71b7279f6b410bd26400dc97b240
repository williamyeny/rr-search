I would imagine they will, but perhaps you have a local hobby shop that sells kite bulding supplies.  They might carry it in stock, or at least know what brand name it's sold under there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6714854</next>\n<prev>6714789</prev>\n<first>6714677</first>\n<last>6718128</last>\n<when>1174971106</when>\n<utime>03/27/07 07:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
