{"key":"post-5995469","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5995469</id>\n<content>I've noticed that before with certain strains/isolates.  One sub-strain I have of Redboy is especially prone to falling over just as they should be picked anyway.  If all else seemed normal, I'd say it's just strain related.  It's actually a good quality in my opinion, because when you pick the fruits, they come off the casing layer with little or no damage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5995522</next>\n<prev>5995454</prev>\n<first>5995251</first>\n<last>8586552</last>\n<when>1156521321</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 06:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
