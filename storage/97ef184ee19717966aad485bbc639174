With popcorn, the kernels are so large, there is not much surface area there to colonize, so the jars get done in a week to ten days.  Shake at initial inoculation, then don't shake again.   With rye, you will gain ground by shaking once at about 25 to 35 percent colonization.  I saw no such benefit with popcorn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5571539</next>\n<prev>5571264</prev>\n<first>5565314</first>\n<last>5571539</last>\n<when>1146356632</when>\n<utime>04/30/06 03:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
