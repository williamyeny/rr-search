It's no fun trying to glue filters to jar lids, especially when the filters that fit the rings are less expensive. In addition, the 70mm filters at .3 microns are 40 cents each, not over dollar as those are.&amp;nbsp; The contaminant spores that ruin our projects are all larger than .3 microns, so there's no need to filter smaller than that, and there might even be some restrictions in gas exchange with the tighter filter materials.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18618310</next>\n<prev>11594614</prev>\n<first>11594614</first>\n<last>18618310</last>\n<when>1260116563</when>\n<utime>12/06/09 06:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
