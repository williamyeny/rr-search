It damages the substrate which it will have to use energy to repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the substrate doesn't use energy to repair damage from improper picking.&amp;nbsp; The damaged area sits exposed until mold spores land and grow on it.&amp;nbsp; This is why you should only twist off mushrooms that are very loosely attached.&amp;nbsp; If a mushroom is firmly anchored to the substrate, cut off with a sharp knife, scissors, fishing line in a loop where you pull the ends to make the cut, etc.&amp;nbsp; There is no need to remove the stump and doing so leads to stalled fruiting and mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>26684015</next>\n<prev>17776328</prev>\n<first>17745082</first>\n<last>26684042</last>\n<when>1360535668</when>\n<utime>02/11/13 12:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
