Secondly, even colonized parts would be covered with fragments of the mold mycelium.  If they were growing together, which they were since the bag was sealed, the mold mycelium could be embedded with the mushroom mycelium and inseparable.  Third, he said he mixed the bag up after the contamination on top was peroxide sprayed.   That will mix any remaining molds throughout the grains.   Bags and jars should be tossed out as soon as contamination is found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His biggest mistake in my experience was overheating the substrate.  It might have colonized and fruited at room temperature.  Molds are stimulated by high temperatures, and mushroom mycelial growth falls off sharply when the substrate temperature exceeds 86F.  This is going to happen in an ambient temperature from the high seventies to low eighties.  Growers should not allow their colonizing bags or jars to exceed this range.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6174275</next>\n<prev>6169677</prev>\n<first>6168970</first>\n<last>7306962</last>\n<when>1160873115</when>\n<utime>10/15/06 03:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
