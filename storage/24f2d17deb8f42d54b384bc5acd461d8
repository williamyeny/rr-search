It usually takes two or three transfers to begin to see rhizomorphic growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd transfer a tiny piece from each sector to new dishes.  I usually make the first transfers as soon as the spores begin to germinate, when the total growth is the size of a dime or less.  Repeat the process a few times.  Don't try to isolate 'one' rhizomorphic growth.  Instead, isolate as many as you can, and then fruit each one.  Once you determine the best isolate, you can store it in master culture slants to use for years to come without degradation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7422258</prev>\n<first>7420047</first>\n<last>7422590</last>\n<when>1190121005</when>\n<utime>09/18/07 04:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
