Put your fruiting chamber in a small room and try to keep that room around 70F.  They'll fruit at lower temps, but performance is poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there's confusion because I've stated that cubensis will fruit outdoors when temps are in the 40's and 50's, which they will.  However, on sunny days even when cold, the soil heats up nicely from the sun.  You don't have that benefit indoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7838352</next>\n<prev>7838217</prev>\n<first>7834867</first>\n<last>7838352</last>\n<when>1199622096</when>\n<utime>01/06/08 02:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
