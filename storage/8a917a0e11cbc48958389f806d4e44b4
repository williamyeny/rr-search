I do mean a 3% solution of peroxide.  That's the strength it comes from the store in the US, so use it full strength.  In other countries it comes in 10%, in which case, they would need to dilute it a bit over 3 to 1 to get the same 3%.  Hydroponic stores sell it in 30%, in which case you'd dilute it 10 to 1 before using.<br />RR"}}
