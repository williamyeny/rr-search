Every tried this and any luck doing so? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Automated systems suck for growing mushrooms in small containers.&amp;nbsp; It takes eyeballs and a human brain to know when and how much to mist.&amp;nbsp; Besides, you should be checking your projects more than once per day during fruiting anyway, which is also a good time to fan and/or mist.&amp;nbsp; When you move to much larger greenhouses or even mini-greenhouses, set up your fans and humidifiers, but not in tubs.&amp;nbsp; Do tubs such as terrariums and monotubs by hand and eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>13052964</prev>\n<first>13052369</first>\n<last>13053144</last>\n<when>1281849829</when>\n<utime>08/15/10 08:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
