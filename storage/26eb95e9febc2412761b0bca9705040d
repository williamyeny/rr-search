I'm not crazy about putting tyvek under the lid because it tends to get damp.  The other problem I had with plastic lids was sometimes when shaking, the lid would pop off and send grains flying everywhere.  Those problems were fairly rare, but still anoying.  I'm sure some brands of lids are better than others though, and I have some of those lids agar was making, and they rock.<br />Nobody has to agree on stuff-that's why it's a <i>public</i> forum, so let's all check our attitudes at the door please.<br />RR"}}
