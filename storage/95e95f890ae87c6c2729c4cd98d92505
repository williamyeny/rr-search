To ground, I unscrew the green/yellow wire there and hook the ground of my cord to that, right? The instructions that came with are for the wrong blower and the wording makes it sound like I could just duct tape the fucker to the chassis somewhere.</blockquote><br />The green wire from your cord should also land where the green/yellow wire lands.&nbsp; Make sure all are firmly connected to the metal parts of the frame.&nbsp; This ensures that if a hot wire comes loose or the motor shorts out, the electrical path will be to ground via the wires, not your body if you're touching it.<br />RR"}}
