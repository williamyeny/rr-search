It does not seem to be humidified by the perlite at all, my cakes dried up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a typical new grower mistake.&amp;nbsp; Your cakes are supposed to dry out.&amp;nbsp; If they didn't, they wouldn't fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this tells is that you're not properly misting.&amp;nbsp; Even at 99% humidity, your cakes will dry out without proper misting.&amp;nbsp; Simply increase the amount of water you're spraying on the cakes.&amp;nbsp; The overspray from this keeps the perlite wet so it never dries out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19466279</next>\n<prev>19466245</prev>\n<first>19466130</first>\n<last>19466789</last>\n<when>1390570575</when>\n<utime>01/24/14 03:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
