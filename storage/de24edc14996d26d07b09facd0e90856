With larger substrates, the brf at top compresses the brf at the bottom, cutting it off for access to the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the air, what little there is, tends to get stale at the bottom of larger jars, preventing colonization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your chances of a quart jar of brf colonizing is pretty small.&amp;nbsp; I didn't say impossible, but very small chance indeed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12285359</next>\n<prev>12285342</prev>\n<first>12284453</first>\n<last>12286285</last>\n<when>1269748258</when>\n<utime>03/28/10 06:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
