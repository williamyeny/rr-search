{"key":"post-7097214","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7097214</id>\n<content>Aborts will stay aborted.  They don't recover.  Those are your second flush pins.  Often, they're set during first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can dunk a cake with pins.  They'll grow during the dunk in fact, often doubling in size.   Any that don't grow, or have black heads are aborts, so pick those off after the dunk, before placing back into fruiting conditions.  Good luck.   Nice first flush by the way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7097124</prev>\n<first>7096444</first>\n<last>7097214</last>\n<when>1182923232</when>\n<utime>06/27/07 08:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
