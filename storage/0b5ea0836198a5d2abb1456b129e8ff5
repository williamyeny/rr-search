This totally is new to me. I know what agar is, but that's about the extent of my knowledge. I was also considering trying cyans, but I want to stay as close to my current method as possible. Staying with cubes would probably be better for me right now.</blockquote><br />You can't order isolates but you can <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Strain-Isolation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">isolate strains on agar</a>, and then test each one with brf cakes.&nbsp; Once you find the best performing strains, you save master slants and then you grow those isolates forever with guaranteed potency.&nbsp; Growing from spores is like a family with ten kids: They'll have a fat one or two, a skinny one or two, a smart one, a few dumb ones, a criminal, etc.<br />RR"}}
