Once it drains, dump that into your terrarium.  A two inch layer should as said above, last through several flushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humidity will be higher with no standing water.  Perlite has a huge amount of surface area due to its structure, so all that surface area will be evaporating water.  With standing water, you're limited in surface area to the significantly smaller surface of the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5124898</next>\n<prev>5124687</prev>\n<first>5124641</first>\n<last>5124898</last>\n<when>1136010806</when>\n<utime>12/31/05 08:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
