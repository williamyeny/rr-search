I colonize everything at room temperature, even during wintertime.  I haven't even owned an incubator in years.<br />In addition, colonizing mycelium as agar pointed out, generates its own heat.  The process is called thermogenesis.  I've seen up to a fifteen degree F increase in substrate temperature over ambient air temperature with manure based substrates.<br />RR"}}
