In fact, it's an indication that you have low humidity because your humidity has been stolen from the air to be deposited on the surface of the terrarium.  What it indicates is a temperature differential between inside and outside the terrarium.  Nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not stop misting.  Mushrooms are 90% water and the purpose of a casing layer is to supply moisture to the flush.  Daily, or several times daily misting is required for large fruits and good performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As primordia are developing, it's a good idea to back off on misting for a day or two, but once you have pins in place, it's safe to mist again to keep the casing layer nice and moist.  It's also important to have plenty of air exchange because you don't want the pins to sit there wet, or they'll abort.  Lots of water, and lots of fresh air is the key to success.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6986372</next>\n<prev>6986312</prev>\n<first>6986312</first>\n<last>6990335</last>\n<when>1180538492</when>\n<utime>05/30/07 06:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
