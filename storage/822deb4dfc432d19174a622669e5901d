In three decades of growing, I've not learned to recognize that.  Mycelium is white, rather it's trichoderma or mushroom mycelium.<br />If you're suggesting that cutting out 'contamination' means removing all the green, you only get the spores, not the mycelium, which likely permeates the whole cake.<br />Toss out green mold infected substrates, or place them outside and let nature fix it.<br />RR"}}
