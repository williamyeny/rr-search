I've personally never seen a bacterial contaminated, stinky jar produce mushrooms anyway, so don't worry about that.  If a jar has green molds in it, don't open the jar until you cook it first or do something else to kill off the spores.  Especially if it has black or brown molds, don't open or sniff.  Green molds are not toxic to humans, but will ruin your crop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's natural for manure based substrates to have lots of live bacteria.  This makes eating fresh raw mushrooms from these substrates a potential for mild food poisoning even if the mushies look ok. You can decrease the odds of getting sick by cutting off the bottom inch or so of the stem that was in contact with or near the manure based substrate.  I recommend drying first, or boiling into tea if you grow on manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5107191</next>\n<prev>5106739</prev>\n<first>5105217</first>\n<last>5114688</last>\n<when>1135613024</when>\n<utime>12/26/05 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
