If they sit in a terrarium wet and in still air, they'll abort.  I wouldn't recommend misting and then touching them with anything.   A syringe works very well for squirting a bit of water in between the pins to wet the casing layer.  You can also lay a sheet of wax paper over the primordia to hold moisture in during the time you should avoid misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6057552</next>\n<prev>6057500</prev>\n<first>6057500</first>\n<last>6058505</last>\n<when>1158182892</when>\n<utime>09/14/06 12:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
