The second two I added gypsum and as I said, nothing grew so.... Yea, If it works for others its because your waters ph is high enough that the tbs of gypsum lowers it to optimal conditions for germination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are absolutely incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, gypsum isn't going to alter the pH much, other than to return it to neutral, since it's neutral or nearly so.&amp;nbsp; In addition, mushroom mycelium prefers to germinate and grow at a pH of around 5, so your hypothesis about what went wrong(low pH) is totally off the mark.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, why would you add something to lower the pH, add gypsum and then raise the pH???&amp;nbsp; It makes no sense whatever.&amp;nbsp; You screwed up somewhere else, but it wasn't the gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HybridprX said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel that the tap waters ph that I used was already low and the addition of the gypsum lowered it enough that the spores will not germinate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the pH of the tap water was low, the gypsum would have raised it back towards neutral.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest some more reading about mineral supplements.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the idea expressed earlier that gypsum, a rock that is quarried out of the ground would have fungicides, is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15310970</next>\n<prev>15310130</prev>\n<first>15307605</first>\n<last>19067598</last>\n<when>1320202758</when>\n<utime>11/02/11 05:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
