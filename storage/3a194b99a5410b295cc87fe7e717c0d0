You can spray the casing layer and mushroom, but be careful to allow extra air exchange afterwards so it can dry off.  Don't leave pins wet for any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use a blue light.  There is 'some' evidence that light at the 'blue end of the spectrum' helps with pinning, that doesn't mean you want a light that looks blue or has a blue dye on the bulb.  Look for short wavelength light such as cool white fluorescent, which are cheap and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have rhizomorphs coming up through the casing layer, which is very good, and the fuzzy mycelium on the base of the fruit is completely normal.  However, that surface looks a bit dry.   I'd aim the mister up in the air, so a very gentle mist falls on it.  Do this several times over a few hours to get the casing layer moisture to optimum, increasing air exchange afterward each time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6616015</next>\n<prev>6595296</prev>\n<first>6594936</first>\n<last>6616611</last>\n<when>1172120817</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 07:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
