Trichoderma blooms like crazy in wet woods.  I live in Seattle and it's just downwind from the Hoh rainforest, which is probably the birthplace of half the trichoderma in the northern US.  In Las Vegas or Salt Lake City, one can be sloppy and get away with it.  In Houston, St Louis, or any points east of that you darn well better follow proper technique.<br />RR"}}
