Two liters of grain spawn cased?  No bulk there, only spawn and casing.  Any uncolonized grain spawn is likely to contaminate with molds, once exposed to air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 generations?  What sort of harvests did the other 4 generations deliver?  A 'generation' means you fruited a flush, made a spore print, germinated the spores and grew them again.  Do that five times and you have five generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I've advised for years to NOT wrap the sides of trays with aluminum foil.  The foil reflects light deep into the substrate, causing bottom and side pinning.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8341238</next>\n<prev>8341169</prev>\n<first>8339547</first>\n<last>8341698</last>\n<when>1209480857</when>\n<utime>04/29/08 05:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
