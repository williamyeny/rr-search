I did 24 transfers in the open air using a spoon cleaned with bleach and alcohol. all the jars fully colonised and were spawned to 5 different coir bulk trays all of which had three healthy flushes. Two of those 24 jars were even used for a further G2G which resulted in a another 16 healthy jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do noobs always post this kind of crap?&amp;nbsp; Anyone who has grown mushrooms knows it isn't true.&amp;nbsp; You'd be hard pressed to get 100% success like that with years of experience, a laminar flow hood and a certified clean room.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't happen in open air, especially using a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19633645</next>\n<prev>19633425</prev>\n<first>19623770</first>\n<last>20409181</last>\n<when>1393676447</when>\n<utime>03/01/14 02:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
