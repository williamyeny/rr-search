{"key":"post-6017838","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6017838</id>\n<content>I see a couple of problems.  First, heating terrariums almost never works out.  It causes condensation to form on the sides, and this condensation is humidity you need in the air.  You need to heat the room the project is in, not the project itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, copes don't do well in thick substrates.  Most monotub grows have thicker than 1 1/2&quot; substrates, which should be considered maximum with pans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you'll want to remove any polyfill in the holes to acheive air exchange.  The polyfil might allow gas exchange, but not enough fresh air for copes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, put vent holes top and bottom for circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I'd use small trays rather than a monotob which puts all your eggs are in one basket.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6017897</next>\n<prev>6017826</prev>\n<first>6017633</first>\n<last>6018221</last>\n<when>1157124870</when>\n<utime>09/01/06 06:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
