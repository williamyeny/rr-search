Mushrooms improperly dried can have live bacteria, which causes food poisoning.  The question I answered above concerned molds.  If all molds were toxic, we'd get sick from eating any form of cheese or using salad dressing, and especially from those antibiotics we take when sick which are made from the metabolites secreted from molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite obviously, we wouldn't eat a moldy piece of bread(although it probably wouldn't hurt us), so don't eat an obviously moldy mushroom or anything else.   There is just a ton of disinformation spread around the boards that eating a mushroom from a substrate with green mold on it is going to hurt you, which it will not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6566251</prev>\n<first>6565536</first>\n<last>6570062</last>\n<when>1171554735</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
