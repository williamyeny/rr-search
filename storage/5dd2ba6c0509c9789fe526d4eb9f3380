Endospore-forming bacteria begin to form new endospores within an hour of germination. In addition, popcorn is the worst possible choice for spawn because it contains so many endospore-forming bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main function of the soak is to hydrate the grains.&amp;nbsp; While doing this, you also hydrate and soften the endospores, making them easier to kill in the pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; I also used to buy into the necessity of 'germinating' the endospores, but I no longer feel that's the best course of action.&amp;nbsp; A four hour soak in hot water is plenty.&amp;nbsp; After four hours, not many endospores have germinated, but they're killed in the PC nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; Above 24 hours, you've flooded your soak water and grains with more endospores than you started with, actually increasing your chances of failure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>21148774</next>\n<prev>12735102</prev>\n<first>3982155</first>\n<last>25981783</last>\n<when>1276442711</when>\n<utime>06/13/10 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
