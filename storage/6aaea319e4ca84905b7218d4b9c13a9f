Besides, perlite alone would give 95% to 99%.  Don't confuse humidity in the air with added liquid moisture to the cake or perlite.  Even at 100% humidity, you wouldn't be adding moisture to your project, you would only be slowing down the rate of evaporation.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7859481</next>\n<prev>7859225</prev>\n<first>7859017</first>\n<last>22998054</last>\n<when>1199995627</when>\n<utime>01/10/08 10:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
