When the pins start growing, you can put a tablespoon or so of vermiculite on top of the cakes, and then pour a bit of water to that every day to keep the cakes nice and moist.  This will give a bit more water to support the flush.  It's especially important if you have a good pinset, because they can drain a cake dry in no time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6964511</next>\n<prev>6964098</prev>\n<first>6951321</first>\n<last>6970059</last>\n<when>1180074973</when>\n<utime>05/25/07 09:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
