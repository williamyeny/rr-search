You must carefully pick the fruits, then remove them without allowing the spores that are on the mold to become airborne.  This usually is best done by wrapping the infected fruits in tyvek or plastic before taking them to the trash outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never water or mist fruits that have vert contamination because this sends the spores into the air.  You'll need to clean your FC very well before the next cropping cycle.  The key to preventing vert contamination is air exchanage, just as with other imperfect fungi, they thrive in still, stale, moist air.  They also thrive in warmer air, so you might try reducing the temperature on future crops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your next crop, be sure to leave the lid on the FC loose so it's open all the time.  You can also drill holes all over the surface of the FC on all six sides to provide for air exchange between fannings.  Moving to a coolmist for a tub type FC is not an upgrade.  Perlite is best for small fruiting chambers.  If humidity is higher than you wish, simply increase air exchange, but leave the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest posting a picture because often water damage from drips falling from the lid are mistaken for verticillium, when in fact it's just water damage.  You might try misting with peroxide to see if the entire fruit turns to a fizzing ball of slime, which is what you'll get if verticillium OR cobweb(Dactylium) is colonizing the fruitbody.  The peroxide is not to 'cure' the mold but only to help identify it.  Often the stipes tend to split on their own without molds being present.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6641734</next>\n<prev>6636652</prev>\n<first>6636326</first>\n<last>6641734</last>\n<when>1173112262</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 06:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
