For a quart jar, I use 1 1/4 cup of grass seed, and 5/8 cup of water.  Add a pinch of gypsum between your thumb and forefinger per jar.  Half the amount of water can be substituted with brewed coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a solid lid on the jar after mixing and shake well.  Allow to sit over night, then shake again.  Replace the solid lid with a filtered lid and PC for an hour at 15psi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6129047</next>\n<prev>6126953</prev>\n<first>6119561</first>\n<last>6129047</last>\n<when>1159884385</when>\n<utime>10/03/06 05:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
