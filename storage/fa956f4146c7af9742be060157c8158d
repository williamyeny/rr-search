Use brf/verm jars as soon as possible.  There really is no such thing as complete sterilization.  When you boil or pc jars for an hour, you're really only giving your substrate a 'window of opportunity' to get colonized before the contaminants that survived the pc cycle get a foothold.  Use as soon as possible.  Leaving the foil on is counter productive.  It causes condensation to get the verm barrier or other filter damp, and a damp filter can easily be colonized right through by contaminants trying to get to your substrate below.<br />RR"}}
