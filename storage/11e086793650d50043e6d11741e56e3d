Molds are killed off by temps around 130F, and most live bacteria is killed off by 180F, so even a few microwave grows have succeeded.  However, anyone who owns an oven, usually has a stovetop to boil/steam the jars, which is the tried and true way that can achieve 100% success, but there's nothing wrong with experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7052394</next>\n<prev>7052122</prev>\n<first>7051427</first>\n<last>7254458</last>\n<when>1182005284</when>\n<utime>06/16/07 05:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
