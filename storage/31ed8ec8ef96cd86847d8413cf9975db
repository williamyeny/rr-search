It sounds like your uncased coir dried out.  Also, the edges are the last part to colonize, so if it's colonized everywhere you can see, it's also colonized in the middle.  Never stir up a fully colonized substrate.  You can probably dunk that coir block and get a great second flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7418900</next>\n<prev>7418896</prev>\n<first>7417855</first>\n<last>7419360</last>\n<when>1190031744</when>\n<utime>09/17/07 03:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
