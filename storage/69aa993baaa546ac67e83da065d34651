There's a huge difference in application between a sterilizer and a pressure cooker. A sterilizer is used for fifteen minutes or so for tools and other equipment in a medical environment.   A PC is used for an hour or more.  You want a bit of steam escaping during a long cycle to keep the heat at 250F to go along with the 15psi.  With a closed stopcock, there's the chance you can have 15 psi due to expansion, but have far less than 250F, especially if it's been half an hour or more since you closed the stop.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5843490</next>\n<prev>5842018</prev>\n<first>5841387</first>\n<last>5844066</last>\n<when>1152568074</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 12:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
