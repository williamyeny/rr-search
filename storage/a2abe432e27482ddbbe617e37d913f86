Rinse under the faucet both before and after the dunk.  Wait one week after full colonization, then do a dunk and roll.  Room temp works fine, but I'd suggest taking them out at 12 hours and rinsing again, and changing the dunk water for fresh.  I dunk in a large kettle, with a heavy glass dinner plate to hold the cakes under water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7026634</next>\n<prev>7025322</prev>\n<first>7025215</first>\n<last>7026634</last>\n<when>1181401013</when>\n<utime>06/09/07 05:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
