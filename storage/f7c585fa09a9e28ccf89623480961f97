This helps to establish the circadian rhythm of day/night which will help later.&amp;nbsp; In addition, low levels of ambient lighting speed up colonization.&amp;nbsp; Keep colonizing mycelium out of direct sunlight, but not in darkness, which is outdated information, long since proved false.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12772646</next>\n<prev>12771997</prev>\n<first>12770198</first>\n<last>12775173</last>\n<when>1277038753</when>\n<utime>06/20/10 03:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
