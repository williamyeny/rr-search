It is entirely possible and practical to breed dikaryons.  One does not need monokaryotic mycelium, although that's also a possibility.  If you folks are talking about cubensis here, '&lt;i&gt;strains&lt;/i&gt;' will readily cross with each other.  It might take a few tries to find compatible hyphae, but then again compare the number of isolates from a single strain that develop compared to the number of spores injected into the media.  Not all spores germinate, and not all are compatible with each other, but hyphae from the same species are generally compatible, and when they're crossed they're not hybrids in my opinion, but simply crosses.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7724815</next>\n<prev>7685618</prev>\n<first>7680625</first>\n<last>7724815</last>\n<when>1196189180</when>\n<utime>11/27/07 08:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
