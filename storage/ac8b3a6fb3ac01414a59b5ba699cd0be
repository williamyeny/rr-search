Be sure to not mist heavily.  Chances are, if the swab test was negative, it's not mold, but watch it for sure. I agree it doesn't really look the color of mold.  In addition, mold will be a separate layer on the surface, as if you poured green sand on top.  Bruising will be the color of the substrate itself. Hopefully,  you'll get a nice flush and that will hold you over until you can get some more spores and get a fresh start.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
