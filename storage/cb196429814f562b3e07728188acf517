YOu shouldn't have to re-lube it but every 3-5 uses. Are you getting any leaking while the unit is at pressure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, but with qualifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the metal to metal seal before each use and re-lube.&amp;nbsp; The reason is that dust and dirt sticks to the vaseline between uses, and if not cleaned off, will scratch the mating surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one lives in a very clean environment with no dust or dirt, every three or four uses is fine because the lube doesn't wear out.&amp;nbsp; However, if dirt is stuck to the greasy surfaces and you tighten down the lid, you fubar your expensive equipment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14053409</next>\n<prev>14053368</prev>\n<first>14051768</first>\n<last>14410368</last>\n<when>1299081687</when>\n<utime>03/02/11 06:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
