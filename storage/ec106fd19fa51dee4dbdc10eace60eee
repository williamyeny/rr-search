What are the pros/cons of each? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bottom of the grain jars didn't colonize, something is wrong.  Don't use them for grain to grain transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A petri dish that is fully colonized is not one that I'd use to inoculate grain masters with, even if the dish was wrapped with parafilm.  I'd suggest taking a small piece of mycelium from the petri dishes, and use it to inoculate fresh dishes.  Allow that to grow for a few days, and then grab a very tiny piece of mycelium from the leading edge of the new growth.  Transfer that fresh mycelium to a third dish and allow to grow 2/3 of the way across the dish.  This clean mycelium can then be used to inoculate up to ten 1 quart/liter grain masters, which can each inoculate ten more via grain to grain transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I avoid taking the uncolonized agar when I make the transfers by outlining the mycelium growth with my scalpel so I only take what's covered with mycelium, and none at all from the very edges of the petri dish, where contaminant spores may have entered and be laying dormant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7905426</next>\n<prev>7905303</prev>\n<first>7905270</first>\n<last>7905942</last>\n<when>1200852924</when>\n<utime>01/20/08 08:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
