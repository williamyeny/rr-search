Many commercial mushroom farms toss out substrates after two flushes because that piece of real estate is better used with a fresh tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't re-incubate a casing any more than you can jump back into your mothers womb and be re-born.  When mycelium fully colonizes a substrate and goes into fruiting mode, veg growth stops for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunking is an accepted tek that has been proved to be effective for many years.  As suggested, you can dunk in the tray you fruit in by letting the kitchen faucet gently run into the tray for a few hours, overflowing it.  This procedure actually washes contaminant spores off your project and down the drain, making it less susceptible to contamination.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's correct to patch the divots that are sometimes created when you harvest.  Also, dunking under running water washes away much of the uncolonized casing material.  After the dunk, simply apply fresh casing material into the divots and anywhere else that has exposed mycelium, such as around the edges where the substrate has shrunk.  Don't go more than 1/4&quot; deep, because it isn't going to colonize anyway, it's just for the micro-environment that a casing layer provides.  Do not incubate after patching.  Simply patch after the dunk and return to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874801</next>\n<prev>5874219</prev>\n<first>5874073</first>\n<last>7245194</last>\n<when>1153264217</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 02:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
