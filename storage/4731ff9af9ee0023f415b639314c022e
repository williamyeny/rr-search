You'll have to make provisions to allow the pressure to escape from the bag as the PC cools down or the bag will burst.  I use a tyvek sleeve placed the entire length of the flap from the substrate to the end of the bag.  This allows the pressure to escape, but also filters any air that tries to seep back into the bags.  Using this method, I've left them to sit on a countertop in open air for several days prior to inoculation.  The tyvek prevents contaminants from entering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use steel tie-wire to seal the bags.  I don't even own an impulse sealer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7399740</next>\n<prev>7399257</prev>\n<first>7399130</first>\n<last>7399766</last>\n<when>1189601656</when>\n<utime>09/12/07 03:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
