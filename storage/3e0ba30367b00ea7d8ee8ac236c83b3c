Moisture content is critical, and must be set at the time the jars are made up.  A possible fix is to turn the jars upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a warm room already, get the jars out of the box and onto a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't want to get gasses in a jar, you want them to be able to get out.  This is why we drill holes in the lids and use a filter to prevent contaminant spores from entering.  You shouldn't need to unscrew the lids if you have filtered vents in the top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6077262</next>\n<prev>6073152</prev>\n<first>6072816</first>\n<last>6077401</last>\n<when>1158587569</when>\n<utime>09/18/06 04:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
