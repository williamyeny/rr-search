Most types of lime work great on your lawn where they have all season to break down, but the average life of a casing layer is two months or less, so granulated lime doesn't have time to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My formula that has always worked fine is to use hydrated lime at 5% by volume of the peat moss used.  In other words, for ten cups of peat, use 1/2 cup of lime.  Don't count the vermiculite when making the calculation, only the peat.  This will give a starting ph in the area of 8 to 8 1/2.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4602732</next>\n<prev>4602557</prev>\n<first>4354261</first>\n<last>4602732</last>\n<when>1125492596</when>\n<utime>08/31/05 03:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
