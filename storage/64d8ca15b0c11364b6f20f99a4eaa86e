It's actually good in my experience because it tends to increase diversity.  For example, shooting half a jar with PR and the other half with Thai will yield no 'fighting' or 'competition'.  You may or may not get a cross, but in my experience after hundreds of mixes that way, there is no detrimental effect, and it's just like any other multispore inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different species should be cultivated apart from each other.  There is a big difference between 'strain' and 'species'.  You wouldn't want to cultivate cubensis and shiitake in the same substrate, for example.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6956805</next>\n<prev>6945104</prev>\n<first>6945052</first>\n<last>6956859</last>\n<when>1179728086</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 09:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
