Is that a small amount??? I have 5 cakes in total and 1/2 pint mason jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you're doing something wrong but you gave no info for anyone to help with.&amp;nbsp; Cakes have the highest possible biological efficiency of any substrate, so members who can't get cakes down shouldn't move on to other substrates until they figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people around here are getting several dry grams per cake, which is well over 100% B.E.&amp;nbsp; Proper moisture content, fresh air, light and humidity are all important.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13244485</next>\n<prev>13244355</prev>\n<first>13243992</first>\n<last>13254497</last>\n<when>1285433478</when>\n<utime>09/25/10 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
