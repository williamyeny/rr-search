The cheap mega-mart hepa filters are little more than a furnace filter.  The biggest problem with them is the increased resistance, which which will throw off the head pressure on your AC unit, possibly causing it to ice over or trip the high pressure cut-out switch inside the unit.  <br />In addition, I can put one of those paper 'hepa' filters under my microscope and see right through it to the base of the scope below.  The openings are WAY larger than a contaminant spore.<br />When doing sterile work, all filters, fans, AC/heat units should be turned <u>off</u>.  In addition, I have four or five of those free standing so-called HEPA units they sell at hardware stores for $150 sitting in my storage shed.  I used to have one in each room.  I actually had a decrease in contaminants when I removed them.  They stir the air around something horrible and cause more contaminant spores in the air than they filter out.  Still air is the key to sterile work.  Even when using my laminar flow hood, I shut off all fans and work in a small room with the door and windows closed and sealed tightly.  I even lay a clean towel at the bottom of the door to cut off flow to/from the other rooms in the house.<br />RR"}}
