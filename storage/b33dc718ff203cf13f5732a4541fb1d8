The tape should be removed from all jars after inoculation because the mushroom mycelium requires gas exchange.  If you remove tape and 24 hours later see molds, rest assured the molds were there several days before removing the tape.  The spores from some of the so-called 'brown molds' can be very dangerous if inhaled, so NEVER birth a contaminated cake.  Peroxide dunks are useless.  I hope that clears up some of the disinformation you've read.  Start over, but spend some time here reading the information first.  You'll find everything you need to know to have successful grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6849382</next>\n<prev>6848796</prev>\n<first>6848514</first>\n<last>6853948</last>\n<when>1177863144</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
