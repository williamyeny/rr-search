Coir, coffee, and peat all have similar Ph at around 5.  Use one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of each to balance the Ph.  Oyster shell flour can be used, but isn't as effective as hydrated lime because hydrated lime goes to work right away when you need it.  Once the substrate is fully colonized, it can take care of itself, making so-called 'long term buffers' unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your 1/2 pint of brf is a bare minimum, so any substrate you inoculate better be small.  Don't try to go more than a 1 to 4 ratio to your bulk substrate or it might take too long to colonize, resulting in contaminants.  That means use no more than a quart of pasteurized substrate.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6281932</prev>\n<first>6281883</first>\n<last>6281982</last>\n<when>1163526822</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 07:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
