A tire is best in my opinion, but make sure to use a pump to air the tire up so it's nearly rock hard first. I use about 70# in the bicycle tire/wheel I keep in my lab. Half a dozen whacks against a fully inflated tire will have all the individual kernels separated from each other, so you can simply pour and twist the master as you fill the receiving jars with no touching of the grains themselves.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6095444</next>\n<prev>6095378</prev>\n<first>6095364</first>\n<last>6097971</last>\n<when>1159117678</when>\n<utime>09/24/06 08:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
