Peroxide is toxic to fungi, all fungi.  Some can tolerate it better than others, but none 'like it'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterile technique is the way to avoid contaminants in mushroom culture.  That can be aided by not incubating at such a high temperature.  I suggest never incubating over 80F, as that stimulates thermophilic molds and bacteria more than the mushroom mycelium, which thrives at lower temperatures also.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6458202</next>\n<prev>6452647</prev>\n<first>6448247</first>\n<last>6479331</last>\n<when>1168641912</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 12:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
