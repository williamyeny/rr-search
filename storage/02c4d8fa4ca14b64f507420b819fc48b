It's always a crap shoot with multispore inoculation.  You can let those go for awhile longer.  If they start to make a mess with spores, pick them.  You can carefully slice off the ones to be picked with a sharp knife in order to leave smaller ones nearby to grow some more.  Clean off the stumps that are left when you get ready to dunk for the next flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6707883</next>\n<prev>6707837</prev>\n<first>6707770</first>\n<last>6718220</last>\n<when>1174798399</when>\n<utime>03/25/07 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
