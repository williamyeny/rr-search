The mycelium has already gone from vegetative to fruiting stage, so the casing layer would just be in the way.  Dunk the substate after picking instead of putting a casing layer on.<br />It's a good idea to let the substrate sit for 4 to 7 days after picking a flush to dry out a bit and 'rest' before dunking.  This will bring the next flush faster.<br />RR"}}
