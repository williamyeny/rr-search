There's no rot or mold.&amp;nbsp; They even survived all last winter under the snow, thawing out and fruiting again this year, old stumps and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a cake starts to dry out mid flush, you can set it in a saucer of water overnight to allow the cake to soak up the water.&amp;nbsp; You can also pile up some verm on top of the cake and soak that. Or both.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13190604</next>\n<prev>13186082</prev>\n<first>13182132</first>\n<last>25095212</last>\n<when>1284336943</when>\n<utime>09/13/10 03:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
