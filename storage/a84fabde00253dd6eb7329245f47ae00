You can use the bagged up composted cow manure from a local nursery.  Cut it with 25% or so vermiculite to fluff it up.  Use a thin substrate, no more than 1 1/2&quot; thickness.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7706245</next>\n<prev>7705559</prev>\n<first>7705559</first>\n<last>7706257</last>\n<when>1196610964</when>\n<utime>12/02/07 05:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
