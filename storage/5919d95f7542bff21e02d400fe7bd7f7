You want the substrate at the center of the bag to be at 140F to 160F for at least an hour.  Using a spawn bag in 170F water for 2 hours won't raise the interior temperature of your substrate nearly enough.  Try it again, but boiling the water for the first ten minutes, then put a lid on the kettle to hold in the heat.  Put your thermometer into the center of the substrate bag and position it so you can see when you lift the lid.  Check it every few minutes and adjust your stove as needed until you get your system worked out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7249284</next>\n<prev>7247993</prev>\n<first>7247554</first>\n<last>7273450</last>\n<when>1186022171</when>\n<utime>08/02/07 05:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
