The weird growth is something we've been seeing a lot lately due to strain degeneration.  Fresh genetics need to be brought in from the wild.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yellowing is just old, matted mycelium.  If it were on a casing layer, we'd call it 'overlay'.  I doubt they'll fruit well if at all, so I'd be starting a fresh project while you wait those out.  Toss them on first sight of green.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6387354</next>\n<prev>6385908</prev>\n<first>6385618</first>\n<last>6407576</last>\n<when>1166548849</when>\n<utime>12/19/06 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
