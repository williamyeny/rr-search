The holes will be enough and you can air it out when you check on them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A casing is the non-nutritious layer that goes on top of the substrate, should you chose to use one.  What you are attempting to fruit is an 'un-cased bulk substrate'.  You don't have a casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, get that thing off the carpet!  Never set an FC on the carpet. 90% of all contaminants in a room are within 12&quot; of the floor, and it's much worse with carpet, which traps and holds contaminant spores.   I don't see any holes in the FC you pictured.  Drill holes in all six sides.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6658343</next>\n<prev>6656584</prev>\n<first>6655355</first>\n<last>6658432</last>\n<when>1173587402</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 07:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
