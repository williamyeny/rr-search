Just cut arm holes and stick your hands through while wearing gloves.  Not having the gloves attached makes it easy to use an alcohol torch that you can keep outside the glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6306448</prev>\n<first>6305631</first>\n<last>6306457</last>\n<when>1164694430</when>\n<utime>11/28/06 08:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
