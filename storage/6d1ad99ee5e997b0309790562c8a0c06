Hopefully all can learn from others mistakes, but the first lesson is to be honest and sincere.  We all make mistakes when new, and even experience is no guarantee of success.  I just tossed out a moldy jar yesterday, so it happens to all of us, even with flowhood, gloves, mask, etc.  Let's all never stop learning, and try to live in peace.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6652439</prev>\n<first>6639298</first>\n<last>6652448</last>\n<when>1173462504</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
