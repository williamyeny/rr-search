So that's why I'm wandering what causes penicillium contam exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd give 99% odds it's your spawn.&amp;nbsp; Switch to a new culture.&amp;nbsp; Often, the mold will remain dormant until exposed to enough air to sporulate, which is what happens when you spawn to your straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's common for Trichoderma to sporulate on grains, so we can catch it, but I've noticed molds such as Cladisporium and Penicillium will sporulate on petri dishes or fruiting substrates, but rarely on grain spawn.&amp;nbsp; I don't really know why, just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15410941</prev>\n<first>15410654</first>\n<last>15411764</last>\n<when>1322054120</when>\n<utime>11/23/11 03:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
