Just provide increased air exchange afterwards so they can dry out a tad.  You can also spray gently between the pins, or even take the sprayer off your misting bottle and pour gently between the pins.  You can also pour directly around the edges, then an hour or two later, turn it upside down and drain off any water that hasn't been absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those don't look too good there.  They're in danger of aborting if they haven't yet.  I'd say they need more air exchange and brighter light.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6686725</next>\n<prev>6686695</prev>\n<first>6684303</first>\n<last>6716236</last>\n<when>1174324947</when>\n<utime>03/19/07 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
