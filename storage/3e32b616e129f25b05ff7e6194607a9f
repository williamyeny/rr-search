It will also help to expell the CO2 that builds up.  Put down some jar rings or something similar and set your trays on those to elevate them.  This keeps all your perlite in contact with the air to humidify the terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6554385</next>\n<prev>6553732</prev>\n<first>6553638</first>\n<last>6554385</last>\n<when>1171221434</when>\n<utime>02/11/07 09:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
