Once you birth them, or spawn into a casing, the need for total sterility goes away.  There is no need to keep a terrarium sterile, so no problem.<br />As a side note, I keep tropical fish, and every aquarium pump I've purchased has polyfil stuffed into the intake when I buy it.  Not that it matters, but most high end aquarium pumps will deliver filtered air anyway."}}
