Get rid of the ultrasonic, drill a few holes in all six sides of the fruiting chamber, and add four to five inches of rinsed, and then well drained perlite. This will give you the upper 90's humidity you need.  Don't complicate cakes/terrariums.  They don't need or want technical stuff.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7539984</next>\n<prev>7539620</prev>\n<first>7539446</first>\n<last>7544769</last>\n<when>1192918304</when>\n<utime>10/21/07 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
