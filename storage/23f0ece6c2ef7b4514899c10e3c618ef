You indeed have a swamp there, and nothing will come of it.   Get rid of that excess water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you do, clean the edges of the tray to get that mess off.  You don't want your mycelium trying to climb the walls, where the excess substrate material will just dry out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7105001</next>\n<prev>7104733</prev>\n<first>7104662</first>\n<last>7105059</last>\n<when>1183082113</when>\n<utime>06/29/07 04:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
