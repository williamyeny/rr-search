Potting soil was the old standard casing material prior to the development of peat based casing layers which are superior.  Many growers have used various potting soils for casing with fair to good results.  Proper pasteurization should take care of molds and mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7723612</prev>\n<first>7722419</first>\n<last>7723626</last>\n<when>1196957201</when>\n<utime>12/06/07 06:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
