If you could maintain the 65C temperature at the center of the substrate for an hour, it would be pasteurized,  but if the dishwasher is only reaching 65C, it would take a few hours.  However, many growers have successfully colonized unpasteurized manure.  <br />I'd suggest following standard pasteurizing teks for the casing layer, if used.  They're far less forgiving than substrates, which fully colonize.<br />RR"}}
