Are you sure it's not just the verm on top that isn't colonized?  Sometimes a bit of the verm barrier drops down the side and doesn't colonize.  I'd wait one more week, and then birth, wash well under the faucet, and give each cake a good sniff.  If they smell like fresh mushrooms, roll in dry verm per the dunk and roll tek, and place in fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6906730</next>\n<prev>6906680</prev>\n<first>6906680</first>\n<last>6907276</last>\n<when>1179013297</when>\n<utime>05/13/07 02:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
