Often new folks try it, then when they get to the casing stage, they see green.  Most green molds in bulk substrates were introduced at spawning.  It's from improper sterilization.  You need steam to sterilize without drying out your substrate.  Water can't exist in a liquid state without being under pressure at a temp above 212F/100C, so if you get to steriliztion temperature in the oven, your substrate will be as dry as sand in the Sahara desert.  One must listen to those who have blazed the trails before.  Follow the teks until you grow a few mushrooms, then use that knowledge to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5942924</prev>\n<first>5942433</first>\n<last>5943396</last>\n<when>1155046083</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 05:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
