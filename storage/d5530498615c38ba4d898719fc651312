Sterilized at around 170 for 6 or so hours. Inoculated with orissa india the next morning using a LC syringe. Put bags in incubator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;170F doesn't sterilize, nor does the oven.&amp;nbsp; Blood meal will have no effect if it's not composted with the substrate.&amp;nbsp; Coffee water needs to be sterilized.&amp;nbsp; You can't inoculate bulk substrates with spores or LC.&amp;nbsp; You need grains or brf as a jumping off medium. That's five out of five possible mistakes.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest since you're new to growing that you follow established techniques rather than inventing your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Begin with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt;, and then once you've mastered those in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;, move on to bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; Best of luck and welcome to the board.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9613811</prev>\n<first>9613776</first>\n<last>9613849</last>\n<when>1232042712</when>\n<utime>01/15/09 08:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
