{"key":"post-6041437","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6041437</id>\n<content>There are no rules for mixing substrates.  Coir can be used as is, or you can dump in a few days worth of coffee grinds from your leftover morning pots of coffee.  Worm castings, horse manure, etc., can all be added by the handfull, or each can even be used for 100% of the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use between 5% and 10% gypsum by volume.  Use 1/2 teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of manure based substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NPK is for plants and is irrelevant for mushrooms. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6041469</next>\n<prev>6041409</prev>\n<first>6041409</first>\n<last>6047692</last>\n<when>1157744475</when>\n<utime>09/08/06 10:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
