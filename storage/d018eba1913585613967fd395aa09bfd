Don't spread information that was discredited many years ago.  Light doesn't even tell the mycelium when to fruit.  That's what full colonization, the corresponding drop in CO2 levels, and the introduction of fresh air does.  Lighting is a secondary pinning trigger, but needs to be very bright high frequency light for &lt;b&gt;best&lt;/b&gt; results.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7542140</next>\n<prev>7541765</prev>\n<first>7541119</first>\n<last>7542140</last>\n<when>1192974630</when>\n<utime>10/21/07 04:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
