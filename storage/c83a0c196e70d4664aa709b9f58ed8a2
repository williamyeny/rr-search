If steam is vented for a few minutes, maximum surface temperature is reached as 15 psi is reached. That's the reason to always do it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9499867</next>\n<prev>9499776</prev>\n<first>9499529</first>\n<last>9500298</last>\n<when>1230356225</when>\n<utime>12/27/08 07:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
