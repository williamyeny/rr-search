If you do buy that one, NEVER use the 'quick steam release button' or you're going to have very dry substrate, and very cracked jars.  Always allow a pressure cooker to return to zero pressure on its own, s l o w l y.  Simply shut off the heat when time expires and walk away for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5206317</next>\n<prev>5206198</prev>\n<first>5205009</first>\n<last>5206317</last>\n<when>1137871098</when>\n<utime>01/21/06 09:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
