The backpressure forces water into the bushings, which ruins them, and the increased load burns out the motor.  That is a fact.  Nobody thought it up.  Also, an induction motor is very capable of 'burning up'.  It has windings and current flow.  The presence of brushes has nothing to do with whether a motor can burn up or not.  With bad bushings, the excess current flow caused by the increased load smokes the windings.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5305857</next>\n<prev>5305247</prev>\n<first>5298346</first>\n<last>5328250</last>\n<when>1140098626</when>\n<utime>02/16/06 04:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
