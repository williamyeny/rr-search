There are no other cakes/trays. But&amp;nbsp; cake I had last week was bluish green so I dunked it. But this color is not the same tone of color. It is definately light green. &lt;b&gt;But no spores rubbed off on a q-tip. I researched it and the FAQ's said that the green color would rub off on the qtip if it was a mold.&lt;/b&gt; So I'm PRAYING that it's not trich. It's VERY light green. But it doesn't appear to have any bluish tones...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn it...now you got me really worried &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mad.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mad:&quot; title=&quot;:mad:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post a link to where you read that nonsense in the sticky at the top of the forum regarding bad info, to be deleted because it's flat-out wrong.&amp;nbsp; In fact, most of the FAQ is total crap here.&amp;nbsp; The q-tip test has long been known to be bunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like your substrate has dried out.&amp;nbsp; You can easily tell if it's too wet or too dry by picking it up and judging by the weight.&amp;nbsp; Disregard what you read above to stop misting.&amp;nbsp; You should be misting a few times daily.&amp;nbsp; If it's too dry, pour some water directly on top and let it sit for a few hours.&amp;nbsp; Then, pour off any excess that remains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15395749</next>\n<prev>15395536</prev>\n<first>15392806</first>\n<last>15397065</last>\n<when>1321766203</when>\n<utime>11/20/11 07:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
