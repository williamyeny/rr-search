If they were compatible they would have formed dikaryotic hyphae. But it is really hard to see in that shot. Is there a clear line without Myc where they come together?&amp;nbsp; In other words are they repelling each other?&amp;nbsp; If so they are incompatible strains. You can always just put a small wedge from say five different plates in each jar to increase likelihood of compatibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to clarify something, strains &lt;i&gt;already are&lt;/i&gt; dikaryotic.&amp;nbsp; Hyphae are monokaryotic.&amp;nbsp; If compatible mononucleate hyphae(monokaryotic mycelium) meet, they exchange DNA and become polynucleate (dikaryotic).&amp;nbsp; You can't have dikaryotic hyphae as that would be like a two wheeled monocycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17313836</next>\n<prev>17312263</prev>\n<first>17266256</first>\n<last>17323023</last>\n<when>1354374622</when>\n<utime>12/01/12 05:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
