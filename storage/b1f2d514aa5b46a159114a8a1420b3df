Casing is applied to the top where fruits form, not the bottom.  Coir/verm applied to the bottom is an additional <i>substrate layer</i> however, and works fine.  It increases your substrate mass.  Both substrate and casing material should be pasteurized, not nuked or pressure cooked.  The beneficial bacteria that survive will help deliver a better pinset as well as protection from contaminant molds by keeping the material <i>alive</i>.  A sterilized substrate or casing is like a person with no immune system.  Whatever lands on it will grow.<br />RR"}}
