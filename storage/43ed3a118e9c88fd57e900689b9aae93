That doesn't say what's INside the bag?<br />I use alcohol to wash the needle, then flame sterilize.  As soon as the needle cools enough not to melt the injection site, use it.  Don't use alcohol or anything else after flaming.  If you do, you may as well skip the flaming step.  Nothing else can sterilize besides autoclaving.  Alcohol is merely a sanitizer, not a sterilizer.<br />How much air is in the top of your spawn bag?
