So a spacer is not an option. But - i've PCed and colonized w/ the same PC and with over 10 jars and it worked fine.&amp;nbsp;  Why now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the jars are tight in the pressure cooker and/or you don't use a spacer on the bottom, the jars WILL break, whether it happens the very first time or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kizzle said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need a spacer for quart jars. If the the bottoms of the jars are black it's from running out of water during sterilization. It seems likely that it was responsible for the jars cracking as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you do need a spacer with quart jars.&amp;nbsp; The stove burner is over 1000F, and if the jars are in contact with the bottom, and the tops of the jars are 800 degrees cooler, &lt;i&gt;the jars will crack&lt;/i&gt;, period.&amp;nbsp; As said above, it may not be the very first cycle, but they will crack and break, usually a ring right around the bottom of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17787974</prev>\n<first>17782294</first>\n<last>17787990</last>\n<when>1360681238</when>\n<utime>02/12/13 05:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
