Humidity tends to escape through the top; obviously this is a sealed system RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've posted at least fifty times how to build a terraium like I use, including pictures of it in operation, and the theory behind the system and how it works.  It has holes drilled into ALL SIX SIDES and is NOT a sealed system.  It appears you're not just challenged by basic physics, but reading comprehension as well.  No terrarium should EVER rain down, and anything with holes in it is NOT sealed.  Stop posting and read for a change.  If you're not interested in reading to learn, then we can't help you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6912662</prev>\n<first>6906354</first>\n<last>6913370</last>\n<when>1179158169</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 06:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
