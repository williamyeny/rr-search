{"key":"post-8420005","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8420005</id>\n<content>There's no such thing as a 'wet spot' unless your girlfriend needs something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wetspot&lt;/i&gt; is a bad slang name for various bacilli that can be stimulated by high temperature.  Sterilization is never complete, and a few endospores almost always survive.  They're not a problem if the mushroom mycelium colonizes the substrate first.  That's why I recommend colonizing in an open room at normal room temperature.  Doing so keeps your filter material dry, while providing a nice warm environment for your mycelium.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding moisture and/or heat as in a TIT type 'incubator' will increase your rate of failure.  That's a fact.  It's not a &lt;i&gt;guarantee&lt;/i&gt; of failure for sure, but will lead to increased bacteria and thermophillic mold contamination, regardless of your sterilization procedure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8423319</next>\n<prev>8419773</prev>\n<first>8418536</first>\n<last>8423729</last>\n<when>1211223894</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 10:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
