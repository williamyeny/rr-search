I came home 24 hours later to find that I had the largest fruits of any of my 5 harvests yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That indicates you had allowed your cakes to dry out.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest misting more.&amp;nbsp; You can also set the cakes in a saucer of water for 12 hours or so mid-flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16934656</next>\n<prev>16934567</prev>\n<first>16934496</first>\n<last>16934700</last>\n<when>1348970817</when>\n<utime>09/30/12 05:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
