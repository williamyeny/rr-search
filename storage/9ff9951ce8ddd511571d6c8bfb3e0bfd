With co2 being heavier than air(a mixture of oxygen, co, co2 and others) and mushrooms producing co2, which falls to the bottom of the chamber, no air displaces the co2 upwards to come in. air goes out those holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn't.&amp;nbsp; CO2 is only slightly heavier than air and mixes thoroughly with it. Thus, the air has a higher CO2 level, but the gas doesn't remain separate and fall to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a shotgun terrarium, the primary flow of air is from the bottom under the perlite, up through the perlite and into the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; This air mixes with the higher CO2 air in the terrarium, which escapes out the sides due to natural circulation. In addition to CO2, mushrooms produce heat, and the tendency of heat is to rise. The lights also produce some greenhouse-effect heating in the terrarium, relative to outside, resulting in more air flow. I've tested and measured this circulation pattern with a CO2 detector many times.&amp;nbsp; The CO2 level is lower under the terrarium than it is beside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP.&amp;nbsp; You're not supposed to be running a fan in the room.&amp;nbsp; Normal room circulation is plenty, especially if you keep a window cracked slightly open, as you should anyway for fresh air.&amp;nbsp; Large perlite is also better than small.&amp;nbsp; It's not about how much water the perlite can hold, but how much it can evaporate.&amp;nbsp; The air spaces between large perlite allow for better evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12559051</next>\n<prev>12558914</prev>\n<first>12552953</first>\n<last>12561505</last>\n<when>1273812353</when>\n<utime>05/14/10 07:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
