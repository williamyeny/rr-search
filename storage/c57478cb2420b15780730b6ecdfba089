For years, I grew mushrooms and plants in the same room with metal halide 400s.&amp;nbsp; While the color temperature of the halides is pretty low compared to fluorescent(4,000 Kelvin), the intensity of the 400 watts makes up for it.&amp;nbsp; If you're using sodium vapor lamps, they're a bit too red to give the best results, so in that case, I'd go with the fluorescent right above the fruiting chamber as shown above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8652549</prev>\n<first>8650208</first>\n<last>8652687</last>\n<when>1216433273</when>\n<utime>07/19/08 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
