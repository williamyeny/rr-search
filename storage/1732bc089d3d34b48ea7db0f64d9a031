Once egos get put aside, cakes are actually not a bad way to grow at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cakes make excellent spawn to bulk substrates.  You can use them to inoculate horse manure, coir, coffee, etc, and substantially increase yields.  However, simply breaking up cakes and adding a casing layer that has no food for the mycelium does little good, and runs the risk of destroying all your work to get to that point.  I suggest either spawning cakes to a bulk substrate or doing a dunk and roll, but forget about crumble and case.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6857905</next>\n<prev>6853915</prev>\n<first>6851473</first>\n<last>6858910</last>\n<when>1177961767</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 10:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
