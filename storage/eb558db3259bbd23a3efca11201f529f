However, it only takes a bit of light to help trigger primordia, but takes more to help them grow into pins and mature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won't use wind to help them know which way to grow. You'll use light. I put that sentence in because it's a common mistake to believe that only light determines direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the two biggest pinning triggers are full colonization, and a drop in CO2 levels, in that order.  Light is third in that list, with a steady rate of evaporation of moisture from the substrate coming in fourth.   The key to a great pinset is to harmonize all the factors so they all come at once.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many experienced growers also consider a drop in temperature important, and I respect their viewpoint.  I simply disagree as to the importance of a temperature drop when it comes to tropical species.  In the summertime, my fruiting chambers/greenhouses are typically five to ten degrees warmer than the open shelves I 'incubate' on at room temperature, so my substrates actually see an increase in temperature at fruiting time due to the heat put off by the lights.  I see no difference in pinsets at all, so I've come to the conclusion over the years that temperature is irrelevant with tropical species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, with shiitake, azurescens/p cyanescens certain oyster species, shaggy manes, agaricus, and others, you definitely need a temperature drop.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5943848</next>\n<prev>5943408</prev>\n<first>5940197</first>\n<last>24905092</last>\n<when>1155047731</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
