I've never used it with pf cakes, but others have with mixed results.  Don't use it with bulk substrates, because they're not sterilized.  Coffee exposed to contaminant spores will contaminate quicker than you can say 'oh shit'.  You can use spent coffee grinds in bulk substrates, but not liquid coffee.<br />RR"}}
