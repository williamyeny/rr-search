However, bacterial contamination causes a 'greasy' look, which is what the bottom of the one jar looks like.  My suggestion is to break the kernels up and then give them the smell test.   If they smell like fresh mushrooms, go ahead and spawn to bulk.   Since the jars are fully colonized, you can take the filter and lid off, which you'll have to do to spawn to bulk anyway.   Often, even if there's a bit of bacteria, it will do just fine, since bulk substrates are pasteurized in order to preserve the bacteria while killing off the molds.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if it smells like fresh mushrooms after breaking up the kernels, it's good to go.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7127743</next>\n<prev>7124963</prev>\n<first>7124214</first>\n<last>7127743</last>\n<when>1183517558</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 05:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
