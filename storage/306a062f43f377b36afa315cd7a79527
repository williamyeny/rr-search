Dunking will place moisture into the cake faster than the moss with much less chance of growing molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peat moss is different.  It's what we use for casing layers, usually mixed with vermiculite and buffered with lime to a ph of 7.5 to 8.  Sphagnum moss is what is used to line the basket we hang plants in to keep the soil from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5977191</next>\n<prev>5976871</prev>\n<first>5976086</first>\n<last>21668350</last>\n<when>1155959649</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 06:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
