If you're asking, pronounce it as 'auger-auger', not with the long A sound we generally use in mycology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long neck bottles or even better, something with a screw cap will work.  Don't fill it more than half way or it will likely boil over.  You'll need 20 grams of agar agar for a liter of mix.  It takes about 2/3 liter to fill a sleeve of 20 disposable dishes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8462924</prev>\n<first>8453569</first>\n<last>8463090</last>\n<when>1212162926</when>\n<utime>05/30/08 06:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
