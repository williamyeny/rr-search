Once they're fully formed mushrooms(ie pins), they grow by cell expansion, but not entirely. Basidia are single cells that produce spores at the ends of tube-like projections called sterigmata, and they're located on the gills.  A larger cap will have more basidia, thus more spores.  In other words, you'll get far more spores from a large cap than a small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we say mushrooms grow by cell expansion, it doesn't mean that &lt;i&gt;no new cells &lt;/i&gt;are produced. It means these additional cells do not directly contribute to growth.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7588415</next>\n<prev>7588069</prev>\n<first>7588040</first>\n<last>7590268</last>\n<when>1194038931</when>\n<utime>11/03/07 12:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
