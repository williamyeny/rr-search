There is no need to toss out a project over cobweb.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for manure moisture content, it should be at field capacity before you spawn it.  If it's too wet, don't spawn.  I prefer to get my manure to field capacity, then pasteurize in jars or bags, so the mix doesn't get messed up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5594816</next>\n<prev>5594392</prev>\n<first>5594062</first>\n<last>5594816</last>\n<when>1146866535</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 01:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
