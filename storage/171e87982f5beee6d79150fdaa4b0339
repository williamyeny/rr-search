I had fine verm, so had to dig through the perlite to find a piece small enough to match, or I wouldn't have been able to get them both in focus at the same time.  I'll get a picture of a larger piece later.  They're really spectacular to look at.  The camera just doesn't do them justice compared to the way they look through the binocular lenses of the microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just thought they made it very clear why we use one to evaporate moisture, and the other to store moisture.  It allows you to make a more informed answer when someone asks this question later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6614388</next>\n<prev>6613675</prev>\n<first>6610766</first>\n<last>10183124</last>\n<when>1172544356</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 04:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
