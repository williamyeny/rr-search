You're not going to get much encouragement from those of us who have grown before because we realize this isn't something to automate. I even manually control conditions in my mushroom farm.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won't be able to use transducers because they either short out or their capacitance changes at high humidity, rendering them useless.&amp;nbsp; It takes eyeballs to know when to mist, not a timer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19004115</next>\n<prev>19002519</prev>\n<first>18929917</first>\n<last>19004214</last>\n<when>1382287118</when>\n<utime>10/20/13 07:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
