{"key":"post-6579007","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6579007</id>\n<content>Size of jar doesn't affect colonization time.  Quarts/liters are best for spawn production.  Half gallon jars seem to go anaerobic too easily, and the opening on pint and half gallon jars is too large, allowing a greater chance of contaminants entering when the lid is lifted up to drop in an agar wedge.  Use narrow mouth quarts for best results with grains.  Don't fill any grain jar, regardless of size, more than 2/3 full or you'll be sorry later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6578774</prev>\n<first>6578760</first>\n<last>6579007</last>\n<when>1171754487</when>\n<utime>02/18/07 01:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
