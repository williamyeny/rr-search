Thats the sign that it is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't repeat inaccurate information.  Mushrooms thrive in 100% humidity.  Mushrooms are also 100% &lt;i&gt;composed&lt;/i&gt; of mycelium.  That's what they are.  'Fuzz' on the stems, contrary to popular myth is NOT a problem, and is NOT caused by high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony, it sounds like what you have is a genetic, strain related issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never heat a terrarium.  Run a small heater and heat the room in which it's located.  Heating a terrarium causes your humidity to turn into condensation on the walls and then your crop dries out from low humidity which IS a problem.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7608626</prev>\n<first>7608025</first>\n<last>7608703</last>\n<when>1194491986</when>\n<utime>11/08/07 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
