Fold the bag carefully along the creases, but before rolling it up, stick a sheet of tyvek or even a clean piece of cloth the length of the bag from the top to the substrate.  The cloth will allow a path for steam to escape, then as the PC cools, the plastic will draw tight and the cloth will serve as a filter until you remove the bag.  This allows people without a clean room for the PC to cool in to use bags.<br />RR"}}
