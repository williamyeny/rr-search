{"key":"post-6369340","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6369340</id>\n<content>You want to mix your quart of spawn into two to three quarts of horse manure.  Spread it no more than 1 1/2&quot; deep.  Pans don't like to fruit from deep substrates.  When fully colonized, case with 1/4&quot; of peat/verm casing mix, buffered to Ph8 to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other difference with copes over cubes is they like to fruit a bit warmer, so keep your FC at around 80F for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6369640</next>\n<prev>6368764</prev>\n<first>6368090</first>\n<last>6370041</last>\n<when>1166105659</when>\n<utime>12/14/06 04:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
