Especially if MS is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MS is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp;  I'm somewhat obsessive when it comes to these science projects and I have many years of detailed and meticulous notes on nearly every aspect of every project.&amp;nbsp; So having years worth of data to analyze I have noticed some clear patterns and thus can draw some conclusions.&amp;nbsp; And make no mistake, there is a &lt;u&gt;direct&lt;/u&gt; relationship between amount of spawn used and total yield.&amp;nbsp;  And there are very noticeable diminishing returns as you decrease your spawn to bulk ratio.&amp;nbsp;  For instance, if the identical amount of grain spawn was used for 2 tubs, and one was mixed 1:2 and the other 1:8, one tub/substrate would be 3 times size of the other, but it certainly wouldn't produce 3 times the amount of mushrooms, it wouldn't even produce double the amount.&amp;nbsp; Moral of the story:&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;don't skimp on spawn&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds to me like you're saying the moral of the story is it's OK to skimp on spawn, which is correct. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Also, multispore &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;is relevant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; because you can have dozens of strains fruiting on the same substrate, which screws up the data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get best results these days with a 1:20 spawn to bulk substrate ratio.&amp;nbsp; Most growers have a hard time with such a low spawn rate, but once you get your sterile procedures down, it's the way to go if maximizing yields is your goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the term the original poster was looking for is BE, otherwise known as Biological Efficiency.&amp;nbsp; It's the ratio of dry substrate to fresh mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; Any BE of 100% or greater is doing well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15151788</next>\n<prev>15151632</prev>\n<first>15146819</first>\n<last>16478879</last>\n<when>1317306707</when>\n<utime>09/29/11 05:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
