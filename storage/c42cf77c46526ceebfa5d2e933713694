It doesn't have enough resistance to create a pressurized plenum behind the filter, thus no laminar flow.  When you get your hands and/or jars etc., into the flow, eddies and other turbulence will occur that will force contaminants into your work.  I'd suggest running it for a few hours before working to clean the air in the room, and then shut it down just before doing the sterile work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7347606</next>\n<prev>7347256</prev>\n<first>7346495</first>\n<last>8776399</last>\n<when>1188391543</when>\n<utime>08/29/07 03:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
