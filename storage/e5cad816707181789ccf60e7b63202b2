Another mistake leading to slow colonization is putting the colonizing jars in a tub with no air circulation.&amp;nbsp; Another is keeping them in the dark.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium exposed to normal ambient room light during the day will colonize faster than the same mycelium kept in total darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a tremendous amount of flat-out wrong information about growing mushrooms floating around, and no matter how many times we try to set people straight, they find that wrong info and screw up their grows with it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12719180</next>\n<prev>12719057</prev>\n<first>12713352</first>\n<last>12720873</last>\n<when>1276169169</when>\n<utime>06/10/10 02:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
