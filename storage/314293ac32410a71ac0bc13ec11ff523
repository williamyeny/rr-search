Dikaryons colonize and feed much faster than monokaryons.  By shaking, you disperse the ungerminated spores over a larger area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to inject, and then let the jars or bags sit for several days until you see germination, or if you inoculate with an agar wedge, wait until the mycelium has moved off the wedge and into the grains before shaking.  If you do the above, only one shake is required during the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7233412</next>\n<prev>7227647</prev>\n<first>7227598</first>\n<last>7648667</last>\n<when>1185500739</when>\n<utime>07/27/07 04:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
