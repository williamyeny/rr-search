Just set it on some blocks or PVC pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the video showed, elevate the jars completely out of the water.  This prevents it from splashing up and under the foil, then getting into the jars.  The steam will sterilize the brown rice flour cakes, but you'll need a kettle with a nice fitting lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the water boils, turn down the stove to the minimum setting that will keep the water boiling.  This will make your water last longer.   Check on it after an hour, you might need to add a glass or two of water to keep from boiling dry.  I recommend 90 minutes, but don't start counting the time until steam is beginning to escape from the lid and you turn the stove down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my video from the sounds of it.  Roadkill did the mixing and most of the talking on the brf tek section.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7199029</next>\n<prev>7198838</prev>\n<first>7198629</first>\n<last>7199208</last>\n<when>1184889169</when>\n<utime>07/20/07 02:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
