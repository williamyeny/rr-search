You want to remove the dust and chaff from the grains so they don't clump up and stick together later.  After the soak, simmer in the soak water to kill off the bacteria that has germinated before you pour it down your sink.  This will help keep your sink drain from stinking.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I use weak coffee to soak rye berries every time. It's not for potency or yield, but for speed and vigor in colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5841407</prev>\n<first>5841326</first>\n<last>5841613</last>\n<when>1152539216</when>\n<utime>07/10/06 04:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
