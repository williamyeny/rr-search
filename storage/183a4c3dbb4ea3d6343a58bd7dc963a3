It can take up to an hour to kill mold spores, and you're unlikely to still have a proper temperature after that long unless you insulate the bucket, but then there's still the problem of the beneficial microbes being killed by the boiling water in the first few minutes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should moisten the substrate to field capacity, and then gently heat to 140F to 160F, as measured at the center of the substrate with a meat thermometer and then maintain that temp for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.&amp;nbsp; You can see a short video clip of the process being done with casing material on my website in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Casing-Layer-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;casing prep tek&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Prepare your coir that way next time and you'll be more likely to get the mycelium to jump right off the grains and colonize the substrate before molds have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11820360</next>\n<prev>11815912</prev>\n<first>11812674</first>\n<last>11863776</last>\n<when>1263337591</when>\n<utime>01/13/10 01:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
