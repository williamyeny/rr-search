With some species, it's required for fruits to form.  With cubes, a casing layer is optional, but unless you have a way of maintaining nearly 100% humidity at the substrate level, it's hard to get a really good pinset.  With tray culture, a sheet of wax paper can help, but the other job of a casing layer is to supply moisture for the flush, which wax paper can not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two plusses for uncased substrates is they are contaminant resistant, where often the uncolonized portions of a casing layer can become contaminated, and you get fruits sooner when not waiting for a casing layer to colonize before initiating pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With uncased substrates(or cased for that matter), you can use a syringe to inject water into the interior.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5743829</next>\n<prev>5743748</prev>\n<first>5740009</first>\n<last>5745608</last>\n<when>1150168921</when>\n<utime>06/13/06 06:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
