Just make it a policy not to sniff to check for contaminants unless through a filter.  Don't eat any molds either, even though most are harmless.  If a bit of green shows up on a cake or casing just as you're harvesting, don't sweat it.  The fruits themselves are still ok.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5411500</prev>\n<first>5409266</first>\n<last>5411729</last>\n<when>1142608850</when>\n<utime>03/17/06 05:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
