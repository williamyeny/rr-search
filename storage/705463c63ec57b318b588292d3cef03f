It's been a long time since someone sent me for a dictionary. Cheers for that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn't say elderly ladies.&amp;nbsp; I said little girls, and very, very little girls, referring to those too scared to eat more than the amount of mushrooms a church mouse would eat.&amp;nbsp; Maria believed in eating enough mushrooms to have a life-changing experience, and I totally agree.&amp;nbsp; Just be at home or in the woods, but not at a party, or where you have to drive, or otherwise be around people.&amp;nbsp; Dogs make excellent guardians while tripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trip reports&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trips are private, internal affairs.&amp;nbsp; I don't write trip reports, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, all this talk about B+ this, or GT that, is just nonsense talk.&amp;nbsp; Strains don't come in spores.&amp;nbsp; Every grow from spores is going to generate a different strain, regardless of marketing to the contrary.&amp;nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, many thousands of which emerge from a single swipe of spores.&amp;nbsp; This is why experienced growers learn to isolate strains, and why we banished 'strain' talk to that unmoderated bastard step-child of a 'strain thread' sticky at the top of the page.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15722972</next>\n<prev>15722775</prev>\n<first>15721076</first>\n<last>15723266</last>\n<when>1327641496</when>\n<utime>01/27/12 07:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
