If it has a 400 watt setting, that would be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never use a heating pad to heat a fruiting chamber, because the temperature differential will cause all your humidity to condense on the sides of the FC.  Use a heater to heat the entire area if necessary.  Low 70's is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6177713</next>\n<prev>6177564</prev>\n<first>6176992</first>\n<last>6178109</last>\n<when>1161093201</when>\n<utime>10/17/06 04:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
