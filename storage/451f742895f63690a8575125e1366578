Dump into your terrarium, and you'll have 99% humidity within an hour or two.  Damp perlite prepared as above will maintain that 99% in a terrarium for thirty days or so, at which time you repeat the process.  Any standing water will lower the humidity by reducing the surface area of the perlite that is exposed to the air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5898792</next>\n<prev>5898625</prev>\n<first>5898605</first>\n<last>5898883</last>\n<when>1153865517</when>\n<utime>07/26/06 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
