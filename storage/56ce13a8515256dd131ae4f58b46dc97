In addition, even fluorescents put out a lot of heat from the ballast and will quickly overheat a fruiting chamber.  You can have the light behind and to the top of the tub, where it shines in the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative is to fruit them on an open shelf with wax paper layed over the top.  If you'll just run a humidifier in your room to get the humidity up to 50% or better, cased substrates do well in the open air, provided you use wax paper.  Let the fruits push the wax paper out of the way as they grow.  Change it out for a fresh sheet every second day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6549116</next>\n<prev>6548459</prev>\n<first>6548459</first>\n<last>6550775</last>\n<when>1171085341</when>\n<utime>02/10/07 07:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
