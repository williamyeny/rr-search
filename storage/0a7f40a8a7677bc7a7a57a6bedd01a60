Penicillium is a blue mold and very rare in our world.  It can be found in your kitchen on cheese and bread though whenever it molds.  Sometimes I see it on agar, but In my experience, it has never popped up in jars or substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5577805</prev>\n<first>5577805</first>\n<last>5580605</last>\n<when>1146577438</when>\n<utime>05/02/06 04:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
