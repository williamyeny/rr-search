I sleep in my grow room, (or grow in my bedroom) so was exposed to a sporedrop one whole night when I was too tired to harvest, and put it off til the next morning.  That's what did it.  Those things put out a massive spore drop, unlike anything else.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what that same flush did to my mini-greenhouse AC unit, and this is only what made it through the super allergen furnace filter that was in the return air line.  I had to throw away the entire ducting system and build it again from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-52/743652096-mini-greenhouse_AC_with_Oyster_spores_005a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-52/743652096-thumb_mini-greenhouse_AC_with_Oyster_spores_005a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6772874</next>\n<prev>6772639</prev>\n<first>6769177</first>\n<last>6773360</last>\n<when>1176263006</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 06:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
