Fruits from some strains are very securely attached to the casing layer or substrate, and others seem to be barely there.  The former leaves a large divit when you pick, the latter you can barely tell where the fruits were after you pick.<br />I have no idea on the light mushies unless the substrate is oversaturated or something.<br />RR"}}
