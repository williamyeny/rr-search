With the lid askew as I suggested, it will maintain mid 90% range.  As cc said, FAE is the prevention for contaminants.  Aquarium pumps won't be near enough, although cubes are very tolerant of high CO2 concentrations, but you need an actual breeze if you want to see no green.  When I grow pf tek oysters in a terrarium, I leave the lid(with two dozen holes drilled into it) on until pinning begins, then take it totally off for the next week until harvest.<br />RR"}}
