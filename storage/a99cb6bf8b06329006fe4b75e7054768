It's not to save energy or protect the environment. It's so the government can spy on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All new fluorescent light bulbs have microchips, microphones and even microcameras implanted inside them. These devices record audio and/or video whenever a key word is spoken during a conversation or whenever a large movement occurs in a room.&quot; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mushroom2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot; title=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who the hell do you think is going to buy into that crap?&amp;nbsp; That's just plain bullshit. If the government wants to tap your phone or bug your house, they'll do it.&amp;nbsp; However, they don't bug fluorescent lights sold in stores to spy on people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFLs use a tiny fraction of the electricity an incandescent bulb uses to produce the same amount of light.&amp;nbsp; If you buy a CFL for mushroom growing, look for one that says 6,500 K on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8012396</next>\n<prev>8012374</prev>\n<first>8004249</first>\n<last>8012456</last>\n<when>1202830278</when>\n<utime>02/12/08 05:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
