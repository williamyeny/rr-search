He isn't growing button mushrooms for the grocery store. While dim room light might be enough for a few &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; pins to develop, bright high frequency light such as is recommended, and the original poster is using, is perfect to develop a stellar, stunning pinset and flush.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium requires bright light to form abundant primordia, and the developing fruits need a regular light schedule all the way to harvest for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's normal as you've experienced for the mycelium to partially envelop the vermiculite.&amp;nbsp; Keep it well misted, and provide plenty of air exchange.&amp;nbsp; I'm no fan of the pmp either.&amp;nbsp; Some (sub)strains will do OK in them, but most require much more fresh air than an air pump can supply.&amp;nbsp; It's more than just getting rid of the CO2-It's about &lt;i&gt;fresh air&lt;/i&gt;, which fruiting mushrooms love.&amp;nbsp; I'd fan the terrarium out whenever you can.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8913236</next>\n<prev>8906155</prev>\n<first>8904724</first>\n<last>8913236</last>\n<when>1221062577</when>\n<utime>09/10/08 07:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
