By 'blue' light, we mean light at the high end of the color temperature spectrum, measured in Kelvin.  You'll want to cut a square in the top of that tub and glue a piece of clear Plexiglas or lay a sheet of window glass over it. Best would be to use a piece of clear Plexiglas over the entire top to replace the pink lid. Use a fluorescent lamp, or place the tub near a window for natural lighting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7010894</next>\n<prev>7008732</prev>\n<first>7008562</first>\n<last>7010894</last>\n<when>1181006430</when>\n<utime>06/05/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
