In fact, they're killed off by temperatures far below boiling.  We don't use a pressure cooker to avoid green molds.  Boiling alone would do that.  We use a pc against bacteria.  If you followed even basic PC instructions, you can be sure you introduced the mold when you inoculated.  Either your print, the syringe, the water or the needle were dirty, or all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5590606</prev>\n<first>5582946</first>\n<last>5590628</last>\n<when>1146781499</when>\n<utime>05/05/06 01:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
