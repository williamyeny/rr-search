If they're loose, there's a chance that contaminants will be drawn into the jar as the PC cools at the end of the cycle.  Air in the jar won't expand and need to escape because the air in the pressure cooker is under the same pressure, thus it's equalized.<br />It's best to let steam escape for a few minutes before placing the weight on or closing the toggle if it's a sterilizer, but don't let it go too long.   Anytime steam is escaping from the PC, it's also letting moisture escape from your jars.  If the PC is blowing steam wildly, it's also blowing steam wildly from your jars, possibly blowing the filter material and/or drying out your grains.  This is the reason you never want to pop the weight off at the end of the cycle to let the steam out.<br />I suggest closing the toggle or placing the weight on the PC when the pressure reads 2 to 3 psi, or if you PC doesn't have a guage, put the weight on after three to five minutes of steam venting.  Have the lids tight.<br />RR"}}
