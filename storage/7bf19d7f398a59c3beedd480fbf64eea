If you're growing agaricus, leave it in the refrigerator for two or three days for a good cold shock.  Cold weather edibles fruit in the fall after the cold weather sets in, which is their pinning trigger to set fruitbodies to reproduce.<br />Warm weather dung and straw loving mushrooms fruit all summer, even in 95F weather, so a cold shock isn't possibly one of their pinning triggers.  They fruit in response to full colonization, a decrease in CO2 levels, with a corresponding increase in fresh air supply, a slow but steady rate of moisture loss from the substrate, and light, with the level of importance pretty much in that order.  <br />Therefore, a mushroom that fruits in Florida in July should not be cold shocked.<br />RR"}}
