The foil could keep the filter material damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method is metal lid goes on first, metal side down instead of rubber side down so it's easier to get off later, then the filter disk, then the ring.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three 1/16&quot; holes are plenty.  You don't need air exchange with grain jars, you only require gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5874243</prev>\n<first>5870184</first>\n<last>5875333</last>\n<when>1153278465</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
