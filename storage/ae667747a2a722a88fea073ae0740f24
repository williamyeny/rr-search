I have holes and slits cut all over it, and the door is a 7' square hole cut into the front, with an 8' sheet of plastic hanging down loosely(no zipper) inside the hole, so an opening for air exchange runs from floor to ceiling on both sides.  I'm running two coolmists inside, so I can cut the time they run in half, lowering the water dripping problem.  I also fill up any empty shelf space and the entire floor area with trays of damp perlite, so I'm able to maintain humidity in the upper nineties with constant air exchange.<br />I don't recommend running hoses from an impeller type cool mist because the static pressure that develops forces mist into the motor and motor bushings, ruining them after a short time.  The two I have inside the greenhouse have been running for over a year without replacement.<br />RR"}}
