It's not to tell them which way to grow. As for the original question in this thread, lighting should not be cut back once pinning starts.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13720036</next>\n<prev>13718019</prev>\n<first>13684454</first>\n<last>13720036</last>\n<when>1293986725</when>\n<utime>01/02/11 06:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
