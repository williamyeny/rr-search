{"key":"post-8152587","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8152587</id>\n<content>Manure is not a plant food.  Plants have no direct use for manure.  Manure feeds the soil, and then &lt;i&gt;organisms&lt;/i&gt; in the soil, such as &lt;i&gt;fungi&lt;/i&gt; break it down, creating 'plant food'.  Blood and bone meal also have no benefit to fungi in my experience.  I still fail to see why we'd want to increase the nitrogen levels of a substrate such as manure or coir, which perform exactly the same whether blood meal is added or not.  People still seem to think mycelium is some sort of plant that needs to be 'fertilized', when in reality mycelium &lt;i&gt;creates&lt;/i&gt; fertilizer from manure, coir, newspapers, cardboard, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8152641</next>\n<prev>8149897</prev>\n<first>8128686</first>\n<last>8152841</last>\n<when>1205677077</when>\n<utime>03/16/08 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
