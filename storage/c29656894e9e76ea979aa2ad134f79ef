The fuzz on the stem is fine, and doesn't mean humidity is too high.  It seems to happen with some strains/substrains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll wrinkle up the wax paper into a ball, and then flatten it back out again before use, the wrinkles will decrease the amount of wax paper in contact with the caps as they push it out of the way.  This will help prevent moisture building up in the cap-wax paper interface.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7007311</next>\n<prev>7007283</prev>\n<first>7007283</first>\n<last>7007311</last>\n<when>1180978821</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
