You won't have any outlets already that it can be connected to since it won't run on a 20 amp circuit, and that's what most houses have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also looks like you'd have to turn it sideways and remove your door to get it into the house, provided you have a 36&quot; door.&amp;nbsp; Most front residential doors don't swing a full 180, so unless yours does, you'd probably need to at least pop the hinges and take the door off.&amp;nbsp; Most bedroom doors are only 32&quot; to 34&quot;, so you couldn't put it in a spare room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12524946</next>\n<prev>12524247</prev>\n<first>12506680</first>\n<last>12525051</last>\n<when>1273286966</when>\n<utime>05/08/10 05:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
