You can install a fitting between the greenhouse and your fans intake to mix in some fresh air, and let the rest recirculate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agar is correct about not needing that kind of filtration in a fruiting environment.  I have a similar setup, feeding fresh air in the bottom of the greenhouse by my humidifiers, and taking the return air vent out the top of the greenhouse.  The only filter I use is a screen to protect my blower motor bearings from when I fail to harvest in time and clog the system up with spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6337035</next>\n<prev>6336968</prev>\n<first>6336887</first>\n<last>6337074</last>\n<when>1165357919</when>\n<utime>12/06/06 12:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
