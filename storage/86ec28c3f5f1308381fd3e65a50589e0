If your grow area is far below that, the pins will form along the edges where the humidity is higher.  Another cause of side pinning is if you used too much lime in the casing mix.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7406467</next>\n<prev>7406133</prev>\n<first>7398713</first>\n<last>7413469</last>\n<when>1189739339</when>\n<utime>09/14/07 06:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
