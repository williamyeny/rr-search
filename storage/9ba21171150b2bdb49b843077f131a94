You could probably use 50 year old spores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked for two full years trying to get 20 year old spores to germinate.  NOTHING worked, and trust me, I tried every trick I have up my sleeve.  I was able to get the genetics from the spores without them ever germinating, but that's all been detailed in the 'redboy' thread in advanced mycology from a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6867405</next>\n<prev>6866613</prev>\n<first>6862708</first>\n<last>7014386</last>\n<when>1178210463</when>\n<utime>05/03/07 07:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
