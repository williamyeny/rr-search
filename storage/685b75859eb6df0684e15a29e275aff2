We use agar to transfer the healthy mycelium away from the naturally occuring contaminants.  As the agar cools after pouring into petri dishes, it shrinks, drawing in contaminants from the air, which is full of bacteria and mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important to wrap your petri dishes with parafilm as soon as they solidify after pouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see contamination developing in a petri dish, immediately transfer any good mycelium away from the contaminated dish into a fresh one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will help to use a filtered flask for PC'ing your agar to avoid contaminants being drawn into the flask as it cools.  Allow the agar to cool until it's nearly solidified before pouring.  This will cut down on the temperature differential between inside and outside the petri dishes, reducing the amount of contaminants drawn in as the dishes finish cooling.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6085543</next>\n<prev>6081306</prev>\n<first>6081306</first>\n<last>6086826</last>\n<when>1158763774</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 05:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
