He'll have next to no adjustment range. I it'll act pretty much like an on/off switch.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made one with a 50K and it was like an on/off switch, but I still could just barely, and I mean barely control the speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, a 10K would have been perfect, but still might have been too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try 100 ohms maximum.&amp;nbsp; This will actually give control.&amp;nbsp; Make sure it can dissipate 24 Watts or so.&amp;nbsp; If the fan needs 2.5 amps at full speed, it's doubtful a 1 amp power supply will be able to drive it without the voltage dropping too much.&amp;nbsp; Look for a larger power supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks FunnyLight for providing an accurate answer.&amp;nbsp; I always see these threads and marvel at those who would power a 12 volt DC device with 120 VAC, or use a dimmer to control an AC motor rather than a motor speed controller.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18946329</next>\n<prev>18891044</prev>\n<first>18847526</first>\n<last>18948974</last>\n<when>1380167523</when>\n<utime>09/26/13 06:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
