Personally, I go for constant 24/7 air exchange, keeping CO2 levels at ambient.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That substrate doesn't look too good.&amp;nbsp; Keep an eye on it.&amp;nbsp; Mist to prevent drying and try laying a sheet of wax paper over it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13739927</next>\n<prev>13739438</prev>\n<first>13739084</first>\n<last>13752674</last>\n<when>1294324456</when>\n<utime>01/06/11 04:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
