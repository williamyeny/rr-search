Reduce incubation temps to 75F to 81F or you're encouraging bacteria and molds rather than mushroom mycelium.<br />Cloning from dry tissue generally requires agar skills and several transfers to separate what mycelium is likely to grow, away from contaminants.  In addition, dry tissue should be washed well with 10% iodine solution and then soaked in sterilized distilled water for a few weeks prior to attempting to use.<br />Sorry, but I can't give your experiment much chance of success with those methods.<br />RR"}}
