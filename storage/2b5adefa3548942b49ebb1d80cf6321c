For growing cubensis, coir is the equal of horse manure.&nbsp; I don't want to hear about 'nutes', because mushrooms aren't plants.&nbsp; Every time I hear about NPK or 'Nitrogen', the hair on my neck stands up.&nbsp; The biggest and best mushrooms grow on straw.&nbsp; Any idea what the NPK of uncomposted straw is?<br />2. Nobody knows how P cubensis spread around the world.&nbsp; There's only speculation, and that's like opinions and assholes, which everyone has.&nbsp; They could have come with the cattle, or they could have come on the wind, or they could have evolved where ever they're found, including the Americas.&nbsp; Just because there's no written records from the native Americans who didn't write, doesn't mean they weren't here, whether they ate them or not.<br />3. Mushroom spores can survive a cow's stomach.&nbsp; That's one of the ways they're spread.&nbsp; Ever use non-composted cow or horse manure in a garden?&nbsp; It's full of weed seeds which sprout and grow.&nbsp; Spores do the same.&nbsp; It's also common for spores to land on the grass and then a cow dumps on them.&nbsp; There's more than one means of dispersal."}}
