Many folks report 'overlay' with coir, when what is actually happening is by using coir they've actually added a second substrate layer. Peat is non-nutritious and better suited for use as a casing.  I'd also recommend mixing it 50/50 with verm.  Lime at 5% of the peat by volume if you're using hydrated lime.  As said above, trich and cobweb really hate a high ph, while mushroom mycelium tolerates it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4615534</next>\n<prev>4614604</prev>\n<first>4613375</first>\n<last>4615534</last>\n<when>1125724421</when>\n<utime>09/03/05 08:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
