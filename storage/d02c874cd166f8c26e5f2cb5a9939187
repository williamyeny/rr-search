Pouring hot water on a substrate is not pasteurization.&amp;nbsp; Pasteurization involves fully hydrating the substrate to field capacity, and then loading into bags or jars.&amp;nbsp; Insert a meat thermometer in the center of the mass, and slowly heat the substrate to 140F and hold it there for 60 to 90 minutes.&amp;nbsp; For best results, make sure the substrate never exceeds 160F at any time in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you supplement with coffee grinds, you must use &lt;b&gt;spent&lt;/b&gt; coffee grinds, not fresh. In other words, brew a pot of coffee with it first.&amp;nbsp; If you use fresh, you're brewing liquid coffee into your substrate, and liquid coffee will be green within days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13092448</next>\n<prev>13092372</prev>\n<first>13091743</first>\n<last>13092448</last>\n<when>1282614152</when>\n<utime>08/24/10 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
