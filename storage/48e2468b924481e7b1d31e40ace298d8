The objectives on the M2 are probably double the diameter of the objectives on the student microscopes.  This lets in a lot more light, even though both have the same 'power'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6614255</next>\n<prev>6614112</prev>\n<first>6613857</first>\n<last>6647565</last>\n<when>1172546705</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 05:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
