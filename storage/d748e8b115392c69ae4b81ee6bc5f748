For outdoor beds, gypsum is always nice as a source of calcium and sulphur, but ph is not as important as inside where we're trying to discourage molds.  If you're growing on compost outside, the ph should be fine without liming.  If you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to raise the ph, add lime, to lower the ph, add peat moss and/or coffee grinds.  Sulphur will also lower ph.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6036343</next>\n<prev>6036051</prev>\n<first>6035992</first>\n<last>6040274</last>\n<when>1157592381</when>\n<utime>09/07/06 04:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
