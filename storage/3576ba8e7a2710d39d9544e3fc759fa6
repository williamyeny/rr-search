You do NOT count the vermiculite when figuring how much lime to use.  As you were told above, vermiculite is inert.  Peat has a ph of 4 to 6, and that's why we use lime.  You mix the dry lime and gypsum with the dry peat, then add moisture.  Then you add moisture to the vermiculite, THEN you mix the two together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is the correct way to make a casing layer.  Adjust ph to 8 to 8.5 prior to pasteurization using however much lime or oyster shell flour is necessary.  Any amounts given above or in teks are suggestions/starting points.  What you need is what it takes for your ph strips to read 8 to 8.5&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6164312</prev>\n<first>6160806</first>\n<last>6164357</last>\n<when>1160717422</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 08:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
