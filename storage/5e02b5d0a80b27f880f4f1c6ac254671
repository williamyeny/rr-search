If you're going to scrape off the top part of the casing layer, why not just make it less deep to begin with?  In addition, anything you do to mess with the mycelium sets it back and allows contaminants a chance to get a foothold as the mycelium is trying to recover.  Undoubtedly, some of the cobweb and/or trich spores that were sitting harmlessly on the surface got stirred into what casing material was left, so now they're proteced and can easily germinate and take over.<br />A technique that stamets teaches is to allow the casing layer to partly colonize, then scratch it up to distribute the mycelium throughout the casing, thereby speeding up the process.  When I've tried this, it only set things back, but I tried it on cubes, not agaricus.<br />It probably doesn't need to be repeated again here, but plain verm has to be the worst possible choice for a casing layer.  I've found little benefit to casing cubensis bulk substrates anyway, but if all you're using is verm to hydrate the substrate, it's easier and faster to either dunk or simply pour water in around the edges and mist the top gently and forget the casing layer altogether.<br />However, experimenting is how we develop new teks and learn, so go for it and keep us posted.  Good luck!<br />RR"}}
