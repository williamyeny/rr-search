Give the metal a little while to warm up evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caution statement probably refers to burners that could melt the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&amp;nbsp; The pressure cooker can't heat up faster than the water inside.&amp;nbsp; Use high setting on your stove from the start until pressure is reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12,000 BTU limit is because if more than that is used, the vent can't release all the steam being produced, thus the pressure would continue to rise until the unit blew up, if left unattended.&amp;nbsp; An indoor stove burner will be smaller than 12K BTU.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14029398</next>\n<prev>14029121</prev>\n<first>14028728</first>\n<last>14029398</last>\n<when>1298732623</when>\n<utime>02/26/11 05:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
