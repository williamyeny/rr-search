Three to five inches of well drained perlite will maintain humidity in a terrarium full of holes for six weeks to two months without adding water.  Second, perlite is a crystalline mineral that doesn't absorb water, so it would NOT absorb water in 24 hours, or 24 years.  Perlite that is under water may as well not be there.
