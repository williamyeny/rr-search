If you want to isolate stains, you'll need at least a couple of dozen to get down to single sector isolates.  If you're just trying to isolate away from contaminants, you'll still go through a lot of dishes.  Pre-sterilized plastic petri dishes in a sterlile sleeve of 20 can be purchased for a dime each.   You can't wash and/or sterilize glass dishes and especially jars for that.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6239141</next>\n<prev>6238579</prev>\n<first>6238227</first>\n<last>6239501</last>\n<when>1162497395</when>\n<utime>11/02/06 09:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
