Mist the walls whenever condensation looks low. Don't mist cakes or perlite, be careful with perlite, you can get pools of water built up, that's bad news. </blockquote><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\":facepalm:\"/> <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\":facepalm:\"/>&nbsp; That's a two facepalm rated reply.&nbsp; Since condensation doesn't form on shotgun terrariums, you don't mist the walls to simulate it.&nbsp; What you <b>DO</b> mist is the cakes and perlite.&nbsp; Perlite will never build up pools because it's like gravel.&nbsp; The water will drain right through.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>TheFog said:</strong><br />Even better, put a fan in the room aimed away from the tub. Constant FAE, even at that small amount, will yield much more. Keep fanning with this so long as you keep humidity up. </blockquote><br />Never use a fan in the room with a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; It will screw up the natural air currents the terrarium is engineered to function by. This has been known for a decade.<br />Perhaps you should take a break from handing out advice until you've actually done a grow or two. . .please.<br />RR"}}
