Sometimes we say the same thing by phrasing it as 'fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger' because a constant supply of fresh air causes drying of the substrate.&amp;nbsp; This loss of moisture from the substrate must be replaced by misting, dunking, or some other method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put a substrate where it can wick a constant supply of water from geolite, perlite, or water, etc., pinning performance will be poor because the substrate will saturate or waterlog.&amp;nbsp; You want your substrate to begin to dry out. . .and then replace that water, before allowing it to dry out again.&amp;nbsp; That's the way to best performance.&amp;nbsp; Use foil, jar lids, etc., to separate the cakes from the geolite or perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10928764</next>\n<prev>10155789</prev>\n<first>10155789</first>\n<last>10928764</last>\n<when>1239607554</when>\n<utime>04/13/09 10:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
