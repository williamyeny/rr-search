We got up yesterday at 4 AM to watch the meteor shower.&amp;nbsp; My neighbor down the road about 1/2 mile built a two story observatory with a retractable roof and we spent a few hours there last week.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9545151</next>\n<prev>9544646</prev>\n<first>9532253</first>\n<last>9553678</last>\n<when>1231113565</when>\n<utime>01/05/09 01:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
