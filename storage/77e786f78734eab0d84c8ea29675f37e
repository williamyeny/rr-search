The first, PF Tek, went to bad genetics except one jar which got bacterial contamination during colonization. We also believe we handled them too much, and once the jars were dropped due to a faulty shelf. None-the-less 3/4 jars grew nothing but over-sized aborts even though we followed PF tek procedures stringently.</blockquote><br />If you were following the original pf tek, that explains it.&nbsp; You should follow the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek</a> on your next grow before moving to grains and bulk substrates without having the basics down.&nbsp; The pf/brf tek is the fastest and most foolproof way to go from spores to fruits.<br />I wouldn't recommend anyone to sterilize one jar at at time, especially laying down in the water on its side with polyfill in the center hole.&nbsp; Go to a thrift store and get a used pressure cooker for 20 bucks, or stick with the brf tek until you get the procedures down.<br />RR"}}
