If none of them have it, I'll post a link to a hardware store that sells hydrated garden lime online. Be sure you get hydrated &lt;i&gt;garden&lt;/i&gt; lime.  If you go to an industrial supply, they'll sell you hydrated lime for steel and concrete making which is many levels of magnitude stonger and will mess up your ph. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to pasteurize the casing mix.  Left untreated it will contaminate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5687247</next>\n<prev>5687162</prev>\n<first>5686085</first>\n<last>5687247</last>\n<when>1148941053</when>\n<utime>05/30/06 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
