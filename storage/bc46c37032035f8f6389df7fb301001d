CO2 is heavier than air, but not much denser, so it doesn't drain the way water would.  It will still build up even with holes.  Fan as often as you think of it, but at least several times per day for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6662587</next>\n<prev>6662533</prev>\n<first>6662533</first>\n<last>6662870</last>\n<when>1173747636</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
