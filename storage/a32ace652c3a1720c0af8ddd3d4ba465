Make sure they're dry, then crush into your peat before hydrating.  Lime as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest cause of trichoderma in bulk projects is improper air exchange, not filtering or sterility.  It should be assumed that the massive air exchange during fruiting admits contaminants.  The key is to not only have fresh air, but moving air.  Contaminants thrive in stale, still air.  Moving, fresh air stimulates mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6391609</next>\n<prev>6390029</prev>\n<first>6387622</first>\n<last>6391609</last>\n<when>1166650656</when>\n<utime>12/20/06 11:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
