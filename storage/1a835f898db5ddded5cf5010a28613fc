This is one of the old myths perpetuated by stamets 'The Mushroom Cultivator', that was incorrect 20 years ago when it was written.  He corrected his own mistake in GGMM, but fewer people have read that one because it centers more on edibles, than on psilocybe mushrooms.  My own research says light doesn't make one whit of difference to colonizing mycelium in jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time to protect from light is during spawn run of bulk substrates and casing layers.  During the initial colonization of grains or brf cakes, it doesn't matter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7005077</next>\n<prev>7004543</prev>\n<first>7003840</first>\n<last>7006568</last>\n<when>1180919762</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 04:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
