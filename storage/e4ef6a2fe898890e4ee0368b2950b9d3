If you had used your syringe to inoculate jars of grains, you'd be very close to fruiting mushrooms by now, OR the jars would have turned green and you'd know there was a problem, which you can't see in LC.  <br />You can use 9/10 of a jar of rye grain to lay in a tray for casing, then use the other 1/10 of the jar to make 20 or more mycelium syringes.  Simply pour a pint(or more) of sterilized, distilled water into the jar that is 1/10 full of colonized grains.  Shake well, then draw the solution into syringes.  This procedure gives a very fast method of getting liquid mycelium syringes and fruits at the same time.   Simply squirting spores into sugar water is a very poor and inefficient method of making liquid culture syringes and is drastically slowing down the progress of everyone using it.    There's far better methods.<br />RR"}}
