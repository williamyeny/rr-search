Making dark syringes is a gimmick to sell bunk product to noobs.&amp;nbsp; At least one vendor adds carbon/charcoal to the syringes to make them look dark. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt; to the letter on your first grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;truskool said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covering the holes with masking tape is a no no also using rubber bands to hold the foil down is also unnecessary.&amp;nbsp; You might have limited the steam getting into the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam NEVER enters the jars.&amp;nbsp; The steam is what transfers heat to the jars, but does not penetrate.&amp;nbsp; Pressure always travels from high to low, and the jars are always at the same pressure as the rest of the pressure cooker, thus steam does not enter.&amp;nbsp; If it did, it would condense back to water and ruin the moisture content, but this obviously doesn't happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover the holes with micropore tape, which is breathable.&amp;nbsp; You inject right through it, and can leave it in place after inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't go into detail on all the other mistakes because they're covered in the video.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16060362</next>\n<prev>16059978</prev>\n<first>16059007</first>\n<last>16064613</last>\n<when>1333894174</when>\n<utime>04/08/12 05:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
