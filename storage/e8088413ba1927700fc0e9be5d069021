I buy them by the thousands and have to have them shipped 2,000 miles.&amp;nbsp; They're easy to get. Simply order from one of our sponsors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oven bags are three or four times the cost of autoclave bags, and they don't have filter patches.&amp;nbsp; They're also less than half the thickness, which is why they tear and otherwise fail so often.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11905741</next>\n<prev>11905651</prev>\n<first>11905081</first>\n<last>11905754</last>\n<when>1264540370</when>\n<utime>01/26/10 11:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
