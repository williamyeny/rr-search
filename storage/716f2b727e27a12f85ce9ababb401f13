{"key":"post-6846431","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6846431</id>\n<content>Consider an ambient temperature of 81F maximum.  The mycelium will produce a few degrees on its own, so if a pf jar you can go as high as 81.  If a grain jar, go as high as 78F, and if a large filter patch spawn bag, don't go much over 75F for best results.  There's a lot of disinformation floating around out there, so you have to learn to wade through the bs. Post a picture of that jar in a few days, but I don't like the looks of that mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6844728</prev>\n<first>6833275</first>\n<last>6846431</last>\n<when>1177808580</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 04:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
