{"key":"post-3914406","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3914406</id>\n<content>My experience with fungus gnats is they are breeding in your houseplants, and the adults are attracted to your myclium for a meal. It's rare to have them attempt to breed/nest in a casing. The larvae can be treated with a BT that's specific to fungus gnats. I've used this one on my houseplants to knock out the maggots. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gardensalive.com/product.asp?pn=1962&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.gardensalive.com/product.asp?pn=1962&lt;/a&gt;  Of course, the sticky traps help too.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3915404</next>\n<prev>3914239</prev>\n<first>3911432</first>\n<last>3915404</last>\n<when>1110784641</when>\n<utime>03/14/05 09:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
