I certainly hope it wasn't a shroomery vendor.  They should know better.<br />Unless you're growing agaricus, nothing I know that grows on cow manure appreciates being cold shocked.  Cubes certainly don't, and certainly not three days after spawning a poor substrate such as bagged cow manure.  It will need at least a week to colonize.<br />You need far more than one air exchange per day to initiate fruiting.  Four to five air exchanges per HOUR are recommended.<br />I would suggest you mix your pf cakes into the bulk substrate material by birthing the cakes and then smashing them up inside a zip lock bag.  Lay a bit of manure in the tray, then sprinkle a bit of your spawn over it, then a bit more manure, and a bit more spawn.  Layer it like that until the tray is full.  Cover it with aluminum foil, not a plastic lid.  The foil will keep the light off of it while the manure colonizes.  Poke two or three nail sized holes in the foil for gas exchange but no more.  It will need a week to ten days to colonize if you spawn at a rate of three or four to one.  Let it colonize at room temperature, not in an incubator.<br />When the manure is colonized, apply your casing layer.  Do NOT pack it down!  That's even more horrible advice than the cold shocking part before casing!  Sprinkle your casing on as light and fluffy as you can make it, and then cover the tray again with foil for a few days.  When you see perhaps ten to twenty percent of the casing layer colonized, expose to fruiting conditions as suggested on this site.  Hyphae's pinning strategy is an excellent place to start.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
