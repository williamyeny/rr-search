And he is not grinding it anymore, just buying powdered commercial agar agar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch the full tek on DVD rather than just the sample clips, you'll see I was demonstrating with Stamets' pre-mixed agar from fungi.com and the recipe calls for 49 grams(7 tablespoons) per liter of water.&amp;nbsp; That pre-mixed agar already contains the agar-agar plus the malt, dextrose, etc., ground to a fine powder, and all you do is add water.&amp;nbsp; I was trying to make the video as easy for new growers to follow as possible, without going into the detailed procedures to make your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy agar-agar from an oriental food store, you need to grind it to a powder, and then boil it first before adding the nutrients, and then sterilize it all together.&amp;nbsp; To this day, I have more pressing matters to spend my time on, so it's advantageous to use the pre-mixed stuff rather than going to that time and effort to make my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also get pre-mixed agar from shroomery sponsors such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://everythingmushrooms.com/search.php?search_query=agar&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Sporeworks&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly others.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15534335</next>\n<prev>15534313</prev>\n<first>15534173</first>\n<last>15538728</last>\n<when>1324230077</when>\n<utime>12/18/11 07:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
