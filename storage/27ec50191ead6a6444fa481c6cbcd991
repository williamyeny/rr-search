Don't use ANYTHING to reduce the area of the terrarium. The CO2 dissipates into the air within the terrarium, so the less air, the higher the concentration of CO2. It's not about air exchanges per hour, it's about maintaining a CO2 level less than 800 ppm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>13141013</prev>\n<first>13140583</first>\n<last>13142192</last>\n<when>1283528988</when>\n<utime>09/03/10 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
