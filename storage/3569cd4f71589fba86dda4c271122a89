I have dug a 3 foot hole and filled it with cow manure, horse manure, straw, soil, verm everything in the book plus spawned it with an un flushed 100 pound bulk tub. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got like an eighth out of it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work better to keep it above ground.&amp;nbsp; I know in my cold climate, it's hard to get any gourmet mushrooms to fruit if below soil level.&amp;nbsp; But, by making above ground beds where they have a chance to warm up, performance is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, the prevailing wisdom is a casing layer is more forgiving, but if you screw up maintaining the casing layer, you're right back in the same boat.&amp;nbsp; If you're only around once or twice a day to mist, a casing layer might be called for, since it can serve as a reservoir for moisture.&amp;nbsp; If you're around all day to perform multiple mistings, that's probably the better choice, in which scenario I'd fruit uncased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, if your substrate is just a layer of grains, you'll need a casing.&amp;nbsp; It's only optional on bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15971514</next>\n<prev>15971336</prev>\n<first>15968507</first>\n<last>15972724</last>\n<when>1332265676</when>\n<utime>03/20/12 08:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
