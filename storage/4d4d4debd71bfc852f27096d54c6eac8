It can also waterlog down there.  The casing layer goes on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hippie chick sometimes sets UNcased substrates on a bed of vermiculite as a moisture reservoir, not bottom casing, but I wouldn't recommend that to new growers until you've done a few crops.  It takes time to learn to recognize optimum moisture content, and if you get it too wet, you're screwed.  A waterlogged substrate will fruit poorly if at all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6611343</next>\n<prev>6610755</prev>\n<first>6610317</first>\n<last>6611343</last>\n<when>1172468346</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 07:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
