I have a few 75X sterilizers and wouldn't trade for them.&amp;nbsp; The heating elements can easily be changed, and are available as spare parts. You can't beat the thermostat which relieves you of standing over the thing to keep the pressure steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can run the sterilizers without the inserts if you need to fit extra jars in.&amp;nbsp; I only use the insert when sterilizing filter patch bags.&amp;nbsp; Yes, you can lay three jars on their sides on top of the others.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11274842</next>\n<prev>11273959</prev>\n<first>11273442</first>\n<last>11277731</last>\n<when>1255928900</when>\n<utime>10/19/09 08:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
