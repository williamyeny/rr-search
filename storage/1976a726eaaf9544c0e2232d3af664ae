Most builders however, try to orient the blower output so it is at a 90 degree angle to the filter itself.  The idea is to pressurize the plenum, so that the same amount of pressure is exerted on all parts of the back side of the filter.  This ensures laminar flow out the front side.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6858982</prev>\n<first>6858982</first>\n<last>6859679</last>\n<when>1178068813</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
