I simply can't jump into every single thread and correct the mistakes.  There isn't that much time in a day that I have available.  Watch the posts where they're asking why they got such a lousy pinset, and they're messing with casing depth, air exchange, moisture content and everything else but lighting.  It's only later you find out they only have a small incandescent ceiling light that is only on when they're in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I speak from experience.  If you don't wish to follow that, read what Paul Stamets wrote in GGMC, which is that 12/12 of natural daylight fluorescent tubes with a light temperature of 6500K is best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6729211</next>\n<prev>6729178</prev>\n<first>6723152</first>\n<last>6792926</last>\n<when>1175300845</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
