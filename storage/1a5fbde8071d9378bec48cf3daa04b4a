Use at no more than 5%, which is one cup of chicken manure to each 20 cups of coir or horse manure.  Be sure to open the bag and lay what you're going to use out in the air for a couple of days to evaporate the ammonia out before pasteurizing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6703016</next>\n<prev>6702390</prev>\n<first>6701926</first>\n<last>6706684</last>\n<when>1174666259</when>\n<utime>03/23/07 07:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
