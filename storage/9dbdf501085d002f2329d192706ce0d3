This is contrary to my knowledge of that kingdom. A study showing what he is claiming would be a very big deal to the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, this is old news. Try reading the first chapter of the mushroom growers handbook.&amp;nbsp; I've posted the link many times.&amp;nbsp; In addition, I've observed hundreds of thousands of mushroom grows over the years, and I know for a fact that they grow up to three times the size by providing proper lighting.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully nobody thinks I like spending lots of money on electricity for my commercial mushroom farm for nothing.&amp;nbsp; I do it for massively increased yields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about that.&amp;nbsp; Three times the size and weight, which means three times the calories when we eat them.&amp;nbsp; Calories are a unit of energy.&amp;nbsp; Provide light to the mushrooms, and the mushrooms produce energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nalim said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mycelium derives no energy from light. All energy production comes from breakdown of organic compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nalim said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a masters degree in biology with a&amp;nbsp; large chunk of that aimed at microbiology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you should have learned as a freshman is to avoid making blanket negative statements such as 'Mycelium derives no energy from light', which can not be proved.&amp;nbsp; It is as wrong as saying 'gravity has no bearing on mushroom growth'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know some mushrooms are phototropic and will orient towards light.&amp;nbsp; This is a reaction to light.&amp;nbsp; Growing twice as large and producing twice or more the weight is not a reaction.&amp;nbsp; The mushroom has derived energy by or from the light in some way.&amp;nbsp; I have observed this countless times over the years, and duplicate the 'experiment' daily.&amp;nbsp; It's how I make my living.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16092870</next>\n<prev>16092454</prev>\n<first>16051935</first>\n<last>16108992</last>\n<when>1334497886</when>\n<utime>04/15/12 04:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
