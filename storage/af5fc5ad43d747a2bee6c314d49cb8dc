Soil test kits at a garden center are designed for testing soil.  If you're testing soil, compost or casing material, the latter is what you want.  If you're testing a pasteurization bath, you want the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you can squeeze out some moisture from your compost and test that with the pool test kit, but I'd suggest the other if it's available.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5958647</prev>\n<first>5958635</first>\n<last>5958769</last>\n<when>1155487349</when>\n<utime>08/13/06 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
