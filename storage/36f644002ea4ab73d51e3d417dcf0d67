This has been tried many times before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the endospores won't be bothered if they haven't been hydrated yet.  If you search the posts, you'll see folks have been trying to find a way around the PC for years, doing the exact thing over and over again, with each grower believing he's the first to think of the procedure.  Those of us who have been growing for many years recommend a PC.  It's not because we're stuck in our ways, it's because we've learned what works.

Good luck whatever path you choose to follow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6676422</next>\n<prev>6676343</prev>\n<first>4702138</first>\n<last>14571205</last>\n<when>1174065603</when>\n<utime>03/16/07 08:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
