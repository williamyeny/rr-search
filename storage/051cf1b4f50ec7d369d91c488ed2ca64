Mushrooms are 90% water and benefit greatly from misting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other benefit to misting is to replenish moisture in the casing layer or on the surface of the cake.  You can't do that with humidity, even at 100%.  It must be done by misting.  Opening the lid of a fruiting chamber a few times per day is a great idea.  A total influx of fresh air is always good for the pinning/fruiting mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7836630</prev>\n<first>7718837</first>\n<last>7836978</last>\n<when>1199586187</when>\n<utime>01/06/08 04:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
