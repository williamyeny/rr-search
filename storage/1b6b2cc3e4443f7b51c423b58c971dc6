While the light you use to look at it every day might help trigger a pin or two, if you want a real pinset like you see in the pictures here, expose your mycelia to light.  I expose to light from the day the spores are germinated on agar.  As for the casing, it depends on the strain, and if you have a good fruiting substrain or not.  Give it a week or two anyway.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2339010</next>\n<prev>2338464</prev>\n<first>2338464</first>\n<last>2340561</last>\n<when>1076899655</when>\n<utime>02/16/04 04:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
