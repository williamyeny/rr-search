It's to prevent the forum from being cluttered with non-relevant stuff that confuses the new people.&amp;nbsp; The so-called name somebody gave your print is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11647925</prev>\n<first>10610321</first>\n<last>11647971</last>\n<when>1260812800</when>\n<utime>12/14/09 07:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
