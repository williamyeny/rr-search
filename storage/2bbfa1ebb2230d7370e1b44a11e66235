I know there are WBS, Cow Poo, And a few other substrates.... i want to know which is thee most nutritive. (in otherwords which one produces more/more potent shrooms)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn't appear as though you thoroughly understand it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye grain, WBS, wheat berries, millet, sorghum, etc., are not bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; They're grains for spawn creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poo is what mommy changed out of your diapers and we don't grow mushrooms on it.&amp;nbsp; We use &lt;b&gt;manure&lt;/b&gt;, straw, coir, cotton waste, hay, chopped weeds, etc., as bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; However, none will provide increased potency over any other, since the choice of bulk substrate doesn't change the genetics.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15841928</next>\n<prev>15841693</prev>\n<first>15841096</first>\n<last>24736099</last>\n<when>1329840395</when>\n<utime>02/21/12 06:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
