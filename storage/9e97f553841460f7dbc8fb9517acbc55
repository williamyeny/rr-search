It's a mistake to skip buffering it with lime.  1.2 cups of hydrated lime is a bit too much for the tek you posted above.  Cut that amount in half, and use gypsum at a rate of ten percent the amount of peat.  In that recipe it would be 1.5 cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, coir is a poor choice for a casing since it has as much fungi food as horse manure.  Use coir for a substrate instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straw can be found at any feed store, and horse manure is free from any house with a horse out back.  Just knock on the door with a bag and shovel in your hand.  Only collect the field dried and aged nuggets from the pasture, not the fresh stuff they clean out of the barn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382806</next>\n<prev>6382377</prev>\n<first>6378964</first>\n<last>6383862</last>\n<when>1166456803</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 05:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
