Remember, a wet filter will allow contaminants to colonize right through it.  If your metal lid has the recommended three to four 1/16&quot; holes, with tyvek over that, the jar won't dry out in the next two to three weeks.  I'd remove the foil and just set them on a shelf.  Next time, remember to wait until your inoculant is ready.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6438303</next>\n<prev>6438267</prev>\n<first>6438220</first>\n<last>6438420</last>\n<when>1168288582</when>\n<utime>01/08/07 10:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
