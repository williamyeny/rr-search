At that point, add the flour.&nbsp; Remember, the 2,1,1 recipe is a guideline, but if your verm is course it won't hold as much water, so you may need to use more verm or less water.&nbsp; When you load the jars, the mix should look and feel dry, and absolutely NO WATER should drip out of a handful when you squeeze it as hard as you can.&nbsp; Cakes made on the dry side perform better, colonize faster, and contaminate less often.&nbsp; Remember, you're going to dunk and roll anyway before the flush, so that's when the water to support mushrooms gets added.<br />RR"}}
