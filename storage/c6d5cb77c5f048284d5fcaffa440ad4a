{"key":"post-4228674","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4228674</id>\n<content>A good rule of thumb for working with grains from wbs to rye to popcorn, wheat, etc., is to soak and/or boil the grains until they double their original size.  After that, get the outside of the grains as dry as you possibly can before loading the jars.  All the moisture you need is on the inside of the kernel. Any method you use to achieve this will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4229495</next>\n<prev>4228035</prev>\n<first>4209009</first>\n<last>4274779</last>\n<when>1117258088</when>\n<utime>05/28/05 08:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
