At 160F, it would take 12 hours or longer for the inside of a 5 pound substrate bag to reach 140F.  You're only supposed to pasterurize for an hour, to an hour and a half maximum, so by the time your substrate or casing material reached the right temp in the center, the outside is partially sterilized.  Use water to pasteurize.  Water is a much better heat conductor than air, which can only transfer the heat by convection.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7572734</next>\n<prev>7571817</prev>\n<first>7570044</first>\n<last>19903068</last>\n<when>1193667061</when>\n<utime>10/29/07 05:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
