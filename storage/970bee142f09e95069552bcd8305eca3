A smaller tote would want a bit less.  Also, remember a 1/2 hole is four times the area of a 1/4&quot; hole.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll always want to mist.  You want your substrates to be losing moisture, because that's a major pinning trigger.  You then replace the moisture that is evaporating by misting.  If you seal a terrarium up, you won't get nearly as good of a pinset, even if the humidity is 100%.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6967100</next>\n<prev>6963903</prev>\n<first>6963464</first>\n<last>6967603</last>\n<when>1180075716</when>\n<utime>05/25/07 09:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
