It would use up all your grain, and any mistakes you might make would wipe out the whole thing.  <br />I'd suggest using each of your six quarts in their own small trays.  Peat/verm makes a nice casing.  A perlite terrarium will be fine.  Just be sure to make a lot of holes in it or fan a few times per day.  Agreed, you don't need to heat.  70 is great for fruiting.<br />RR"}}
