I've noticed that if you don't, they won't fruit for that week anyway, but that extra week in the FC starts them drying out.  If you go a full week past full colonization and then do a dunk and roll, they start pinning almost right away.  I'd do them all at once.  Keep humidity at 99% and give as much fresh air as you can.  My terrariums look like I shot them with a shotgun.  They're drilled full of holes everywhere, sides, top and bottom.<br />RR"}}
