To speed things up, DON'T shake at inoculation.  Leave the spore solution in the spot you squirt it.  After a couple of days of good, visible growth, give the first and only shake to distribute the now colonized kernels around the jar.  It should finish within three to four days after the shake.<br />RR"}}
