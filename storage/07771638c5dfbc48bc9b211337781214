Cloning from the third would make it the fourth, and wouldn't help.  Go back to spores.  A given cell line can only divide so many times before loss of vigor sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some ten year old cultures, but they've been stored in the refrigerator and have no more than six weeks of growth on them, so they do fine.  However, if you're not making master slants, consider three g2g the limit if you want aggressive growth.  I've proved this on many occasions.  It's not just paul stamets who says it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6643876</next>\n<prev>6643359</prev>\n<first>6642761</first>\n<last>6647752</last>\n<when>1173252903</when>\n<utime>03/07/07 09:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
