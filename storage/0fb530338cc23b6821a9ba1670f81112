It matters what is INside the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were using a bag to colonize manure from fully colonized grains, peroxide might take care of cobweb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the bag is grains that are not fully colonized and you open it up, you will definitely contaminate it if it's not already.  If it is, toss it out.  There's no recovery from molds on uncolonized grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6164941</prev>\n<first>6164653</first>\n<last>6165066</last>\n<when>1160752399</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 06:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
