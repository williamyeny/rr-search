We started construction almost exactly this time last year, and stopped on Nov 4 when winter closed in hard.&amp;nbsp; We'll be doing the landscaping and finishing the retaining rock wall/entrance as soon as the snow melts in mid May. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've got nearly 3,000 shiitake blocks inside it right now.&amp;nbsp; First harvests came out about a month ago.&amp;nbsp; We expect to be at full speed by June or July, with 40 to 60 pounds per day coming out.&amp;nbsp; I sell to the local grocery stores for $5/pound, which is a steal for them, but because our costs are almost nil besides our own labor, it's making us a living and we get to stay home at our cabin in the mountains with plenty of time for hiking and fishing. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12345497</next>\n<prev>12345385</prev>\n<first>12345182</first>\n<last>12345576</last>\n<when>1270612014</when>\n<utime>04/07/10 06:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
