But do I just cut a small Peace of clean myc agar and all from the plate and transfer it to a unused plate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same as here, but it's almost 40 miles of old copper to the nearest switch, so dial-up won't even work.&amp;nbsp; I have to use satellite.&amp;nbsp; It's expensive and slow.&amp;nbsp; Only about five or so times dial up speed at best.&amp;nbsp; You might look into it as an option though.&amp;nbsp; You still have to start a video and click pause.&amp;nbsp; It's not even fast enough to watch youtube videos without constantly buffering.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15183860</next>\n<prev>15182944</prev>\n<first>15180312</first>\n<last>15183860</last>\n<when>1317867860</when>\n<utime>10/06/11 05:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
