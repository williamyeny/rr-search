It doesn't mean <i>whatever temperature your room is</i>. Normal room temperature is defined as 69F to 77F.&nbsp; If your grow area is outside those parameters, then you need supplemental heat.&nbsp; I'm 1,000 miles north of Colorado at elevation and it's already been below zero here.&nbsp; We have a foot of snow on the ground, and I don't use 'incubators' but rather find a warm place indoors for my colonizing substrates.&nbsp; I don't even have a thermostat to set.&nbsp; Our cabin is heated with a wood stove, and the temperature is far from stable.&nbsp; When we leave for a day, the fire goes out and the cabin is colder than shit when we get home.&nbsp; This has never had a negative effect that I can tell on colonization.&nbsp; Mushroom mycelium isn't as delicate as a newborn baby, which some people around here seem to think.<br />To the OP, don't wrap a light bulb with foil.&nbsp; Usually, a cupboard above the refrigerator or stove will get you the right temperature range.&nbsp; It's always warmer near the ceiling than near the floor.&nbsp; Put that to work for you.<br />RR"}}
