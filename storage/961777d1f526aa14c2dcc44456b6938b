That's why there's far more variation in trip quality and macroscopic appearance from each crop from even the same print than there is difference between siblings of the same human or animal family for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 'cube is a cube' means just that. They have the same growth and nutritional/environmental requirements.  Every trip will be different, so it matters little which named strain one chooses.  You won't have the same trip twice, even from the same strain.  In fact, you're very unlikely to have the same trip twice, even from fruits from the same substrate tray. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6651275</next>\n<prev>6651003</prev>\n<first>6649453</first>\n<last>6652581</last>\n<when>1173416981</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 07:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
