If you have too much flow, you can easily block off part of the intake to the fan.  This will also reduce current flow on the motor because less air is being moved.  Another, but more expensive way to reduce flow is to use a motor speed controller, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a lighting dimmer on the motor itself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5766538</prev>\n<first>5766538</first>\n<last>5766878</last>\n<when>1150715262</when>\n<utime>06/19/06 02:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
