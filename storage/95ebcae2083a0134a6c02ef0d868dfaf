You'll want to add 1/2 inch or so of casing material to the top of the grains when it reaches full colonization.  Read up on casing.  I recommend 50/50 peat-verm.  Cut the top half of the bag off just at the level of the top of your casing layer and place in a fruiting chamber.  If you don't have one, just cut a few slits in the top half of the bag for air exchange and use the bag for its own fruiting chamber.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5800856</next>\n<prev>5800788</prev>\n<first>5799730</first>\n<last>10221337</last>\n<when>1151550664</when>\n<utime>06/29/06 06:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
