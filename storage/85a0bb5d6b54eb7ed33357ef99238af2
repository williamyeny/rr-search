I'd suggest starting over and being more careful next time.  Also, at the top of the page is a 'search posts' feature that has all the information you need.  There is no easy way to grow mushrooms.  It's work, it's careful work, and often it's hard work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6850852</prev>\n<first>6850838</first>\n<last>6850857</last>\n<when>1177899348</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 05:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
