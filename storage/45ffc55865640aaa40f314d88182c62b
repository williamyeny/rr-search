It's almost always because of bacterial contamination in the jar.  The bacteria claims part of the rye, and the mushroom mycelium claims its share.  When the mushroom mycelium reaches the bacterial contaminated part of the substrate, it stops 'colonizing' because that area is already taken.  Fruiting is the natural response to organisms in danger.  They reproduce.<br />I wouldn't attempt to spawn it under these conditions.  Just let the fruits grow and harvest them when they quit growing.<br />RR"}}
