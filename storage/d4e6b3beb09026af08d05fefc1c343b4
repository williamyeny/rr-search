Try wadding up a few pieces of aluminum foil, and then wrapping them with another piece to elevate the jars off the bottom.  Another fix is to use the rings from jar lids.  Using a cloth can often tip the jars over because the cloth moves around so much when the water boils.  It will also sometimes scorch when between the jars and the heat of the burner below.<br />RR"}}
