Air exchange is the number one pinning trigger.  I've made clear from the start that when you drill a lot of holes in an FC, that you should use three to five inches of well drained perlite.  He had 1 1/2 to 2 inches, thus humidity was too low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, UVB is the wrong light source.  Mushrooms are not reptiles.  Room lighting is even worse if it's incandescent.  Incandescent light bulbs have a color temperature of 3,000 Kelvin, and mushrooms pin best with a higher color temperature in the 5,000 to 7,000 Kelvin range.  I suggest 'natural daylight fluorescent' with a color temperature of 6,500 Kelvin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major pinning triggers are, in order of importance: Full colonization, Fresh air with the corresponding decrease in CO2 levels, 98% to 100% humidity, evaporaton of moisture from the substrate, and last but not least, bright high frequency light. Put all of those factors together and watch them explode.   Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7090582</next>\n<prev>7089705</prev>\n<first>7088946</first>\n<last>7201280</last>\n<when>1182765185</when>\n<utime>06/25/07 12:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
