{"key":"post-5988630","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5988630</id>\n<content>To prevent spawn bags from exploding in the PC, you need to allow the pressure to return to zero very slowly after the cycle.  The bags are also at 15 psi at the end of the cycle, so if you just shut off the stove, the pressure leaves the PC quickly as it cools due to the large surface area exposed to your room air, but the bags within stay hot longer, thus they want to blow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the cycle, I turn the stove to its lowest setting rather than to off.  This allows the PC to cool much slower, preventing blowout in the bags.  The other thing that helps is not to allow the weight to rattle during the cooking cycle.  As soon as pressure is reached, adjust your stove to the minimum setting that will maintain 15psi without producing excess steam that needs to escape.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>26283407</next>\n<prev>5988359</prev>\n<first>5985147</first>\n<last>26283407</last>\n<when>1156323275</when>\n<utime>08/23/06 11:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
