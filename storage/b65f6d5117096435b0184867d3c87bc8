{"key":"post-8419461","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8419461</id>\n<content>Uncased rye performes poorly, when it fruits at all.  It needs a casing layer, or to be mixed with verm or coir(coir or manure is preferred).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye should be prepared in quart jars for best results, and you only shake ONCE during colonization.  It's easy to break up the grains by banging them against a fully inflated tire.  Shake once at about 30% colonization, and then shake again to break up the grains at spawning time so you can pour them out of the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8419650</next>\n<prev>8419445</prev>\n<first>8408771</first>\n<last>8567830</last>\n<when>1211209887</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 06:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
