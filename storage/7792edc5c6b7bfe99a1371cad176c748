{"key":"post-7611005","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7611005</id>\n<content>The graph in TMC showing maximum mycelium growth at 86F is just flat out wrong.  Growth slows down dramatically at 83F and above.  Growth is flat between 75F and 82F, and then slows down above that.  I recommend 75F because bacteria and thermophilic molds are slightly suppressed at that temperature, but the cubensis mycelium is in its maximum rate-of-growth temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7611008</next>\n<prev>7610991</prev>\n<first>7610685</first>\n<last>7611064</last>\n<when>1194550391</when>\n<utime>11/08/07 09:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
