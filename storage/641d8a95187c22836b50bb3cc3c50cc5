Very few molds are toxic if eaten, and none of the common contaminant molds to mushrooms will cause the fruits to become toxic, but bacteria causes food poisoning and should be avoided at all costs.  Never eat a rotten mushroom, or any other rotten food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7474544</prev>\n<first>7471336</first>\n<last>7474668</last>\n<when>1191278825</when>\n<utime>10/02/07 01:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
