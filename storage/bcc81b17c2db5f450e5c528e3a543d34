{"key":"post-6562654","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6562654</id>\n<content>The key to remember is jars colonize fine at 'normal room temperature' which 66F is not.  I have some fully colonized pf jars that were inoculated 8 days ago and kept at 75F on an open shelf.  I'd suggest a heater for your room over an incubator, so they don't sit in stale air.  As Roadkill said, 66F is too low and will take longer to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6562781</next>\n<prev>6562633</prev>\n<first>6562359</first>\n<last>15694664</last>\n<when>1171393315</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 09:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
