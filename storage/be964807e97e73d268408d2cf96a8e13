{"key":"post-6319149","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6319149</id>\n<content>On my monitor, I see pink in the two pint jars.  It's really clear in the bottom picture, left hand side of the jar.  I see a distinct line of separation between the mushroom mycelium and the pink mold, probably lipstic mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half pint in the first two pictures has a small blotch of bacteria near the center of the picture.  That may or may not be a problem.  Sometimes the mycelium runs right over bacteria.  Just keep an eye on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6319151</next>\n<prev>6319129</prev>\n<first>6317917</first>\n<last>6320530</last>\n<when>1164849945</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 03:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
