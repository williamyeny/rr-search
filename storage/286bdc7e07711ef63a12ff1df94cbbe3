If you keep your house at normal room temperature, there is absolutely no reason to build an incubator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, your jars may colonize three or four days faster at 80F than they will at 70F, but at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, if you're living in an unheated house during the winter and &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; use an incubator, fan it out several times daily.&amp;nbsp; Also, you can skip the box and just run a small space heater near the shelf you let jars colonize on, thus negating the effects of CO2 and stale air in a tub.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9011392</next>\n<prev>9007083</prev>\n<first>9006681</first>\n<last>9050727</last>\n<when>1222786439</when>\n<utime>09/30/08 05:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
