They fruited 'ok' but not as well as brf cakes in my opinion.  You can use liquid coffee to hydrate the wbs, and you can include your spent coffee grinds as an additive in your compost/manure substrates. Coffee won't make your mushrooms more potent.  I don't believe potency and substrate composition are necessarily connected.  People have grown killer shrooms and bunk shrooms on just about every substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that adding coffee to the mix seems to speed up the process of getting to the pinning stage, but not dramatically.  Coffee shines best in my experience with the sclerotia producing species.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5890379</next>\n<prev>5746950</prev>\n<first>5746903</first>\n<last>5890565</last>\n<when>1150251785</when>\n<utime>06/14/06 05:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
