Whether it comes from a lamp or the sun makes little difference indoors. Most mushrooms in nature fruit in areas where they get at least some direct sun each day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you using artificial lighting, look for 6500 kelvin color temperature.&amp;nbsp; It's proved best for mushroom growing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14455907</next>\n<prev>14454773</prev>\n<first>14453069</first>\n<last>14492260</last>\n<when>1305467960</when>\n<utime>05/15/11 04:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
