In fact, the manure from just about any grass or grain eating animal works.  I've seen deer, elk, moose, buffalo, donkey and rabbit manure used with success. The species likely evolved on cow or buffalo manure, and if prepared properly, it works wonderful, even the bagged up cow manure from the nursery.<br />The suitability of any manure is not related to how many compartments in the stomach, but what the diet is.  Horse manure is great for the lazy because it's so easy to prepare.  Cow and buffalo manure takes a bit more work to get right, but performance is excellent.<br />RR"}}
