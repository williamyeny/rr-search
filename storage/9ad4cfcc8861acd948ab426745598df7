It will take a long time for the second substrate to get colonized with the weakened mycelium, then the fruiting procedure has to be initiated all over again.  Meanwhile, some of that old substrate is sitting there waiting to contaminate the new batch.<br />A more effecient use of your fruiting space is to rapid cycle your trays.  Once you finish the second flush with a tray, have another fresh one waiting to replace it.  This way, you always have rapidly expanding mycelium making up your projects.<br />RR"}}
