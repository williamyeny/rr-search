Does letting the mushroom continue to grow to its full size increase the overall psilocybin content at all? (Not potency actual net amount of psilocybin) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only keep a patch going by adding substrate if you also let the mushrooms mature and drop spores.&amp;nbsp; It also only works if you're in a habitat where they'll actually survive the weather extremes.&amp;nbsp; About the only way to trigger fruiting without rain is to water daily and put a big sheet of cardboard over the patch to hold super high humidity at the surface where primordia form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the veil tears and spores drop, mushrooms begin to die and rot.&amp;nbsp; Pick just before veil tear for best quality.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15053230</prev>\n<first>15051000</first>\n<last>15054380</last>\n<when>1315610521</when>\n<utime>09/10/11 02:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
