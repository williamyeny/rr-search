Does anyone have any experience with this method?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not a method of pasteurization.&amp;nbsp; It's semi-sterilization and the only reason people get away with that lazy procedure is because mold spores rarely are able to germinate on coir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straw needs to be soaked in hot soapy water for two hours, or cold non-soapy water for 24 hours before being heated to 140F to 160F (60C to 70C) for one hour.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12250598</next>\n<prev>12250499</prev>\n<first>12250399</first>\n<last>12250942</last>\n<when>1269304033</when>\n<utime>03/23/10 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
