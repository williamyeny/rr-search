{"key":"post-6288201","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6288201</id>\n<content>Polyfill, tyvek, or my favorite, synthetic filter disks all work.  The filter disks can be used and re-used thousands of times, so they're the best in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing wrong with polyfill.  Just don't stuff it too tight into the hole or the gasses can't escape.  If you use 1/4&quot; holes with polyfill, drill two or three of them because one isn't enough.  Trim the excess with scissors so you don't have polyfill hanging into your grain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6288397</next>\n<prev>6288183</prev>\n<first>6287571</first>\n<last>6304509</last>\n<when>1163661215</when>\n<utime>11/16/06 09:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
