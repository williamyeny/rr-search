If you fail to replace the water that is evaporating, performance will be poor.&amp;nbsp; It shouldn't be hard to pick up your cake and judge moisture content by weight.&amp;nbsp; If you haven't been misting well, pile up a tablespoon or two of vermiculite on top of the cake and soak it well.&amp;nbsp; Another option is to put the cake in a saucer of water overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't worry about picking up your cakes.&amp;nbsp; Just wash your hands well with soap and water first.&amp;nbsp; You can also rinse the cake under the faucet again if you're worried.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16395804</next>\n<prev>16395739</prev>\n<first>16395707</first>\n<last>16396189</last>\n<when>1339970391</when>\n<utime>06/18/12 12:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
