I'd suggest dumping the aquarium pump and just drilling holes and/or leaving the lid crooked.  CO2 is only slightly heavier than normal air, and won't drain like water, even with holes at the bottom, which you should also have.  I have LOTS of holes in my terrariums, including on the floor.  I drill at least a dozen or more on all six sides.  My larger terrariums have several hundred holes drilled into them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6750010</next>\n<prev>6749178</prev>\n<first>6749152</first>\n<last>6751893</last>\n<when>1175760658</when>\n<utime>04/05/07 11:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
