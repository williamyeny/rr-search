I dont trust this method at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temp at the center of the substrate is the most important factor.  If you don't reach 140F for an hour, pasteurization is not complete, and if you get it too hot, partial sterilization occurs, rendering the substrate susceptible to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you need to keep the manure sealed from the water or you end up with manure soup.  Search my name and pasteurization tek for the way I suggest.  There is ZERO smell if you're using field aged manure.  I do it in the kitchen and mrs rabbit isn't prone to telling me what I can and can't do in our house.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8306586</next>\n<prev>8306190</prev>\n<first>8304102</first>\n<last>8373470</last>\n<when>1208664900</when>\n<utime>04/20/08 07:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
