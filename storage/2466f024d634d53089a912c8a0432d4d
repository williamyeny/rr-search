Dry perlite doesn't do squat, except to shield the damp perlite below from your fruiting chamber.  You want three to five inches of rinsed, and then well drained perlite.  No dry perlite.<br />You also want plenty of fresh air in the area of the fruiting chamber.  It needs to be somewhere besides a bathtub.  Bathrooms are breeding grounds for molds and bacteria, so I'd look for a well ventilated room with a window for natural light.<br />RR"}}
