The reason being, coffee isn't as nutritious for fungi as the brown rice flour.  I've made 1/2 pint cakes of coffee grinds/verm, and they fruited 'ok' but not as well as the control brf cakes fruited alongside with the same isolate.  In other words, the coffee grinds will dilute the brf.  Coffee grinds are a great additive in bulk substrates however.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5385400</next>\n<prev>5384812</prev>\n<first>5382998</first>\n<last>5385882</last>\n<when>1142009191</when>\n<utime>03/10/06 06:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
