Cow manure can perform nearly as well too, but will benefit from a bit of coffee grinds and some loosening up with vermiculite.  As I've said hundreds of times, a combination of substrate ingredients will give better performance than any one by itself.  That means, you'll get more bang by mixing cow, horse, and a bit of chicken manure with coir, coffee grinds, compost and straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horse manure is a preferred substrate because its texture is easy for the mycelium to penetrate, and works fine by itself, as do any of the bulk substrate ingredients listed above.  Horse manure edges them out a bit in my opinion, but coir runs a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer the original question, my preferred spawn material hands down over all the others is organic rye berries.  Rye grass seed would be second, with wbs coming in third.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6931062</next>\n<prev>6931026</prev>\n<first>6930498</first>\n<last>8622320</last>\n<when>1179443704</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 02:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
