It's going to be hit or miss.  Test tube slants with a piece of wood in them and kept at 35F will store for five years without losing vigor.  They will need a week or so to rejuvinate, but then seem to grow normally.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5959301</prev>\n<first>5958878</first>\n<last>5959454</last>\n<when>1155501928</when>\n<utime>08/13/06 11:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
