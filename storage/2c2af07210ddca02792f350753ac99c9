If you have fully colonized grains, there's nothing wrong with inoculating pasteurized straw outside.  It needs to be a clean operation, but doesn't in any way require sterility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are generally more contaminants outside than inside.  For sterile work, use a glovebox in a small, closed room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6103059</next>\n<prev>6054918</prev>\n<first>6054918</first>\n<last>6103059</last>\n<when>1158113734</when>\n<utime>09/13/06 05:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
