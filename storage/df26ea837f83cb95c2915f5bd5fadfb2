Ditto for mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; When we read that mycelium uses nitrogen in its metabolism just as nearly all life forms, it means that it needs to be digested from solid food.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms don't absorb usable nutrients from non-organic sources.&amp;nbsp; They're just not wired that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This silly argument has been going on for years with noobs.&amp;nbsp; Ten or so years ago I offered a free microscope to the first person who could grow a real hydroponic mushroom on inert materials fed with chemical 'ferts' only.&amp;nbsp; A quick search will reveal all the threads that started with everyone going to prove me wrong and do it.&amp;nbsp; Not a single person ever pulled it off, so this talk about 'ferts' is bunk not supported by science or experience.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18980636</next>\n<prev>18980544</prev>\n<first>18645452</first>\n<last>18982463</last>\n<when>1381851182</when>\n<utime>10/15/13 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
