{"key":"post-7593759","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7593759</id>\n<content>A 60 watt light bulb is probably the worst possible choice.  Incandescent bulbs burn with a red color at about 3,000K.  You want at a minimum to use cool white fluorescent with a color temp of 5,000 Kelvin, but a daylight fluorescent lamp at 6,500 Kelvin is better yet.  Get a 15 watt, 6,500K compact fluorescent, and you'll be miles ahead and only use 1/4 as much electricity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7593772</next>\n<prev>7593743</prev>\n<first>7593743</first>\n<last>7594081</last>\n<when>1194190518</when>\n<utime>11/04/07 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
