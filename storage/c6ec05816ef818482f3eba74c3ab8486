This would need to be at least on a 15 amp circuit.<br />Do you have an electric stove or water heater?&nbsp; If so, you could use that circuit for your pasteurizer, after shutting off or unplugging the original device while you're using it.<br />To calculate amps on a single phase circuit such as you'll find in homes, simply divide the watts by volts.&nbsp; Always derate 20% or so, meaning for example if your circuit draws 19 amps, don't try to use it on&nbsp; 20 amp breaker or fuse.&nbsp; Go to the next larger circuit breaker and appropriate wire size.<br />RR"}}
