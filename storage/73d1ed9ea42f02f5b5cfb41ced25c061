I like that it has a magnehelic to read static pressure.  It's 14 years old.  You won't know how clogged up the filter is until you buy it.  However, with the magnehelic only reading .65 inches of static pressure, it doesn't seem like it should be too clogged up though, provided the gauge is accurate.  Of course that also assumes they took the picture with the unit powered up, and it's not just stuck on that figure.<br />RR"}}
