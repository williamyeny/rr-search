If you squeeze it a bit harder, a small 'rivulet' will drop down and then stop after a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Field capacity is a measurement of bulk substrates such as manure or coir, and doesn't apply to BRF because it would make it too wet.&amp;nbsp; A properly made batch of brf that is ready to be loaded into jars will have no water at all squeeze out if you pick up a handful and squeeze hard.&amp;nbsp; It will however, be damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;BRF tek&lt;/a&gt;, you're supposed to use fine or medium grade verm because it holds more water, thus your cakes aren't as 'wet' with a given amount.&amp;nbsp; The recipe when using fine or medium verm is 2,1,1 and since you used less water than that, you 'may' be OK, but it's all a wild guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mixing the water and verm, there should be no standing water in the bottom of the bowl.&amp;nbsp; If there is, pour it out, and then mix in the brown rice flour.&amp;nbsp; A cake made slightly dry will colonize FAR faster, thus less contamination prone.&amp;nbsp; After full colonization plus one week, you dunk and roll to insert the moisture required for the flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10002168</next>\n<prev>10002039</prev>\n<first>10001219</first>\n<last>10002168</last>\n<when>1237498557</when>\n<utime>03/20/09 12:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
