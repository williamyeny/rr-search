That still doesn't answer the original post though. How many cakes per case 9x11? and how thick should my casing layer be? (bottom and top?) I read somewhere that the bottom should be 1/2&quot; and the top layer should be upwards of 1&quot;. Is that correct?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows what you're asking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to read up on terminology.&amp;nbsp; The word 'case' is a verb which means &quot;to apply a casing layer' over a bulk substrate.&amp;nbsp; It isn't a word for the container you place your bulk substrate and spawn into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, cubensis benefits little from a casing layer, and brf cakes are already 2/3 vermiculite as it is.&amp;nbsp; Fruit cakes as cakes, or if you want to grow bulk, break them up and mix with pasteurized horse manure at a rate of 1 part cake to 3 parts manure.&amp;nbsp; Fruit it uncased.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13746281</next>\n<prev>13745529</prev>\n<first>13742229</first>\n<last>13746281</last>\n<when>1294412299</when>\n<utime>01/07/11 04:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
