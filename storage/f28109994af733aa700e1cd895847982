{"key":"post-6577570","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6577570</id>\n<content>Plastic has no nutrients for mushroom growing, and straw is a substrate material, not a casing material.  You could use the plastic as a CONTAINER, but you wouldn't case it.  You would colonize a substrate, then case the substrate.  Remember, 'casing' is the top layer.  It doesn't refer to the tray as if it were a suit&lt;b&gt;case&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I feel compelled to correct the improper use of nomenclature is because new growers read the posts to learn, but get horribly confused on what is what when the terms are used incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seedling starting trays you pictured above have been used by growers for years to grow mushrooms.  They work fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6577606</next>\n<prev>6577564</prev>\n<first>6577527</first>\n<last>6578066</last>\n<when>1171730448</when>\n<utime>02/17/07 06:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
