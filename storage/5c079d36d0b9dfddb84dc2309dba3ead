{"key":"post-1472635","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>1472635</id>\n<content>Well, I built 4 laundry baskets and thought they did pretty well.  Then I started these logs, and the first log delivered more than all four baskets combined.  If you scroll up and look at the pic of the log in this thread, I doubt you will see a flush that thick on the top of a casing.  I know I haven't.   That is a 48&quot; log, 8&quot; diameter, that produced 17 LBS wet, and the whole thing was finished and out of the grow room in 3 weeks from date of spawning.  That size log uses roughly the same amount of straw used in a laundry basket, but at least 3 times the yeild, and in half the time. Didn't mist once from start to finish.  I'm not trying to convince anyone....I just happened to see the thread and put my 2 cents worth in.  Happy shrooming all. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1472810</next>\n<prev>1472596</prev>\n<first>1471309</first>\n<last>1473070</last>\n<when>1050750275</when>\n<utime>04/19/03 02:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
