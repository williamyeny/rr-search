Post office tyvek is not only illegal to use but subpar as far as performance goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal room temperature is the way to colonize jars.  People who build incubators have a higher rate of contamination and other problems and those who succeed only have a minor decrease in colonization times.  75F to 80F is perfect for colonizing, and you should be able to find a nice place in your house that has that temperature, such as a top cupboard shelf in your kitchen or an upper bookshelf in the den.  Colonizing jars need gas exchange which they don't get in a sealed tub.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6849037</next>\n<prev>6848546</prev>\n<first>6848195</first>\n<last>6851598</last>\n<when>1177863587</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
