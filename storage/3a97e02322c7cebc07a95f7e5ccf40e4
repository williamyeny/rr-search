Check and see if it's still there.  If it was between the cake and the 'casing' soil, it was most likely mold.  Go look again and get a good description.  If it's bruising, it will be mycelium that is green or blue.  If it's trichoderma, the green will be a layer <i><u>above</u></i> the mycelium.<br />RR"}}
