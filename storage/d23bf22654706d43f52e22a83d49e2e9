{"key":"post-11700280","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>11700280</id>\n<content>The problem with pesticides, and especially herbicides, is that the bees continue to forage the treated flowers, and then bring the chemical-laced nectar and pollen back to the hive.&amp;nbsp; It's then used to make and fill the comb that the bees use for a decade or longer.&amp;nbsp; Over time these pesticides build up to toxic levels in the comb, making the larvae weak, which in turn makes them unable to fight off mites, robber bees, yellow jackets, and other parasites.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, the entire colony of adult bees says 'fuck it' and flies away, leaving the emerging brood behind to fend for itself, which it can't do without workers, thus the whole hive dies out.&amp;nbsp; This, so the theory goes, is the leading cause of CCD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for the rest of us, honey is only a byproduct to most commercial beekeepers.&amp;nbsp; They get paid thousands of dollars by farmers to bring the hives during pollination season to pollinate the crops, since through irresponsible use of chemicals, the farmers have long since killed off the ferrel bees and other pollinators, thus they need beekeepers to carry their bees around the country on trucks.&amp;nbsp; This further adds to the stress, and exposes the bees to parasites from other hives they interact with in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't jerk with my hives.&amp;nbsp; They're here for mine and my neighbors orchards, and I don't take them elsewhere. All of my neighbors up here are organic gardeners. That's why our honey is the best of the best.&amp;nbsp; The bees are healthy and everything they feed on is deep in the forest away from chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11700331</next>\n<prev>11700181</prev>\n<first>11681761</first>\n<last>13673392</last>\n<when>1261524099</when>\n<utime>12/23/09 01:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
