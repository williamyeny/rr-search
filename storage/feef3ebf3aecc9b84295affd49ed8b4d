My house stays at about 65-68 and drops to 62 at night. The recommended fruiting temp is 80 degrees so i gues my question is what is the best way to keep a steady temp &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80F is not recommended, nor is steady temperature.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a day/night temperature differential to correspond with the light cycle.&amp;nbsp; Since your 6500K CFL a few inches away from the terrarium will provide daylight-hours heating, you're fine.&amp;nbsp; Run a space heater in the room or turn up the heat in the house so it doesn't drop much below 70F at night.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17641859</prev>\n<first>17641701</first>\n<last>17641972</last>\n<when>1359637245</when>\n<utime>01/31/13 03:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
