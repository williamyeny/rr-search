A bit of bacteria isn't a problem with bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; If you can get it dried out a little, the mycelium will eat it for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8909327</next>\n<prev>8908780</prev>\n<first>8908247</first>\n<last>8913278</last>\n<when>1221102734</when>\n<utime>09/11/08 06:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
