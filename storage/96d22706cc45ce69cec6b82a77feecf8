You need to look at pinning triggers like the instruments in a band. One instrument can be slightly off, and the band still plays the song.  Often one instrument can be taken away and the music still sounds ok.  However, if all are working together, it's awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the projects you remove from light after exposure are mainaining a higher humidity due to no heat from the lights. Humidity is a pinning trigger just like light.  Maybe the ones you remove from the lights get better air circulation.  Fresh air is a pinning trigger just like light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, light has no effect on colonizing mycelium, good or bad.  The old advice of &quot;incubate in total darkness&quot; is bunk. Those words were written by Stamets in TMC 20 years ago, and he disavows that advice today. I concur. The only real time that keeping in the dark has an advantage in my experience is during casing run, when the introduction of light after casing colonization can serve as one of the pinning triggers along with air exchange and proper humidity.  Bear in mind, you want a constant rate of evaporation from your substrate to acheive the best pinset.  If you're at 100% humidity, there will be little to no moisture evaporating from your casing layer, and pinsets will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To repeat, light is a pinning trigger, but it isn't the only one, and it's greatly overrated.  For the best pinsets, you have to balance several triggers at once.  Screw up on any of them, and pinsets suffer, regardless of what you do with light.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5593326</next>\n<prev>5593310</prev>\n<first>5593195</first>\n<last>5593742</last>\n<when>1146842345</when>\n<utime>05/05/06 06:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
