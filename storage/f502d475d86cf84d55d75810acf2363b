Exactly how many holes you can have before too much moisture is being leaked for the perlite to compensate for depends on the size of the FC and the surface area of the perlite so trial and error 'til you get the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely bad advice, which has ruined many growers efforts over the years as the search engine here clearly shows.&amp;nbsp; As fresh air is entering and leaving the shotgun terrarium, it's absorbing moisture from the perlite, which is re-moistened each time you mist.&amp;nbsp; Taping holes LOWERS humidity as thousands of noobs have already found out.&amp;nbsp; Humidity NEVER 'leaks' out of a shotgun terrarium.&amp;nbsp; Nature abhors a vacuum, thus as air exits a shotgun terrarium, fresh air is being drawn up through the perlite, creating more humidity.&amp;nbsp; I fail to understand how this basic engineering concept is so difficult to grasp. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, new growers often incorrectly think that humidity is the most important factor, thus they screw up their terrariums trying to make the walls covered with condensation in order to satisfy their piece of shit walmart chinese hygrometer which doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; In addition fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger, so build the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;terrarium per the tek&lt;/a&gt; and don't tape the darned holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chamber is SGFC. just modified for my conditions. Also i had strong side winds that affect humidity greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should never be side winds against a terrarium.&amp;nbsp; This is not an outdoor tek, but an indoor one.&amp;nbsp; I've always recommended against running a fan in the room with a terrarium.&amp;nbsp; The shotgun terrarium is engineered to work with the &lt;i&gt;natural air currents&lt;/i&gt; in a room, not artificial fan-induced wind.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15326616</next>\n<prev>15325068</prev>\n<first>15324140</first>\n<last>15328364</last>\n<when>1320503890</when>\n<utime>11/05/11 05:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
