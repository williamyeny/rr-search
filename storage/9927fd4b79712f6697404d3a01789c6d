Mycelium uses air and produces CO2 as a byproduct just as we humans do.&amp;nbsp; In fact, fungi are more closely related to us than to plants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18902684</next>\n<prev>18902647</prev>\n<first>18902304</first>\n<last>18902872</last>\n<when>1380393278</when>\n<utime>09/28/13 09:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
