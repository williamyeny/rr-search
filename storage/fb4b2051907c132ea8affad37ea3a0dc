Maybe I read some conflicting information. Ill raise them up keeping them completely out, micropore and rubberband the tinfoil, if they're wet I won't knock em up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video says to keep the jars totally out of the water.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the water boils in the PC or cooking pot, it will violently splash over the tops of the jars, getting under the foil if they're sitting in the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13305171</next>\n<prev>13304975</prev>\n<first>13304472</first>\n<last>13307867</last>\n<when>1286494128</when>\n<utime>10/08/10 02:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
