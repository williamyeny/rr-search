Use the syringe while the needle is still red hot.  The first few drops of solution will sizzle and cool down the needle, allowing the rest of the solution to flow uncontaminated.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, an alcohol swab only wipes down the outside of the needle.  Your solution travels through the inside where the alcohol hasn't reached. Even if you dip the needle in a shotglass of alcohol, it won't penetrate to the inside.  It's like putting your thumb over a drinking straw and sticking it in a glass of water.  No water enters the straw unless you release your thumb. Use a flame.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5757711</next>\n<prev>5756671</prev>\n<first>5756599</first>\n<last>5757711</last>\n<when>1150472835</when>\n<utime>06/16/06 06:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
