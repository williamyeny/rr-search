It's for cleaning up airborne contaminants in your sterile lab before inoculations.  No chemical should be used around fruiting mushrooms of any kind.   Ten percent bleach is also a great air sanitizer.  Just put it in a mister that develops a very fine mist and spray it up into the room so it fills the room with a very fine fog.  As the fog settles, it will capture mold spores and bacteria, killing the bacteria and taking the mold spores to the floor.  It will ruin colored carpet and drapes though, so don't use it unless you're ok with that or unless everything is already white.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6855220</next>\n<prev>6854620</prev>\n<first>6854454</first>\n<last>6855293</last>\n<when>1177983813</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 04:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
