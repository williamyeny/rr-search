{"key":"post-7621189","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7621189</id>\n<content>I strongly recommend against leaving any grains on top of a substrate, exposed to air.  If the grains dry out and the mushroom mycelium weakens, they become the perfect place for molds to start.  Many growers get away with it, but the contamination rate will be higher over time.  Grains should be covered with at least a very light layer of substrate, imo.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7620695</prev>\n<first>7620611</first>\n<last>7621189</last>\n<when>1194791543</when>\n<utime>11/11/07 04:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
