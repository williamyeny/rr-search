Shoot the spore solution down the edge of the glass so it runs as far down the jar as possible, not into the middle of the rye.  Don't shake right away.  Wait for germination and partial colonization for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jars should be used as soon as they are sterilized.  Some people have waited longer and still succeeded, but it's rare.  Use them right away, or re-sterilize.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3035945</next>\n<prev>3035813</prev>\n<first>3035731</first>\n<last>3037482</last>\n<when>1093189755</when>\n<utime>08/22/04 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
