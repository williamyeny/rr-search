Try it with tissue a year or more old. Normally, it will take two to three weeks or more for mushroom mycelium to begin to grow from totally dry tissue.  Often, growth starts sooner than that, but is almost always mold.  If you have growth from completely dry tissue within a day and a half, it's almost a guarantee of mold.  You can quickly determine that under a small microscope.  Mushroom mycelium will be straight, while most molds will have an appearance of a steel wool pad with kinky, twisted mycelial strands with lots of side branching.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iodine is a great bactericide.  I dip dry tissue first in iodine for a minute or two, then wash it off with a peroxide dip for five full minutes, then take the tissue through two distilled water washes before placing on the antibiotic agar.  This procedure works for about a 10% success rate.  Usually one or two of the cultures will grow mold, one or two will grow bacteria, one will grow mushroom mycelium, and the rest just sit there doing nothing.  One of the keys for successful dry tissue recovery is to inoculate as many petri dishes as you can afford in order to use the numbers to your advantage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5809294</next>\n<prev>5808443</prev>\n<first>5808187</first>\n<last>5810914</last>\n<when>1151762115</when>\n<utime>07/01/06 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
