He obviously doesn't mind you wasting a month growing non potent mushrooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just do a search and you will see that white rice flour does not produce psylocibin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a search and you'll see people have said that about every substrate ever used.&amp;nbsp; With multispore inoculation, it's a roll of the dice what you're going to get, and noobs always think it's the substrate, not genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, white rice has far less nutrition because the outer hulls are gone, and that's where most of the fungi's food source resides.&amp;nbsp; You'll grow only a few small mushrooms if any, but to say that mushrooms grown on white rice produce no psilocybin is not correct.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12413395</prev>\n<first>12412813</first>\n<last>12413450</last>\n<when>1271597738</when>\n<utime>04/18/10 04:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
