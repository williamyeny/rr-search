The green isn't the mold and removing it only spread it around more, as well as getting it on yourself, your clothes, the walls, etc., which is going to contaminate your future projects as well.  The term 'green mold' is a misnomer.  The mold is white, just like your mushroom mycelium.  The spores are what is green.  Removing the spores is the same as scraping the black off a casing layer after a mushroom flush has dropped spores.  Will that get rid of the mushroom mycelium?  Of course not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get rid of that tub, clean out your room, yourself, everything.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, increase the size of the holes in your tub for increased air exchange, or fan more often.  Trichoderma only grows in still, stale, humid air.  With proper air exchange, it can't hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5289034</next>\n<prev>5288902</prev>\n<first>5288255</first>\n<last>5290116</last>\n<when>1139693953</when>\n<utime>02/11/06 11:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
