My wife is Russian and has taught me the language, so I was offering to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saw your response to wronguy in the other thread.  Sorry, I won't be able to help you because I'm black too.  In fact, we're all black here. I would suggest you change your name and come back with a better attitude towards those who would be in position to help you. Nobody likes a smartass.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5746765</next>\n<prev>5746726</prev>\n<first>5746569</first>\n<last>5746883</last>\n<when>1150245520</when>\n<utime>06/14/06 03:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
