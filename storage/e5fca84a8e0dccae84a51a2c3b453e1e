So how is that different from the cake your boiling? You still haven't clarified that point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cake in a jar is suspended above a pot of boiling water with a lid on it.&amp;nbsp; This creates 100% humidity in the pot above the water and below the lid.&amp;nbsp; This is what allows the substrate in the jar to reach 100C without evaporating all the moisture away.&amp;nbsp; This is why we sometimes have to add water to the boiling pot during the cycle, but not to the jars, since they don't dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your tray in the oven, you have no pot of water surrounding the substrate.&amp;nbsp; The moisture in the tray is all you have, thus by definition when it reaches 210F/100C, all the moisture will be gone due to evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can't explain it any clearer.&amp;nbsp; I wish you the best of luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19211270</next>\n<prev>19211252</prev>\n<first>19210357</first>\n<last>19215956</last>\n<when>1385900637</when>\n<utime>12/01/13 02:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
