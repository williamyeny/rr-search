In a filter patch bag, you'll have to put your nose right up against the filter to smell it.  Be sure to only sniff through the filter.  If the bag has molds and you smell it directly by opening the bag, you can breathe in possibly dangerous amounts of spores.  If you have something that makes the whole room stink, toss it out without taking a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5912217</next>\n<prev>5911570</prev>\n<first>5911570</first>\n<last>5933855</last>\n<when>1154191714</when>\n<utime>07/29/06 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
