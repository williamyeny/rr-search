So far 1 1/2 weeks in, I let them grow out for 4 days. I check on them to find very minimal sectoring (12 sections), and most of it appearing non-rizomorphic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect to make four to five transfers before you see much sectoring.&amp;nbsp; You have so many strains growing on top of each other the mycelium looks cottony as a result.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15942731</next>\n<prev>15940258</prev>\n<first>15940033</first>\n<last>15942731</last>\n<when>1331651203</when>\n<utime>03/13/12 06:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
