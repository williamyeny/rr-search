{"key":"post-5585930","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5585930</id>\n<content>Lots.  I don't recommend glass for mycology.  You need so many dishes to get anywhere, you'll be dropping and breaking the heavy, slippery glass ones, not to mention they are quite expensive.  You can get plastic pre-sterilized dishes for a dime each.  It's hard to justify the effort to clean, wash and re-sterilize the pyrex dishes, then find a way to keep them sterile until time to use, just to save a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a box of 500 dishes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cenmed.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cenmed.com&lt;/a&gt; for $50.  You'll get 25 sleeves of 20 sterile dishes in each sleeve.   Best way to go, imo.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5586254</next>\n<prev>5585910</prev>\n<first>5585910</first>\n<last>5593668</last>\n<when>1146686139</when>\n<utime>05/03/06 10:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
