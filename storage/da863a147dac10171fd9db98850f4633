Many 'organic' pesticides are more toxic than chemical ones.<br />The fungus gnats are most likely coming from your houseplants.&nbsp; Disturb the soil in each plant until you see a bunch fly out of the soil, and then discard or treat that houseplant.<br />In the fruiting chamber, they're rarely a problem.&nbsp; They're attracted to the smell of mycelium, but unless you have wet, uncolonized substrates they won't get in them and breed.&nbsp; Set a sticky trap or nearly-empty bottle of red wine nearby that they'll drown in.<br />RR"}}
