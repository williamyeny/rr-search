Strain is for the most part irrelevant to growing.  All other factors are much more important.  That's why we created the strain thread to strain questions don't clog up the main forum.  Keep it there please.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8050379</prev>\n<first>8048338</first>\n<last>8050395</last>\n<when>1203584964</when>\n<utime>02/21/08 11:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
