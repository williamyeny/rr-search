Guaranteed to work, no messy perlite, no algea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . There like $40 but reusable, perlite you have to replace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woa there now.&amp;nbsp; Perlite will probably last thousands of years since it's mineral.&amp;nbsp; A made in china ultrasonic humidifier will be lucky to last one.&amp;nbsp; Perlite isn't messy, and algae will not grow on it unless you get the wrong stuff from miracle grow with chemical 'fertilizer' in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To correct something someone else said above, you should never run a fan in the room with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Fans screw up the natural circulation in a room on which the terrarium design depends for proper operation.&amp;nbsp; Elevate the terrarium on blocks and set it on a table or shelf in an open room, not a closet.&amp;nbsp; A window should be at least partly cracked open for fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to the original poster, don't get hung up on your made in china hygrometer reading.&amp;nbsp; If you built your shotgun terrarium to specs, you can be sure your humidity and fresh air exchange are at the right level.&amp;nbsp; Never sacrifice fresh air supply in favor of humidity. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16371651</next>\n<prev>16369320</prev>\n<first>16368524</first>\n<last>16372931</last>\n<when>1339505772</when>\n<utime>06/12/12 03:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
