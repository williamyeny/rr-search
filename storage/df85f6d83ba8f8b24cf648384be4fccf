Trying to 'fix' mistakes after the fact usually results in more wasted money and time.  I'd recommend just setting those jars aside and making up a fresh batch, using less water.  Keep the mixture airy as well, don't pack it down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6041303</next>\n<prev>6041128</prev>\n<first>6041088</first>\n<last>6042252</last>\n<when>1157737985</when>\n<utime>09/08/06 08:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
