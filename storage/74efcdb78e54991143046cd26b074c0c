It could be due to the lime used in paper making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also a bit worried about the 100 ppm chromium.  I'll have to do some checking to see what the safe level in food is.  I haven't had time to do that yet.  I don't know if it came from the printing inks or not. I wonder if chromium is used in aluminum making?  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7690379</next>\n<prev>7690259</prev>\n<first>7689871</first>\n<last>19689041</last>\n<when>1196277687</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 09:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
