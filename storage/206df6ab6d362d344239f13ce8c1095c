When I'm ready to use them, I just get them down and fill.  There is really no need to even wash again.  Sterilization will take care of anything on the glass itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long ago gave up on trying to identify each and every mold.  They're all contaminants, and they're all in the air around us.  Whichever one gets to our substrate first is usually the luck of the draw.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6516348</next>\n<prev>6516237</prev>\n<first>6496369</first>\n<last>6535020</last>\n<when>1170271951</when>\n<utime>01/31/07 09:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
