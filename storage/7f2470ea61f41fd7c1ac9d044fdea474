I no longer even use half gallons for the same reason.  I've found it much better to use however many quarts are necessary for whatever projects I'm working on.   Glass also is an insulator, so it holds in heat, leading to a skyrocketing temperature as the mycelium produces heat during colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your $1.5K, spend $500 for a laminar flow hood first.  This will pay for itself in increased reliability during grain to grain transfers and agar work.   Growing large amounts of medicinal mushrooms is easy on straw.  Simply follow the straw log or laundry basket tek, and spawn the straw with your grains between ten and twenty to one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6948658</next>\n<prev>6948609</prev>\n<first>6948523</first>\n<last>6948658</last>\n<when>1179796294</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
