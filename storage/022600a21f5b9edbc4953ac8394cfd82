The other answer that 30 minutes is enough is also wrong. I'd suggest the original poster search posts for his answer, and use 'hyphae' 'agar' or myself in the username section.  Leave the other factors at their default setting.  All of this has been covered and answered in detail many times in the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6834175</prev>\n<first>6833663</first>\n<last>6834228</last>\n<when>1177554381</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 05:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
