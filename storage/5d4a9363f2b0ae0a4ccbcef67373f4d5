I would avoid keeping it damp all the time.  Take it to the sink and wash the whole block under running water, and then allow it to dry out for a day or two, and then repeat.  If the weather is in the 50's or 60's and raining, be sure to set it outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours looks to be bubbling up well, so it should fruit soon, provided it's had the drop in temps it needs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7640203</next>\n<prev>7640036</prev>\n<first>7640036</first>\n<last>7641618</last>\n<when>1195162791</when>\n<utime>11/15/07 11:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
