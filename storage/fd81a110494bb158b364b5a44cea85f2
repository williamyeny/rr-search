You can also throw in horse manure, worm castings, cow manure, compost, etc., in whatever mix you dream up at the time.  It's all good.  If your mix seems heavy, cut with up to 50% vermiculite.  Don't forget to lime to ph8 and add up to ten percent gypsum.  Don't count the verm when figuring how much gypsum or lime to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5894771</next>\n<prev>5894306</prev>\n<first>5894306</first>\n<last>5894963</last>\n<when>1153768215</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 10:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
