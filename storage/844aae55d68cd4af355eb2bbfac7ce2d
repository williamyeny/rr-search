Once your PC is at 15 psi, simply reduce the heat to the minimum setting that will keep it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't need more than 1&quot; of water in the bottom of the pc.  You can even use an empty layer of jars, then set your substrate jars above them so that they're totally out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6418023</next>\n<prev>6417927</prev>\n<first>6417288</first>\n<last>6418425</last>\n<when>1167763897</when>\n<utime>01/02/07 08:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
