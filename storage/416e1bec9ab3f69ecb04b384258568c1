They're not, nor do they need to be, sterile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash the darn thing with soap and water, and replace the perlite, or boil it for a few minutes if you wish to re-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never work naked or shirtless.  Your body is far more filthy, even right after showering, than a freshly laundred shirt is.  Remember from science class in school how many dead skin cells we shed per hour?  Those cells are covered in bacteria.  Wear clean clothes and latex gloves when doing sterile work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8463108</next>\n<prev>8463050</prev>\n<first>8461186</first>\n<last>8464171</last>\n<when>1212162558</when>\n<utime>05/30/08 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
