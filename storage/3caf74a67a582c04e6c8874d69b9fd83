After you isolated a bunch of different genomes, you would have to test the strains to see what specimen produces the best. I would avoid that and just clone from the fruit (naturally isolated and is the result if other grows are replicated precisely)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorrect.&amp;nbsp; If one is isolating strains, numerous spores are required to get the most genetic diversity.&amp;nbsp; Cloning a fruit from a flush is NOT isolating strains, and fruits can have many strains active in a single fruitbody.&amp;nbsp; When you clone it, you only get one of those strains, and may not preserve the genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inoculating loop can easily be made with very thin wire.&amp;nbsp; Use VERY thin wire so it cools down faster after heating red hot.&amp;nbsp; A paper clip will remain hot for a long time, and can kill your spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Strain-Isolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;strain isolation on agar video clip&lt;/a&gt; before starting.&amp;nbsp; It's just a sample clip-the whole tek is on the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15700977</next>\n<prev>15700159</prev>\n<first>15700123</first>\n<last>15702427</last>\n<when>1327246404</when>\n<utime>01/22/12 05:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
