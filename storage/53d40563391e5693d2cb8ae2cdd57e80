It takes days for the spores to germinate. Why wouldn't you recommend shaking the jars?&lt;br /&gt;I know it isn't absolutely necessary but it is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it's not a good idea at all.&amp;nbsp; It's better for spores to germinate in close proximity to other spores in order for them to form a coherent organism early.&amp;nbsp; Once the organism is formed, shake to disperse the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Shaking right after inoculation slows down progress. If one were following my rye prep tek, they would shake after removing the jars from the pressure cooker, and then inoculate and let sit until colonization reaches 20% to 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it doesn't take days for spores to germinate.&amp;nbsp; At normal room temperature, spores begin to germinate on grains within 20 minutes of inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12531112</next>\n<prev>12531024</prev>\n<first>12530843</first>\n<last>12854140</last>\n<when>1273422377</when>\n<utime>05/09/10 07:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
