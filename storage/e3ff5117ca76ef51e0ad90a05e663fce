Why would they do that?&amp;nbsp; It's not food for mammals and has no reason to be tested as such.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13375244</next>\n<prev>13375065</prev>\n<first>13187244</first>\n<last>13385908</last>\n<when>1287842075</when>\n<utime>10/23/10 04:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
