What I don't know is how long a strain will stay viable on a petri dish, in cold storage, compared to a culture slant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of my best commercial strains are 20 to 30 years old, so they'll stay alive in culture slants far longer than 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A petri dish has a very thin layer of nutrient, and this dries out rapidly.&amp;nbsp; A slant has more media with less surface area exposed to evaporation, plus less air space.&amp;nbsp; This means they can last for years.&amp;nbsp; In addition, plastic petri dishes respirate somewhat, while glass slant tubes do not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15941582</next>\n<prev>15941225</prev>\n<first>15936993</first>\n<last>19216800</last>\n<when>1331651009</when>\n<utime>03/13/12 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
