{"key":"post-4473978","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4473978</id>\n<content>My greenhouse is 4 x 8 x 84&quot; tall.  That one is almost twice the size.  I use two coolmists sitting on shelves within the greenhouse tied to a humidistat.  They only run five minutes or so each hour.  They only need to be filled with water every three weeks or so.  I'd say three to to four coolmists sitting inside that one will be great.  Leave the door with a loose fit for air exchange.  Note that you cant keep over about 80% humidity with coolmists so cakes are out of the question unless you keep them partially wrapped up with plastic sheeting.  It's perfect for cased substrates though.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4473985</next>\n<prev>4473968</prev>\n<first>4473632</first>\n<last>4558978</last>\n<when>1122759412</when>\n<utime>07/31/05 12:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
