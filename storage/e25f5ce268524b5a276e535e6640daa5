In addition, there should be NO standing water in a fruiting chamber.  I also doubt seriously you can exchange enough air in that glass container to fruit oysters without drying the air out.  You need to make a much larger fruiting chamber so that you can exchange more air.   Oysters are extremely CO2 intolerant.  If they fruit at all, you'll get fat stems and little to no caps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7473236</next>\n<prev>7472933</prev>\n<first>7466208</first>\n<last>7474167</last>\n<when>1191243901</when>\n<utime>10/01/07 04:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
