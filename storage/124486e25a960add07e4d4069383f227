Unfortunately, what he digs up is that lazy-ass tard's thread with all the wrong answers, so he gets his own grow screwed up by following horrible advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the reason we see people still using 'drip shields' because they read that misting kills pins. They try to cut green mold out of a jar, only to post a month or two later that every single grow gets mold.&amp;nbsp; They read posts by idiots that mushrooms 'only need enough light for you to read by', so they grow in the dark and get very low yields. They build incubators because some retard says to grow in 86F temperature, thus they cook their substrate.&amp;nbsp; I could go on and on about this crap.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15170607</prev>\n<first>15166023</first>\n<last>15170637</last>\n<when>1317649256</when>\n<utime>10/03/11 04:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
