I advise against wiping the needles with anything.&amp;nbsp; You can't get cleaner than 'red-hot'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the whole jars are green, your sterilization process didn't work. If the green is only at the inoculation sites, then your inoculation procedure or syringe itself is the problem. Use a simple kettle to boil as per the video, or use a pressure cooker properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider a glovebox a must.&amp;nbsp; It isn't necessary to use lysol or anything else in a glovebox.&amp;nbsp; Gloveboxes are only a means of stopping air currents in the room, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd discard the used syringe and use your new one.&amp;nbsp; Since you didn't use a glovebox, there's a chance that room air got sucked into the syringe, so why take a chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same videos that are on youtube are also on my website, but in much higher resolution, provided you have high speed internet service.&amp;nbsp; There's also text that fills in some of the questions that can't be easily covered in video format.&amp;nbsp; Read the brf tek page and the terrarium tek page.&amp;nbsp; The link is in my signature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8684488</next>\n<prev>8682714</prev>\n<first>8682568</first>\n<last>8705848</last>\n<when>1217084572</when>\n<utime>07/26/08 06:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
