I'm all for anything that will fruit in cooler weather.  I believe it's entirely possible to expand the natural habitat of many species.  Bear in mind, in Max's habitat, it gets cool, but not cold.  Flowers bloom in Jan/Feb at the Butchart Gardens on Vancouver Island, so don't expect what works in BC to work in Alberta or Montana.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6171730</next>\n<prev>5482451</prev>\n<first>4891516</first>\n<last>6674998</last>\n<when>1144258382</when>\n<utime>04/05/06 08:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
