Cool mist humidifiers are designed to raise humidity, not move air.  If you try to use one to move air, it will only last a very short time due to the static pressure produced, which ruins the motor and bushings.  For best results, use a humidifier for humidity, and vents for air exchange.<br />RR"}}
