The temperature differential causes the condensation, and the holes help to keep the temperature equalized, thus no condensation.  If you've dunked and rolled your cakes, you still want to mist to keep the verm damp.  If you have cased substrates, you also want to mist.  All those holes provide for constant FAE, which is a major pinning trigger, but the constatant FAE also causes evaporation from your substrate(another pinning trigger), which needs to be replaced by misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6995692</next>\n<prev>6995151</prev>\n<first>6995106</first>\n<last>6996031</last>\n<when>1180722490</when>\n<utime>06/01/07 09:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
