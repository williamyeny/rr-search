If you mist small pins, and then put the lid on the fc, they'll usually abort.  They also must be misted with a very fine mist sprayed up into the air, so that it settles down gently on the casing layer.  A direct spray will abort pins.  Never mist when they're in the promrodia stage.  Simply lay a sheet of wax paper over the top of the tray to hold humidity at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick off any moldy pins from the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6990803</next>\n<prev>6990501</prev>\n<first>6988497</first>\n<last>6991310</last>\n<when>1180627628</when>\n<utime>05/31/07 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
