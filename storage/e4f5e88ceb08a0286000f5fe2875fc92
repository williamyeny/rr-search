Normal room temperature is what I recommend for colonizing jars because heat stimulates bacteria and molds as much or more than it stimulates mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any temperature from about 74F to 80F is fine for colonization, which is easy to obtain on an open shelf, such as the top shelf of a closet where it's raised up higher in the room where the temp is a bit warmer than down low.   I haven't used an 'incubator' in many years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6835377</next>\n<prev>6831159</prev>\n<first>6831159</first>\n<last>6844633</last>\n<when>1177516942</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 07:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
