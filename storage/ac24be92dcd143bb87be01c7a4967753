Aquarium air pumps and stones don't provide enough fresh air, so that's set you back.&nbsp; Fruiting chambers should have no standing water in the perlite.&nbsp; You're not supposed to give light for 24 hours per day, so that's setting you back.<br />After all that, you're wondering why it's not fruiting after only five days?&nbsp; Five days is about right to expect pins when you do every thing right.&nbsp; Quit fixing what isn't broken(cold shock-scratching), and read some more.&nbsp; Good luck and welcome to the board.<br />RR"}}
