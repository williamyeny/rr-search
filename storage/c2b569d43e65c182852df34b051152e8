It only works as a filter if it's bone dry.<br />If your verm got wet, I'd bet it's because you didn't have the jars completely out of the water when you sterilized.&nbsp; The jars need to be on a rack above the water so that when the water boils, it doesn't splash up and get inside.&nbsp; The other thing that will get your verm damp is to leave the foil on after the PC cycle.&nbsp; Always remove the foil when you remove the jars from the sterilization pot or PC.<br />RR"}}
