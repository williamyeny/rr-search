So the steam doesn't need to travel all around the bag, the water in the bag won't boil out, and it will sterilize the bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see where you're making your mistake now.&amp;nbsp; The pressure may be equal throughout the PC, but the temperature won't if a bag is against the edge.&amp;nbsp; At 15 psi, an infrared thermometer pointed at the walls of my AA PC will barely read 150F.&amp;nbsp; If a bag is against the side of the pc, cushioned only by a rag, it probably won't even reach the boiling point in that area.&amp;nbsp; There's a huge difference between 15psi of steam, and 15 psi of mechanical pressure which is all you have if a bag is against the outside edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several PCs, ranging from an AA 921 to three AA 75X sterilizers, to a drum which holds 50 filter patch bags.&amp;nbsp; I have to be extremely careful loading them to make sure steam can penetrate all the way around each bag to ensure sterilization.&amp;nbsp; I put sterilization strips in one out of three bags for this reason to make sure.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure the OP has had his concerns addressed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10788602</next>\n<prev>10788356</prev>\n<first>10787425</first>\n<last>10794752</last>\n<when>1249269521</when>\n<utime>08/03/09 06:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
