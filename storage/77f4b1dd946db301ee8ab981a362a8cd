If you feel bad about &quot;Wasting&quot; myc, you could always toss that colonized dry layer into a compost pile and attempt to start an outdoor grow with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt; I am scratching my head about that advice. I started out growing casings so I look at things a little differently. Your jars look fine, washing and scraping seems like the wrong route to go. I believe you can just roll those bad boys in verm after full colonization. &lt;b&gt;A trusted cultivater will probably chime in and I would listen to that advice.&lt;/b&gt; I have seen some beautiful cakes on this site. Relax and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, listen to that advice.&amp;nbsp; Wash/scrape the dry verm layer off, colonized or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13186227</next>\n<prev>13186189</prev>\n<first>13182529</first>\n<last>13186471</last>\n<when>1284337336</when>\n<utime>09/13/10 03:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
