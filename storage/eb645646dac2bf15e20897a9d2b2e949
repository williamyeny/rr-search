Two holes will not 'drain' CO2 out of a terrarium.   There seems to be a mindset that CO2 is 'heavier than air' and therefore will drain out the bottom.  Such is not the case.  CO2 mixes readily with air, raising the CO2 content of the air.  It will not drain out the bottom as if it were water.  It must be forced out by fanning or turbulence.   Even my terrarium design with a hundred or more holes drilled into all six sides can benefit from a fanning or two per day.<br />If you mist, and then seal a terrarium up, it will cause aborts and/or bacterial blotch on fruits. You must increase air exchange after misting until the moisture either evaporates off the fruits, or soaks in.  High temperatures stimulate bacteria much more than mushroom mycelium, so you must lower the temperature in your growing room.  A fan won't do much except move the hot air around, which is a good thing, but you still need to lower the temp.  Try laying a clean, wet towel over the FC, and let the fan blow on that.  As the water evaporates from the towel, it will draw heat from the FC.   Another trick is to freeze plastic bottles of water and place them into the FC.  Rotate them out as they thaw and replace with freshly frozen ones.  Those 'blue ice' packages for picnics work well for this also.<br />RR"}}
