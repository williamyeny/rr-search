{"key":"post-1471881","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>1471881</id>\n<content>Sorry fugu...you're wrong.  Corn rules.  Also, don't worry bout &quot;less inoc points&quot;  Corn is bigger and the whole surface gets covered with mycelium.  That makes LOTS of mycelium to go around when you use corn for spawn.  Also, corn holds a bit more water than rye, and it colonizes faster, due to the bigger air gaps around the kernels.  When you get ready to use it as spawn, it breaks up really easily.   None of that heavy beating against a car tire just to get it outta the jar.   </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1472455</next>\n<prev>1471624</prev>\n<first>1420137</first>\n<last>11364860</last>\n<when>1050727024</when>\n<utime>04/19/03 07:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
