And to avoid this I need to take the pot off the stove and let it cool and de pressurize naturally? Is that the gist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&amp;nbsp; Never speed cool a pressure cooker. Disregard instructions that came with the chinese PC to the contrary since you're not using it to cook vegetables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the jars should be totally out of the water-not touching it at all.&amp;nbsp; It sounds like you haven't watched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek videos&lt;/a&gt; yet.&amp;nbsp; Watch all four before making your next batch.&amp;nbsp; You're also supposed to put the foil over the top, not between the lid and ring, and you remove the foil when you remove the jars from the sterilizer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15858621</next>\n<prev>15858579</prev>\n<first>15857469</first>\n<last>15865049</last>\n<when>1330130289</when>\n<utime>02/25/12 02:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
