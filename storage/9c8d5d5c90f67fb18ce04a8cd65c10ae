You can bang the jars against a tire a few to help break up the grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the temperature.  You have them too hot.  Don't go over 80 because I've seen grain jars produce anywhere from two to five degrees of heat on their own above ambient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't add CO2.  The mycelium produces it just like you do when you exhale.  The venting of your jars is to allow the &lt;i&gt;excess&lt;/i&gt; CO2 to escape.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5834439</next>\n<prev>5833982</prev>\n<first>5830347</first>\n<last>5880573</last>\n<when>1152358345</when>\n<utime>07/08/06 02:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
