{"key":"post-6331566","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6331566</id>\n<content>My point is that if you move on and also grow other species at the same time, allowing the cubes to puke spores everywhere is releasing contaminants into your greenhouse.  I've seen cubensis take over and force copes off their substrate.  I've seen cubes take over wood based substrates that were actively fruiting the cauliflower mushroom, pushing the cauliflower fungus off the substrate and the cubes then fruited on the wood.  They will also drive oyster mushrooms off a straw log.   This is what I meant by cube spores being a contaminant.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6331776</next>\n<prev>6331524</prev>\n<first>6330220</first>\n<last>6331776</last>\n<when>1165208642</when>\n<utime>12/04/06 07:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
