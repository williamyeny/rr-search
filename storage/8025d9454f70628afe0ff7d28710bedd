You know one you can set for 2 hours off, 1 minute one and it just repeats it.  I haven't seen one like that, but that way you wouldn't have to set 24 settings to change your pattern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right here bro.  I have two of them and they work wonderful.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the cyclestat 4 timer.  There's also some other neat stuff we use on that page.  The pre-wired humidistat is also a winner, but bear in mind, when it gets clogged up with spores it will die a horrible death and need to be replaced.  If you use the humidistat, be sure to pick your flushes on time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5567836</next>\n<prev>5566535</prev>\n<first>5450815</first>\n<last>5608241</last>\n<when>1146243158</when>\n<utime>04/28/06 07:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
