{"key":"post-5433035","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5433035</id>\n<content>Wax paper works well with or without a casing layer.  Also, in the link roadkill posted above I should have said I 'rarely' use a casing layer with horse manure instead of saying 'never'.  Certain species such as pans really need a casing layer to fruit properly, and of course cubes will get much bigger with the added moisture of a casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wax paper won't supply moisture to your substrate the way a casing layer will.  It only prevents excessive moisture loss and as said, provides a humid microclimate.  Perhaps the best of both worlds is to use a thin casing layer along with a sheet of wax paper laying on top.  Sorry for the confusion.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5433181</next>\n<prev>5432237</prev>\n<first>5429941</first>\n<last>5438052</last>\n<when>1143116002</when>\n<utime>03/23/06 02:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
