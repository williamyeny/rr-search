Maybe miracle will happen.</blockquote><br />Very bad idea.&nbsp; Salt is toxic to fungi, so you just set your mushroom mycelium back.&nbsp; Move it outdoors to a manure bed.&nbsp; Next time, don't make grain lc.&nbsp; I wish I had never posted that techinque years ago.&nbsp; All it does is add another vector of contamination with no benefit.&nbsp; Use grains to inoculate directly.<br />Also, never attempt to cut out mold. That spreads it even more.&nbsp; As already said, your spawn was contaminated, and yes, exposure to light and fresh air will trigger the mold to be active towards sporulation, just like it does with mushroom mycelium.<br />RR"}}
