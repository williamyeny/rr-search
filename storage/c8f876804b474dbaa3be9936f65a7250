Put half the holes you cut high, and the other half of the holes down low.<br />That is just about the size of my greenhouse, and the above is what I use.  I have no problem getting 95% humidity.  <br />You can at least double up on the number of shelves in that greenhouse, and put another shelf in the back.  There's a lot of wasted walking space in there.<br />If you need even more humidity until you get it filled up, you can put trays of damp perlite everywhere you don't have a project sitting.  It can sometimes be hard to keep enough humidity in an empty greenhouse.<br />RR"}}
