Get it wet, drain well, then dump it in two to three inches deep.<br />Never put the cakes on the perlite.  Set them on jar lids or something similar.  They'll become waterlogged sitting directly on perlite.<br />You can use the search feature to find all you want to know about terrariums, but with an aquarium, perlite on the bottom, and a piece of plexiglass on top, you have a terrarium.  Open it several times per day to fan out. Just use the lid and fan several times back and forth with it to exchange the air.<br />It's considered bad form to bump your own post without giving 24 hours for response first.<br />RR"}}
