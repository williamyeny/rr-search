(happened to me)  and that was only peeking at day 2 and 3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't the light.  Light is a secondary pinning trigger.  Peeking exposes the substrate to fresh air, and a reduction of CO2, which is a primary pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6929353</next>\n<prev>6927842</prev>\n<first>6924855</first>\n<last>6929353</last>\n<when>1179412783</when>\n<utime>05/17/07 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
