Colonize at normal room temperature for the most dependable results. During fruiting, place the tubs in very bright light such as an east or south facing window(if you're in the northern hemisphere) and let them get at least a few minutes each day of direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunlight and/or bright fluorescent light will trigger heavier fruits with shorter, fatter stems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll put some holes in the box or give more frequent air exchanges, the stems will not stretch so much.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18806039</next>\n<prev>18574037</prev>\n<first>18561085</first>\n<last>18822535</last>\n<when>1374126650</when>\n<utime>07/18/13 08:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
