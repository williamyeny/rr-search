Just place one outside of your monotub, above the lid. in my experience mushrooms could really care less about how much light they receive &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lighting is EXTREMELY important for a good pinset.  Cubes will fruit in very low light conditions, but bright fluorescent light will help to trigger the pinsets the old timers show all the time that makes folks drool.  Actually, you're probably right.  The mushrooms don't care that much about light, but the mycelium sure as heck does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lights, especially fluroescent, should be OUTside the terrarium, but near enough to flood the fruiting chamber in bright, high frequency light. Don't put the ballast outside and the lamps inside.  The tombstones have a fairly high voltage potiential across them, and wrapping a warm item in plastic in a wet environment is. . .dumb. There isn't much more useless than 'blue' mood lights, especially from led's.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7967953</next>\n<prev>7967694</prev>\n<first>7964762</first>\n<last>12155531</last>\n<when>1201966054</when>\n<utime>02/02/08 05:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
