(we didn't see either of them until the next afternoon) &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mushroom2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot; title=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gaston was just about to take the stage to speak when I dropped a handful of cyans into his lap.&amp;nbsp; They were growing about 50 feet from the side door of the auditorium.&amp;nbsp; There was over 1000 mycophiles there and nobody had thought to check the old, neglected Rhododendron patch behind the building, which had a full flush of several thousand wavy caps under the bushes!&amp;nbsp; Mrs Rabbit found them first. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19585386</next>\n<prev>19584939</prev>\n<first>19584261</first>\n<last>19588374</last>\n<when>1392756567</when>\n<utime>02/18/14 10:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
