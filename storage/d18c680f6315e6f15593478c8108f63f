They grow well on horse manure with thin substrates and a very thin peat/verm casing layer.  Strain really doesn't matter any more than it matters with cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P cyans and azures are for outdoor grows in the proper climate. A few expert growers have managed to get a couple of small harvests indoors, but it's certainly not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edibles and medicinals are also a lot of fun and very healthy too, not to mention great cover for your hobby from relatives.  Just give them a bowl of oysters and they'll always love ya.  Reishi is extremely easy to grow and a great one to learn sawdust substrates, and oysters grow great on straw logs or sawdust.  See the other thread in this forum on edibles for more information.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6217444</next>\n<prev>6217380</prev>\n<first>6217380</first>\n<last>6217444</last>\n<when>1161963724</when>\n<utime>10/27/06 06:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
