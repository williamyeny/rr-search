Cobweb is airy and looks very much like an old spider web, only thicker.  Your mycelium is slightly rhizomorphic and white, while cobweb never is rhizomorphic, and is grey in color. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your first picture above shows distinct 'fans' of mycelium at the top of the image.

Peroxide will always shrink healthy mycelium because it's catastrophic on the cellular level to fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5972493</next>\n<prev>5972150</prev>\n<first>5971671</first>\n<last>5987523</last>\n<when>1155825882</when>\n<utime>08/17/06 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
