Don't do that any more please. This is going to come to a stop now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're melting bags you're using a gas stove and letting the flame curl around the edges and up the sides.&amp;nbsp; Either turn the darn flame down so that doesn't happen or move to an electric stove.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19695589</next>\n<prev>19694629</prev>\n<first>19694600</first>\n<last>19701028</last>\n<when>1394815398</when>\n<utime>03/14/14 07:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
