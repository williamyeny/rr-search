Rather than the word 'than', I meant to type 'then,'. It's best not to re-case after a dunk.&amp;nbsp; Good catch and thanks for finding that typo.&amp;nbsp; It should have been the word &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; followed by a comma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recasing tends to favor contaminants because mold spores are constantly landing on your bulk substrate, and if you apply a casing layer over these mold spores, it protects them so they can germinate easier.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16110940</next>\n<prev>16110707</prev>\n<first>15885220</first>\n<last>17046253</last>\n<when>1334848120</when>\n<utime>04/19/12 06:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
