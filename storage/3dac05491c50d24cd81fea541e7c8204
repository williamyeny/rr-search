It sounds like they just dried out during colonization is all.  Your perlite will hold up well.  I have a terrarium with three inches of damp, but not wet perlite and it's been well over a month without adding moisture to it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your cakes are really dry, you can use a syringe to inject a bit of water into them.  Rinse the syringe well, but it doesn't need to be sterile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6244366</next>\n<prev>6244082</prev>\n<first>6243635</first>\n<last>6248938</last>\n<when>1162592846</when>\n<utime>11/04/06 12:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
