{"key":"post-6607072","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6607072</id>\n<content>Penicillium is extremely rare in jars, but that u-tube video that's making the rounds misidentifies trichoderma as 'green penicillium mold', even though penicillium is blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When molds show up low in a jar, it indicates the contaminant entered during the inoculation process.  This could be from a contaminated syringe, or could be from allowing the jars to sit for too long before inoculating them.  If contaminants are on the top dry verm layer, and you stick a syringe through, you can push the contaminants right down into your substrate.  It's good practice to use medical tape on the jar holes during sterilization, and either remove the tape at inoculation time, or scrub it with alcohol and stick the needle right through.  This prevents contaminants from landing on the vermiculite barrier prior to inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6606859</prev>\n<first>6603383</first>\n<last>6607072</last>\n<when>1172383110</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 07:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
