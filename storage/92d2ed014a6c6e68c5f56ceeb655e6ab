If you're getting green molds, then you need more air exchange.  If your casing mix was not properly pasteurized, it would have contaminated before the first flush was finished. I do not recommend sterilizing casing.  Pasteurize only.  Trichoderma and other mold spores are killed off by fairly low temperatures in the 120F to 130F range.  The bacteria that survive pasteurization will help protect your casing layer from molds later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to run HEPA filters in every room of my house.  They're now all in the storage building collecting dust.  I honestly feel a HEPA filter near the grow room does more harm than good by stirring up the air and blowing contaminant spores around that would otherwise sink harmlessly to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exchange the air more often in your growing chamber and I'm sure you'll see less problems.  After the end of the second flush, toss the tray out and replace with another.  You'll get 90% or more of the fruits from a casing in the first two flushes, unlike cakes which sometimes go for 4 or 5 flushes.  Don't risk contaminants by trying to get that last ten percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't put your fruiting chamber anywhere near the floor.  90% of all contaminants are within 12&quot; of the floor, and it's much worse if you have carpet.  Be sure your terrarium or other FC is raised up on a shelf.  The higher the better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5166361</next>\n<prev>5165820</prev>\n<first>5164236</first>\n<last>5171628</last>\n<when>1136980160</when>\n<utime>01/11/06 01:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
