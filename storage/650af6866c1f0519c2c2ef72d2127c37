Don't use 60% coir or you'll have overlay problems.<br />The microwave is partial sterilization due to the very hot temperatures.  <br />You can pasteurize using the pc by loading your already moistened casing material into quart jars and placing in the pc full of <i>cold</i> water  2/3 the way up the jars.  Turn on the stove and bring the water to a very near boil, then shut off the stove and let the jars sit in the hot water.  Keep the pc covered.   In fifteen minutes, bring once again to a near boil, then shut off the stove.  Remove the jars after another hour and they'll be perfect. The internal temp of the casing material will be 140-160 for over an hour, but will not exceed 170 during that time.<br />RR"}}
