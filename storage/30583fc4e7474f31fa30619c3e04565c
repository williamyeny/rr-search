The casing is not the substrate itself.<br />You don't set your bulk substrates on perlite.  Actually, you wouldn't set your cakes on perlite either or they become waterlogged.  The perlite is for humidification purposes, not substrate moisture replenishment.<br />Scraping is when you 'rake' the casing layer.  It's useful for some species just as the mycelium begins to reach the top of the casing layer.  Most cubensis growers apply a 'patch' to the first mycelium to show rather than scratch the surface.  I've found scraping or scratching is effective especially for shaggy manes and other very fast growing edibles, but less useful when used with cubensis.  It's also a cure for 'overlay' but I hesitate to even use that word here because it's so rare.  A couple of months ago it seemed half the posts were asking if they had overlay, when none did.<br />After you patch, or if you chose not to patch, you put the cased substrate into fruiting conditions when the mycelium reaches the surface of the casing layer.<br />G2G is short for 'grain to grain' transfer.  It's when you break up a jar of rye or other grains, then transfer a tablespoon or so worth of grains to each of ten to twenty new jars.  It's a great way to expand your mycelium.<br />Usually when jars stall, it's because the grower forgot to remove the tape from the holes.  Mycelium needs gas exchange and a small oxygen supply in order to grow.  The biggest reason to flip jars if the bottom isn't colonizing is if they are too wet, the excess moisture will run the other way, allowing the bottom to colonize.  Many growers assume it's to let the CO2 out, but that is incorrect.  The heat produced by the colonizing mycelium will cause convection that will easily vent the CO2 with the jars upright.  Hope this helps.<br />RR"}}
