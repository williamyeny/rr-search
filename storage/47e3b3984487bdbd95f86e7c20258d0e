All molds are dangerous to your crop, so not to be messed with.  I recommend tossing out any cake or casing as soon as molds are discovered.  Brown molds are especially toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question was concerning green molds however, and the safety of eating a mushroom from a substrate or casing that has a green mold on it.  There are no known green molds that are toxic to humans.  That is a fact.  Toxic or not however, I wouldn't eat the green mold itself, and certainly wouldn't eat the cake or other substrate.  The mushroom itself however will be perfectly safe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4274929</next>\n<prev>4272130</prev>\n<first>4247045</first>\n<last>27024241</last>\n<when>1118268078</when>\n<utime>06/09/05 01:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
