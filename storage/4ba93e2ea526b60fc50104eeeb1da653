{"key":"post-6890425","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6890425</id>\n<content>If you'll use the link above for 'search posts', and use strain isolation as the search term, and my name in the username block, you'll get a few hundred posts where I've talked about agar and strain isolation.  In addition, my soon to be released DVD set has a whole section on mixing agar, pouring petri dishes, strain isolation, and a demonstration of inoculating rye jars with agar wedges.  I'm sure it will help a lot as well.   Good luck.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6890492</next>\n<prev>6890387</prev>\n<first>6890387</first>\n<last>6890492</last>\n<when>1178673169</when>\n<utime>05/09/07 04:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
