When you use multispore inoculation, you're inoculating with hundreds, or even thousands of strains. The process of anastomosis causes these strains to combine into one or two by the time fruiting comes around. It doesn't make a hill of beans difference if one print came from cambodia and the other print came from mars or saturn if they're the same species.  Experiment away.  I've proved this dozens of times.  There should be no reduction in yield.  If there is, then other factors are at play.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5767603</prev>\n<first>5767596</first>\n<last>5768674</last>\n<when>1150755782</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 01:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
