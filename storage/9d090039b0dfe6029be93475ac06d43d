So there aren't many nutrients left for the fruiting process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why we mix our grains with a nutritious substrate such as poo or coir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is completely wrong too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grains are far more nutritious than manure.&amp;nbsp; The grains are still providing a major part of the nutrition at fruiting, even when manure is used.&amp;nbsp; The manure is a bulk substrate, meaning it must be used in bulk, while a very small amount of grains(cased) will provide a decent flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17736919</next>\n<prev>17736911</prev>\n<first>17730619</first>\n<last>17798254</last>\n<when>1359896250</when>\n<utime>02/03/13 02:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
