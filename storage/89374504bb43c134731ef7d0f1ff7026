Perhaps you didn't provide gas exchange?  In tens of thousands of grain jars, I've never seen one stall and stop growing without a contaminant present.  Mycelium doesn't simply 'stall' if moisture content is right and it has gas exchange.  Check through the gas exchange holes for a bad smell.  If bacteria is present, it will be noticable through the filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6719356</prev>\n<first>6716730</first>\n<last>6719367</last>\n<when>1175094724</when>\n<utime>03/28/07 06:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
