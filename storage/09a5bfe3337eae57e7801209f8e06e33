Mushroom mycelium can have several types from cottony to rhizomorphic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed of colonization falls off very rapidly at 86F and above, and that figure is for mycelium temperature, not air temperature.  Mycelium temperature is always a few degrees higher due to thermogenesis.  I prefer 70F to 80F for an ambient air temperature.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The biggest cause besides contaminants for stalled jars however, is running out of oxygen.  Make sure the holes are open so gasses can exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6321849</prev>\n<first>6321849</first>\n<last>6322116</last>\n<when>1164932177</when>\n<utime>12/01/06 02:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
