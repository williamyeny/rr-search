Just don't push it by trying to case the grains too early.  Let them sit after they appear fully colonized for a few days.  Break them up and apply 1/4&quot; or so of casing, and then cover with foil for a week.  After that, which is going to be around march 1, expose to fruiting conditions and expect to harvest a week or two later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8002471</prev>\n<first>7989296</first>\n<last>8002875</last>\n<when>1202620449</when>\n<utime>02/10/08 07:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
