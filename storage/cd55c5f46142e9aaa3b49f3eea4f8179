Vermiculite is an excellent moisture reservoir, that holds more water for its size than anything else.  Any substrate, including sawdust/woodchips or manure can benefit from the addition of vermiculite.  There is also no other method of growing that can grow more mushrooms on less substrate than pf cakes.  That's a fact.<br />You don't find any of the old timers trashing pf tek.  It's not about ego, it's about more than one way to skin a cat.  Pf cakes have the highest BE of any growing method, bar none.<br />Don't replace verm with potting soil.  They're apples and oranges.<br />RR"}}
