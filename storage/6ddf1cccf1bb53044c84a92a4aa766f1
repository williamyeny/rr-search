I found 4&quot; septic tank fittings that had a screw on nut on the back side that fit perfectly through the hole.  I attached tyvek sleeves to the PVC fitting, then I just stick my hands with latex gloves right through the sleeves.  Works like a charm and lets me keep my alcohol torch on the outside where it won't heat up the glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4507073</next>\n<prev>4503385</prev>\n<first>4486451</first>\n<last>4507073</last>\n<when>1123363167</when>\n<utime>08/07/05 12:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
