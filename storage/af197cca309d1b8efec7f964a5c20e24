The other part is that pins for second, third, and future flushes often form during the time of first flush.  If you go cheapie on the light after the first flush is set, you hinder primordia development for future flushes.  Mushroom mycelium has circadian rhythms just like humans.  Give them a day/night cycle and they'll be much happier over the course of several flushes.<br />RR"}}
