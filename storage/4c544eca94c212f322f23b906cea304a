{"key":"post-5525382","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5525382</id>\n<content>The trick is to get a good cycle timer for your lighting that you can match with your capture rate for the security camera.  It can be a real pain in the ass getting two different timers synched up.  I found a good one, so let me know if you need the url.  When I do time lapse movies, I set the lights to come on 30 seconds before the capture.  This gives the auto focus time to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5525388</next>\n<prev>5525367</prev>\n<first>5524899</first>\n<last>5525573</last>\n<when>1145307758</when>\n<utime>04/18/06 12:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
