Peat has a ph of 5 or so, which is the favorite range for green molds.  By liming the casing layer to an initial ph of 8, the mushroom mycelium can still colonize and use it, but the contaminant molds won't be able to get a foothold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum won't swing your ph either way.  It will just tend to keep it where it is, so you need to be sure to use some sort of buffer such as lime to adjust the ph.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6025145</next>\n<prev>6024881</prev>\n<first>6024699</first>\n<last>6030804</last>\n<when>1157311998</when>\n<utime>09/03/06 10:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
