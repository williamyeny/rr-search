I already know you like to use lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then your opinion is null and void, because that is my farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already experimented for 40 years, so I'm not about to repeat experiments I did with lighting over the years, impacting my livelihood just to prove a point for the thousandth time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what you want is a 'paper' written by some college kid instead of a mushroom farmer with four decades of experience growing mushrooms, then I suggest you seek such a thing and follow that advice.&amp;nbsp; Every mushroom farm I know keeps their secrets very closely guarded.&amp;nbsp; They want every competitive advantage over other farms.&amp;nbsp; I'm the only one I know who freely shares the knowledge I've gained from actual experience.&amp;nbsp; If you chose not to accept it, no problem.&amp;nbsp; There's no law that says you have to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wholesale my mushrooms for $6 per pound and sell to distributors for only $5 per pound, so the difference of only fifty to a hundred pounds a week means making a living or going broke.&amp;nbsp; I don't run expensive bright lights because I think they look pretty. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13167206</next>\n<prev>13166381</prev>\n<first>13164059</first>\n<last>20624415</last>\n<when>1283994762</when>\n<utime>09/09/10 04:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
