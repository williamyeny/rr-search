Perhaps try ordering bags from a different supplier. Of course, you need something on the bottom to elevate them away from the direct heat of the burner, but with an electric stove, the sides shouldn't be hot enough to hurt the bags. Sometimes this is a problem with gas stoves if the flame curls around the PC and up the sides. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7821039</next>\n<prev>7820983</prev>\n<first>7820672</first>\n<last>7821375</last>\n<when>1199236585</when>\n<utime>01/02/08 03:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
