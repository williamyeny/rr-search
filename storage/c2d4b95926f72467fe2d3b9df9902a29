Another easy way to tell bruising from green molds is to look at the spot with a magnifying glass.  Bruising will be the actual color of the mycelium, while trichoderma spores will be sitting on &lt;i&gt;top of the mycelium&lt;/i&gt; as a separate layer.  You can see this with the naked eye, but a magnifying glass makes it much more distinct.  Remember, some strains such as Redboy bruise green, so don't throw out something until you've checked closely.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6208292</prev>\n<first>6207193</first>\n<last>6208788</last>\n<when>1161752005</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
