Nobody can answer that question but you.  As said above, prepare you rye properly and don't dilute it with vermiculite.  That's a bogus tek to help beginners get away with being sloppy.  In addition, because the verm soaks up the excess water, you never learn to prepare grains properly.  It's sort of like never taking the training wheels off your bike.  They'd look pretty silly on a Harley someday.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6743744</prev>\n<first>6743270</first>\n<last>6743802</last>\n<when>1175652468</when>\n<utime>04/04/07 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
