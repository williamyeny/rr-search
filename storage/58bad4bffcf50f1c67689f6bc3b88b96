Once you've removed the contaminated stuff and wiped down surfaces, you're about as good as you're going to get.  A good bleach/vinegar bomb in the air will help prevent contamination in future inoculations.  Be sure to dilute the bleach before adding any vinegar though.  Mist the air and surfaces before you attempt inoculations, but simply washing the FC itself out is good enough.  The mold spores will wash down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they flushed once, I'd speculate a lack of fresh air exchange led to the mold.  If the cakes mold before first flush, it's usually an indication of a contaminated inoculation process.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8463330</next>\n<prev>8463155</prev>\n<first>8461186</first>\n<last>8464171</last>\n<when>1212164741</when>\n<utime>05/30/08 07:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
