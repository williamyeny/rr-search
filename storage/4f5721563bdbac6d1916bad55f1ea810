{"key":"post-4483126","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4483126</id>\n<content>Popcorn is the worst possible choice of grains for mycology.  It has heat resistant bacterial endospores that have been known to survive TWO hours at 15PSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, placing popcorn in a PC without it being in jars is taking a big chance on ruining your PC.   Several growers have found those endospores stuck in the pores of the aluminum, thus contaminating the PC itself.  If you insist on using popcorn, always have it in jars with proper filters before you put it into the PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best bet if you're stuck on popcorn would be to give it a 36 hour soak in a plastic container in warm water.  This should germinate the endospores into live bacteria, thus making them easier to kill in the PC.   You'll still need a simmer to get the corn hydrated to the proper moisture content.  The kernels should be about double the original dry size.  Then, load into jars and PC for two hours at 15 psi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4483421</next>\n<prev>4481590</prev>\n<first>4480753</first>\n<last>4483421</last>\n<when>1122955416</when>\n<utime>08/02/05 07:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
