Better toss it all out then.  Some of the grey spored molds can be quite toxic, so don't eat any fruits that have the mold on them.  Next grow, be sure to toss out anything like that the very first day you see it.  Don't allow it to get that bad.  Throw out everything, perlite and all.  Don't try to save it with bleach or something like that.  Bleach doesn't kill molds, contrary to popular belief.<br />RR"}}
