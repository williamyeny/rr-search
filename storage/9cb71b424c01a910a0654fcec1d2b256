I wash the old casing material off prior to the dunk under a faucet of running tap water. I've found it's best to dunk in the refrigerator. This is not for cold shocking which is a myth(for cubensis), but instead to keep bacteria under control during the dunk. After dunking, I always rinse under the kitchen faucet once again to remove that nasty slime gilbert mentioned.  Re-case and place back in fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3911267</next>\n<prev>3911157</prev>\n<first>3910329</first>\n<last>6850481</last>\n<when>1110739786</when>\n<utime>03/13/05 08:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
