Early growers used rye grass seed and wrote about it, but other types work too, as do most grains. I've successfully grown sclerotia producing species on every type of grass seed I've ever found in local garden centers.&amp;nbsp; Most but not all have a small amount of rye grass mixed in them, but fescue and the other types work equally well.&amp;nbsp; When you hydrate with liquid coffee, dump the spent grinds into the mix too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16415490</next>\n<prev>16412928</prev>\n<first>16412579</first>\n<last>16415490</last>\n<when>1340287212</when>\n<utime>06/21/12 05:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
