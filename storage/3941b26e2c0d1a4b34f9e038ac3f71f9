The specific mushroom in this picture had a large puffy base as well, that made it difficult to harvest, it was really on the cake and had to basically be ripped off. After it was dried I wasn't really wanting to eat the puffy base so I snipped it with scissors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, snip off the base before picking so you don't destroy the cake/substrate by tearing the mushroom out.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to harvest by slicing the mushrooms off with a sharp knife, not ripping them out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>16983058</prev>\n<first>16982963</first>\n<last>16983159</last>\n<when>1349628192</when>\n<utime>10/07/12 07:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
