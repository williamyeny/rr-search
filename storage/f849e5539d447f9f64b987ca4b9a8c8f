By the time fruiting comes, CO2 production has fallen off dramatically.  You want large amounts of air exchange in order to prevent contaminants such as cobweb which thrive in stale, still air.  Have several vents both top and bottom in a FC, so you can get circulation as well as intake and exhaust.  Positive pressure is not necessary.  A FC by nature isn't sterile, nor does it need to be.  Just keep the humidity up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5925636</prev>\n<first>5925165</first>\n<last>5925645</last>\n<when>1154550842</when>\n<utime>08/02/06 11:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
