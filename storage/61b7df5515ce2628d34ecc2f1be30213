Don't pay retail coffee prices for substrate.  If however, one is a coffee addict like me, it makes sense to use the leftover grinds rather than throwing them away.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The figure I gave for hydrated lime is to use with just about everything except peat, in which you would double that amount.  1/2 teaspoon per cup will swing the ph 1 point or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should pasteurize the coir.  Some, including me have used it unpasteurized with success, but additives such as compost and/or manure definitely need to be pasteurized, so just do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use urea.  If you feel you need a nitrogen boost, use chicken manure, but at no more than 5% of the total bulk substrate.  Make sure the chicken manure has cured in the sun for at least a week or two and has zero smell.  Otherwise, spread it out on cardboard in the sun until it's dry and odor free.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6041648</next>\n<prev>6041469</prev>\n<first>6041409</first>\n<last>6047692</last>\n<when>1157747158</when>\n<utime>09/08/06 11:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
