The only similarity is that certain mold spores are dangerous to breathe, and can result in respiratory problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green molds common to mushroom cultivation are not harmful to healthy humans.  Bacterial contamination can cause food poisoning, so be sure to not eat rotten mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss out any jars with molds as soon as they're detected.  This is not to protect you the grower but to protect your crop from infection.  Don't do anything stupid such as sniff a jar of moldy product, because as said above, the inhaled spores can cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6124491</prev>\n<first>6124015</first>\n<last>6124562</last>\n<when>1159817512</when>\n<utime>10/02/06 10:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
