After shaking the jar of grains to break them up, you can pour nearly a full pint of sterilized water into the jar, then shake again.   Since there are nutrients in the &lt;i&gt;grain juice&lt;/i&gt;/mycelium, you only need to pull a small amount of this solution into each syringe.  Finish filling the syringe with sterilized water, and the mycelium will grow into it, expanding by several factors within a week.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7399788</next>\n<prev>7398453</prev>\n<first>7397578</first>\n<last>7399788</last>\n<when>1189567940</when>\n<utime>09/12/07 06:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
