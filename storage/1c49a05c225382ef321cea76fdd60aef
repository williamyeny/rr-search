The backpressure forces water into the bushings, which ruins them, and the increased load burns out the motor.  That is a fact.  Nobody thought it up.  Also, an induction motor is very capable of 'burning up'.  It has windings and current flow.  The presence of brushes has nothing to do with whether a motor can burn up or not.  With bad bushings, the excess current flow caused by the increased load smokes the windings.<br />RR"}}
