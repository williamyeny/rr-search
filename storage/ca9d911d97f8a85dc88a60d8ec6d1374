It's somebody else with the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to all to build a glovebox and pour some petri dishes to start spores on.  That eliminates the guesswork.  If the spores germinate on the agar, they're good.  If not, they're bunk.   There's nothing hard or magical about doing agar work.  It's easy.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6403281</next>\n<prev>6399014</prev>\n<first>6381218</first>\n<last>6406360</last>\n<when>1166896062</when>\n<utime>12/23/06 07:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
