When you open the bag, if you smell ammonia, lay it out on a tarp in the sun/air for a few days before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix the ingredients in any proportion you dream up.  Since any one of them can be used as a substrate by itself, &lt;u&gt;there's no rules&lt;/u&gt; on how to mix them all together.  Just add verm or coir if the mix seems too heavy.  You want a light, fluffy mix that has lots of air pockets inside so the mycelium can colonize it easily and fast.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6529483</next>\n<prev>6529168</prev>\n<first>6523812</first>\n<last>6529561</last>\n<when>1170611961</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 07:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
