{"key":"post-6651983","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6651983</id>\n<content>Sterility is important when working with uncolonized spawn.  Air exchange is more important with fruiting chambers.  I'm in a very old building that actually should be condemned due to molds in the structure.  My FC's are stacked up against a wall that has black mold coming through.  The FC's are 18&quot; from this growth of black mold.  None of it has ever infected the substrates, and I've been using that location for a couple of years now.  FAE is the key, not filtered air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no link to this method, just what I've described here.  Just trying to help.  Good luck all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6652031</next>\n<prev>6651948</prev>\n<first>6644412</first>\n<last>12312764</last>\n<when>1173448682</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 03:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
