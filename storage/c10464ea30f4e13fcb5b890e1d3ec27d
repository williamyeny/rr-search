Try again with agar and isolate a few substrains.  I've had the best luck with finding fruiting strains of mexicana by leaving in the petri dish for a month or two.  Sclerotia will form in a petri dish within three weeks if you have a good producer.  Within two to three weeks after that, fruits will form from the slerotia if it's a decent fruiting strain.  At that time, transfer the best fruiting strain on agar over to rye grain or grass seed(I prefer rye berries to grass seed) to a tray and case. Cold shocking is not necessary with the mexicana species.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-10/058927567-Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-10/058927567-thumb_Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4266298</next>\n<prev>4264382</prev>\n<first>4255700</first>\n<last>4270554</last>\n<when>1118096477</when>\n<utime>06/07/05 01:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
