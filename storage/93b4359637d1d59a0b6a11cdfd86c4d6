You're not going to dump your grain out on the floor of the box.  Just wash the inside of the box with soap and water, put the lid on and go to work.  I use the 'five seconds rule' when working in a gb.  Never have a jar or petri dish open for more than five seconds.  Plan ahead, work accurately and a glovebox can return almost as good a result as a flowhood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4720132</next>\n<prev>4717101</prev>\n<first>4712227</first>\n<last>4896802</last>\n<when>1127844727</when>\n<utime>09/27/05 09:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
