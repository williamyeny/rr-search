Make sure you decrease your fruiting chamber humidity a few hours before harvest, and don't mist.  Allow the substrate and the mushrooms themselves to dry out a bit.  This keeps them fresher in the refrigerator than if they're soggy wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't freeze any mushrooms until after they've been cooked.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7349719</next>\n<prev>7349632</prev>\n<first>7349277</first>\n<last>7349719</last>\n<when>1188438960</when>\n<utime>08/30/07 04:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
