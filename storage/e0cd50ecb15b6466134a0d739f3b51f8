You must spray a casing during a flush to replace the water being drawn up into the fruits.  You're supposed to avoid misting for a few days as hyphal knots are forming and turning into primordia, but after that, pick up misting again.  The important thing is to increase air exchange afterwards so the fruits don't sit there wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms will also absorb water through the fruits themselves.  Go ahead and mist away.  Get down close and spray or pour water on the casing between the fruits, then spray the mushrooms themselves.  Leave the lid off the tub for an hour or so afterward until the moisture evaporates of the mushrooms and/or soaks in.   The only problem is if you spray heavily, then close everything up and leave it wet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6620050</next>\n<prev>6619988</prev>\n<first>6619988</first>\n<last>6620412</last>\n<when>1172684815</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 07:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
