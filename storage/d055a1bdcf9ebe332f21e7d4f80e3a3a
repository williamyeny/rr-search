Thanks.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back to on-topic myth busting if you guys can think of any more.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9449116</next>\n<prev>9448823</prev>\n<first>9435695</first>\n<last>24354461</last>\n<when>1229528725</when>\n<utime>12/17/08 05:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
