Trich likes warm, wet, still environments, which is exactly what you have in an incubator. Personally, I do NOT recommend using an incubator with cased substrates.  Use room temperature(72F-76F).  The extra day or two it takes to colonize will pay dividends in lower contamination rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to avoiding trich is air exchange.  Since the spores will land on your project no matter what you do, prevent them from germinating and growing by giving your project plenty of fresh air exchange.  The mold such as in your second picture can only grow in a stale, wet, warm environment.  It's also important to pasteurize your casing material, never sterilize.  If you sterilize your casing material, not only will your pinsets suffer, but the casing is much more likely to contaminate.  The beneficial bacteria that survive the pasterurization temps(150F in the core of the substrate for an hour) will help prevent molds.  Sterilization kills these beneficial bacteria, increasing your chances for green molds to form later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5576209</next>\n<prev>5568719</prev>\n<first>5568719</first>\n<last>5578582</last>\n<when>1146415831</when>\n<utime>04/30/06 07:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
