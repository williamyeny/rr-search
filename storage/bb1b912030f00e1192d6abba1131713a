If you're getting pins then the substrate is fully colonized.  Now, that being said, full colonization is reached when the entire substrate is colonized by mushroom mycelium, OR when part of it is colonized by a contaminant and the mushroom mycelium runs up against the contaminant.  Either way, the substrate is fully colonized by &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. 7 weeks is way too long to keep anything in the jar.  That's why you have pins.  It has little to nothing to do with light exposure.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably have some bacterial contamination, and the mushroom mycelium has ran up against that and stopped.  The natural response in a case like this is for the mycelium to try to reproduce before it dies.  That's why fruit bodies are formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A properly made BRF cake will fully colonize in two to three weeks.  If it doesn't, something is wrong. Usually, this can be traced to using a silly incubator that keeps the temperature too high, thus favoring bacteria and thermophilic molds over the mushroom mycelium, which thrives at normal room temperature. During that two to three week period, light exposure is irrelevant.  I colonize jars on an open shelf at normal room temperature and exposed to normal room lighting for up to 18 hours per day if I'm in there working, because that room is also my office, and they NEVER pin early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest birthing yours and washing them under the faucet in the sink and breaking/rinsing the uncolonized parts off, then dunk and roll before placing into a fruiting chamber.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6834793</next>\n<prev>6833941</prev>\n<first>6833720</first>\n<last>6836376</last>\n<when>1177554001</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 05:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
