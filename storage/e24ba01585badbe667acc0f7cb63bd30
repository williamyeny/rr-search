A sterilized casing material will allow anything that gets on it to grow.  A pasteurized casing material is 'alive' and resistant to molds.  This has all been written and documented well, and you'll find it with some searching.<br />Ovens are terrible for mycology, so I don't recommend them for anything because they dry out the material so fast and air is a poor way to transfer heat.  Water works much better.  You can put pre moistened casing material into jars or bags and submerge them in water in a kettle on the stove.  You want the center of your field capacity casing mixture to reach a temperature of 140F to 160F for an hour to an hour and a half, but no more.  Use a meat thermometer to tweak your own system.<br />RR"}}
