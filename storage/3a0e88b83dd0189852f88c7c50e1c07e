You'll get 20 for the price of two, and you don't have to go through the process of washing, re-sterilizing, and then keeping sterile until use of the glass ones.  I donated all my glass petri dishes to a local school years ago because they're such a pain in the butt to use.  You'll go through at least 50+ petri dishes to isolate a few strains from a single swipe of spores, so the glass ones are not only expensive, but very heavy and awkward to use, especially with alcohol soaked gloves on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't be fooled by wall to wall flushes.  If you have an isolate that covers the whole casing surface with pins, the fruits will be smaller, thus not affecting total harvest that much.  I select isolates for the 'other' qualities we love, as well as large, well formed and dense fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6550085</next>\n<prev>6550011</prev>\n<first>6549750</first>\n<last>6557448</last>\n<when>1171125288</when>\n<utime>02/10/07 06:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
