It gets down below that sometimes, but not all of the time. If I were to have some going outdoors just in the ground, would the chances of them surviving in temperatures such as this be slim? Or would I need to find a way for them to become warmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They'll be fine.&amp;nbsp; In my climate, cubes can't even be grown outdoors, no matter what.&amp;nbsp; We get frost here about three times per week in June, July, and August.&amp;nbsp; You'll be OK.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15206069</next>\n<prev>15203784</prev>\n<first>15202465</first>\n<last>15207058</last>\n<when>1318262110</when>\n<utime>10/10/11 06:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
