Not all strains are compatible and they don't merge into a single organism.&amp;nbsp; Therefore you have more than one strain fruiting on the same substrate.&amp;nbsp; Generally, clusters produce more product, so you might try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Mushroom-Cloning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;cloning&lt;/a&gt; from a cluster if they also have the other qualities you're seeking.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16390161</next>\n<prev>16389990</prev>\n<first>16387960</first>\n<last>19119284</last>\n<when>1339870998</when>\n<utime>06/16/12 09:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
