You want lots of fresh air, and then you mist to make up for the moisture that evaporates from your substrate.&amp;nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content results in the best pinsets possible.&amp;nbsp; The terrarium works on the principle that air flowing up through the cool perlite absorbs the moisture, bringing it into the air above.&amp;nbsp; Tape up the holes and you defeat the purpose, lowering humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shotgun terrarium theory of operation is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6880451#6880451&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's similar to a system I helped put in during one of my first engineering jobs after school.&amp;nbsp; The system in Alaska is still in operation to this day, keeping the ground around the pipeline frozen all year without using electricity.&amp;nbsp; It works.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11006043</next>\n<prev>10922800</prev>\n<first>10873759</first>\n<last>11006360</last>\n<when>1251083450</when>\n<utime>08/24/09 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
