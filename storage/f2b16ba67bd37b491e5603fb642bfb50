I live in the desert never higher than 30% humidity here. My agar petri dishes dry up&amp;nbsp; in 7-10 days. So both times I've tried I'd get to the 3rd or 4th transfer and forget to transfer and loose my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're supposed to wrap the dishes with parafilm and then place each dish in a ziplock bag.&amp;nbsp; I keep them this way for several months, and it's rarely over 10% humidity here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To isolate strains, you simply make a swipe of spores on agar, and then as the various strains(sectors) emerge, you transfer each one to its own dish.&amp;nbsp; Use these to inoculate cakes or other substrates, and when you find the one you want to keep, go back to the original culture and grow it from then on.&amp;nbsp; Easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Strain-Isolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Strain isolation on agar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16096513</next>\n<prev>16095900</prev>\n<first>16095491</first>\n<last>16097967</last>\n<when>1334572692</when>\n<utime>04/16/12 01:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
