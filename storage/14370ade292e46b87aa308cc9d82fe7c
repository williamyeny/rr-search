However, dunking in the refrigerator is recommended for 24 hours, and is not cold shocking, which involves lowering the temperature for several days to simulate the approach of winter, which is a pinning trigger for temperate species such as shiitake.  The reason for using cooler temperatures during the 24 hour soak is to discourage bacterial growth while the cakes are under water and the mycelium can't fend for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's best to dunk in a large pot of water so the submerged cakes have a bit of pressure on them.  This will force more water into them than they will receive in the jars.  In addition, dunking causes the cakes to expand, so in jars they stop expanding when they hit the glass, thus they stop intaking moisture.  In addition, it pushes the cake tightly against the glass, making birthing harder.  It's best to birth before the dunk so the cakes slide right out of the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week past full colonization, birth the cakes, rinse off the loose part of the verm barrier under running water, and then dunk for 24 hours in cool water.  I use tap water, but that's because the tap water in my location is good.  If you're in doubt, use spring or distilled water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the dunk, rinse well again under the faucet, and then roll the soaking wet cakes in dry vermiculite so that it sticks to the entire surface of the cake.  Once placed into the terrarium, mist several times over the next few hours to hydrate the vermiculite fully so that it serves as a casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6755445</next>\n<prev>6754738</prev>\n<first>6754699</first>\n<last>6755596</last>\n<when>1175900425</when>\n<utime>04/07/07 02:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
