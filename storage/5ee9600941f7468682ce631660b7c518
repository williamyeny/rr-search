Just mulch with some straw or if you're just trying to keep sunlight off, cardboard works too.  I'd be afraid of molds growing under a tarp.   I wouldn't turn it anymore.  Just water it in real well and let it go.  Water once a week or so when it starts to dry out.  You should see fruits within two to three weeks of spawning.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5830792</next>\n<prev>5810249</prev>\n<first>5810249</first>\n<last>5849473</last>\n<when>1151794985</when>\n<utime>07/02/06 02:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
