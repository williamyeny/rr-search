It causes a very rapid swing upward in PH which is fatal to living organisms, which is the purpose of pasteurization.  It's the only lime I use.  You can order it online at <a href=\"http://www.doitbest.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.doitbest.com</a>  When you get to their website, do a search for hydrated lime.<br />I don't recommend chemical pasteurization alone for straw.  Use 1 cup of hydrated lime per ten gallons of 140F to 150F water and pasteurize the straw for one to at most two hours.  Drain and use.  Be sure to soak the straw in warm water for two hours prior to the pasteurization to hydrate it.<br />RR"}}
