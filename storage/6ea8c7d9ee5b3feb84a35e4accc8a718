I use a proved strain on a petri dish, and eberbach it into an LC for inoculations six days later at most.  However, this procedure is out of reach for those without agar skills, a microscope to verify a clean culture, an eberbach autoclavable blender, and a flowhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I hate is the constant advice from noobs to other noobs to inject a spore syringe into karo water and hope for the best.  I've seen many new growers around here give up after a few tries with LC and lose interest in the hobby.  If they had simply followed established procedure, they would have grown mushrooms instead of molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7710070</next>\n<prev>7710036</prev>\n<first>7707789</first>\n<last>7711557</last>\n<when>1196700027</when>\n<utime>12/03/07 06:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
