If however, part of the substrate is contaminated with bacteria for example, it becomes a natural barrier, so when the mycelium reaches it, it's the same as reaching the edges of the substrate and pinning is initiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a case like this, you can either birth and cut off the uncolonized parts, or continue to fruit invitro.  Try turning the jars upside down if you're going to allow them to fruit in the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6180756</prev>\n<first>6180727</first>\n<last>6180814</last>\n<when>1161146616</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 07:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
