This caused them to take in moisture faster than they were able to expand without bursting.<br />If you want to soak your grains, rinse them well in warm tap water to remove the dirt, dust and chaff that make them clump up later if not rinsed away. After rinsing, allow them to soak for a few hours in warm water, or even up to 36 hours, but long soak times are not necessary.<br />Once the grains have soaked and softened, you can then bring them to a boil without ruining them.  Boil until the kernels have doubled in size from what they were when removed from the bag, then drain well until the outside of the kernels are dry.  Load into jars and PC for 90 minutes at 15 PSI.<br />RR"}}
