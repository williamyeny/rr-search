{"key":"post-6706419","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6706419</id>\n<content>We've had variations on this proposal many times in the past, with such things as an &lt;i&gt;intermediate&lt;/i&gt; forum, and one dedicated to &lt;i&gt;pf tek&lt;/i&gt;, etc.  I'm afraid it would make more work for the moderators by having to move posts around, with the resulting complaints that 'the other forum is dead' etc, that I get all the time with moving contamination posts from here to the correct forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great place to post experiments and the results.  The only reason posts get pushed to the back here is the people who refuse to use the search function, thus start a thread for every question they have such as 'should I dunk?', which has been answered thousands of times.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big no-no people seem to do a lot is bump their own posts, which unfairly pushes other peoples posts back.  In fact, I always start on page three or four with the oldest unread post, then work my way back answering questions to page one, so when they bump their own posts, they're actually pushing it to the back of my line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would disagree with another forum, except perhaps one that is exclusively for pf tek, which would cut down on a lot of the traffic here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6706491</next>\n<prev>6706414</prev>\n<first>6705557</first>\n<last>6716056</last>\n<when>1174764395</when>\n<utime>03/24/07 10:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
