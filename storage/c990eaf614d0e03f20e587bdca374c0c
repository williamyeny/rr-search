Wax paper is probably better since the spores don't stick to it. Save the part you tear off for kitchen use. Print the cap and then add a bit of sterilized distilled water to the print and dump it into a sterilized shotglass of distilled water.&amp;nbsp; Then, pull it up into your sterilized syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spores will last longer in a syringe than they will on a print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a sporeprinting and syringe making video tek on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Let's Grow Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; for those who learn better when they can actually see it being performed.&amp;nbsp; It's not on the free clips on my website, but it's on the DVD and download version.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16390470</next>\n<prev>16390434</prev>\n<first>16390434</first>\n<last>16390492</last>\n<when>1339879648</when>\n<utime>06/16/12 11:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
