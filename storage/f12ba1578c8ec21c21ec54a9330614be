Now you can inspect each one, and come back at five minute intervals to take a whiff of each one individually.  When your nose is exposed to a bad stink you become immune to that smell very fast.  That's why it's so hard to find what stinks in the refrigerator even though it nearly knocks you down when you first open the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butterscotch sweet smell is bacteria.
