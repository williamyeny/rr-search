Use the eyeball method.  There's no reason to try an accurate measure because a tad less or too much won't ruin the mix. Disregard the verm when figuring gypsum and lime.  Don't skip on the hydrated lime or calcium carbonate either.  If using calcium carbonate, use ten percent by volume, the same as the gypsum.  If using hydrated lime, a good starting point is a teaspoon per cup of peat.  Shoot for an inital pH of 7.5 to 8.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6790152</next>\n<prev>6790001</prev>\n<first>6789840</first>\n<last>6790152</last>\n<when>1176657930</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 08:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
