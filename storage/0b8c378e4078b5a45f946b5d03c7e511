Walk up and knock on the door and politely ask if you can scoop up some manure for your garden.  I have never, not even once had a private horse owner turn me down.  They're glad to get rid of the stuff, trust me.  If your town has a mounted police department, go to the stables and ask the same thing.  Here, the officer that takes care of the horses even helps shovel it into my bag.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5174086</next>\n<prev>5173782</prev>\n<first>5173741</first>\n<last>5174547</last>\n<when>1137121646</when>\n<utime>01/13/06 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
