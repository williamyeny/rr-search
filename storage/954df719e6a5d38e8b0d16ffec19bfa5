No verm, no brf, and they performed pretty good, but not as well as plain brf/verm.  It's not about pH because mushroom mycelium actually likes an acidic pH.  However, Brown rice flour has a bit more 'food' than coffee grinds, so I'd stick with the basic recipe if you're using cakes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7361425</next>\n<prev>7360899</prev>\n<first>7360265</first>\n<last>7363821</last>\n<when>1188741887</when>\n<utime>09/02/07 05:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
