If your understanding of the 'structure of steel' means you think pressure vessels are made from mild steel, a bit of study is in order, because <b>pressure vessel steel is tempered</b>. I fail to understand how in the age of the internet people have become so lazy that they'll talk trash without so much as taking 20 seconds to do a simple search. This is the second time this afternoon I've had to rip a head off for spewing bullshit without having an understanding of the basic facts. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ASTM_International_standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">The ATSM has produced many standards</a>, including for pressure vessel steel, and requirements for welding the same, for which I'm a certified welder.<br />Any pressure vessel which has been ran dry is toast, period. End of story.&nbsp; Anyone who uses one after overheating is a candidate for the Darwin Award. <br />In addition, one shouldn't assume it's steel.&nbsp; Many pressure cookers are forged aluminum, including the top of the line All American.&nbsp; The factory won't even repair units which have been ran dry.&nbsp; They're disposed of, just as are pressure vessels which have been shock cooled, both of which destroy the integrity of the metal.<br />RR"}}
