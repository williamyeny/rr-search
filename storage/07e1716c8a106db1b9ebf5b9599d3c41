And, wouldn't it take a while for the mycelium to dig into the chunk, because it's not quite a airy as the ground up stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mycelium rips around and through the chunks.&amp;nbsp; Remember, mycelium is only one cell in thickness.&amp;nbsp; The chunky coir is full of passageways and tunnels, etc., that are far larger than one cell width in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend pasteurization of coir.&amp;nbsp; I've said in the past that it 'can' be used without pasteurization, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. I mostly mention unpasteurized coir when someone is trying to find the cause of their green mold.&amp;nbsp; Generally, it's due to contaminated spawn, since fungi spores have a very hard time germinating on coir for reasons that remain unknown.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11646056</next>\n<prev>11645894</prev>\n<first>11641424</first>\n<last>11646179</last>\n<when>1260767688</when>\n<utime>12/14/09 07:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
