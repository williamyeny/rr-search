So much for the incubation temperature discussions at &quot;other&quot; shroom-oriented message boards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's due to an incorrect figure of 86F being listed as optimal in one of Stamets books.&amp;nbsp; They're simply parroting that figure and live with high failure rates, blaming other things. We've known for a long time that 86F figure was bunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss out the contaminated bags and start over.&amp;nbsp; To answer your question, sterilization is never complete, regardless of what you read elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; It would take 24 hours to completely sterilize a bag of rye berries, and they'd be a useless mash of slimy material after that long.&amp;nbsp; The one to two hour sterilization we give is a window of opportunity to get the grains colonized before contamination sets in.&amp;nbsp; The bacterial endospores are not all killed during a two hour cycle.&amp;nbsp; When you 'incubate' you stimulate them to germinate, while slowing down the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the bacteria wins.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10638330</next>\n<prev>10637279</prev>\n<first>10635321</first>\n<last>10738753</last>\n<when>1247019602</when>\n<utime>07/08/09 05:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
