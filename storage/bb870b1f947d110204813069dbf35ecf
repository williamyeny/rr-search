{"key":"post-5764173","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5764173</id>\n<content>I made up a dozen or so slides just using distilled water.  I noticed the trikaryotic phenomona on all of them, but only about one in ten cells or so.  I see no pattern to the three nuclei vs the normal dikaryotic cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps workman will see this and give his input.  I know this isn't the first time it's happened, because I've seen it before, but not with this degree of regularity.  I'm curious if his pf albino shows the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5764182</next>\n<prev>5764046</prev>\n<first>5761471</first>\n<last>5791920</last>\n<when>1150654442</when>\n<utime>06/18/06 09:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
