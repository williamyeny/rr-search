Your breath leaving your mouth is traveling faster even than a flow hood can blow it back.  It's also perhaps the largest source of bacteria in our jars.  The bests surgical masks will stop 99% of the bacteria leaving your mouth, but think about that 1% of several billion that gets through.  That's a lot of bacteria even with a good medical, not dust mask.  I hold my breath anytime a jar or petri dish is open.  Gloves are mandatory for consistent success.  A box of them is less than the price of a single spore syringe.  They'll save a lot of failures.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5368869</next>\n<prev>5368660</prev>\n<first>5368509</first>\n<last>6390617</last>\n<when>1141622004</when>\n<utime>03/06/06 07:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
