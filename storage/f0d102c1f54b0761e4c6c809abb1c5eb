Allow the water to overflow and run gently down the drain overnight.  The running water will prevent bacteria buildup during the dunk.  Put a rock or some other weight on the substrate to keep it submerged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5344447</next>\n<prev>5344206</prev>\n<first>5344192</first>\n<last>5344447</last>\n<when>1141052621</when>\n<utime>02/27/06 05:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
