{"key":"post-6778772","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6778772</id>\n<content>If you mist small pins/primorida, then don't properly dry them out immediately, they'll abort.  You need to raise air exchange drastically after misting for that purpose.  Leave the lid off the terrarium until the pins dry off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High CO2 levels are another thing that causes pins to abort.  Mycelium can form primordia in conditions that can't sustain a flush, so lots of air exchange is very important throughout the fruiting process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If those aren't the causes, weak genetics sometimes will produce flushes that abort.  In that case, just isolate good fruiting strains or roll the dice again with multispore.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6778794</next>\n<prev>6778763</prev>\n<first>6778723</first>\n<last>6779167</last>\n<when>1176402061</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 09:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
