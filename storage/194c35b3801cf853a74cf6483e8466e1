It works fine, but I still can't get 4 flushes.  I wash the entire casing off under the sink, then apply new casing each flush.  In my area, it's the only way to get three flushes...lol&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4173749</next>\n<prev>4172580</prev>\n<first>4172200</first>\n<last>4174007</last>\n<when>1116037169</when>\n<utime>05/14/05 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
