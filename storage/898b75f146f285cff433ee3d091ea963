You need to move that light away and stop using it for heat.  64F in the period of darkness is just fine.  Get a $6 fluorescent 'under counter' type light at the hardware store and run it for 12 hours per day.  Incandescent light bulbs are the wrong color temperature to stimulate a good pinset, and they produce too much heat as well.<br />You don't need two air exchanges per day.  You want several per HOUR.  Leave the lid loose, and/or drill holes in your tub to provide constant air exchange and circulation.  Put in enough damp perlite to make up for the lost moisture.<br />RR"}}
