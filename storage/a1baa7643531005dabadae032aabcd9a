I opened a 500mg cap of amoxicillin in 500ml of water and have been using that for my grain LC water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, you want to use an autoclavable antibiotic so you can add it without taking a chance on letting anything nasty in.&amp;nbsp; The antibiotic is useless against mold, only bacteria.&amp;nbsp; It also tends to only mask or slow down the infection, not cure or eliminate it, therefore you may still have it when you spawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place for antibiotics is on a petri dish where you can transfer the mycelium a few times on regular media after the antibiotics to ensure you actually have a clean culture before using it for inoculation of grains.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Gentamicin sulfate&lt;/i&gt; is usually used.&amp;nbsp; I don't have time right now to verify the spelling so I probably screwed it up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19552442</next>\n<prev>19551589</prev>\n<first>19464151</first>\n<last>19552445</last>\n<when>1392136667</when>\n<utime>02/11/14 06:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
