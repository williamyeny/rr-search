However, everyone from me to the reputable vendors to paul stamets has found that fewer spores are much better.  Think about it:  The more spores scraped off a print, the more natural contaminants are also scraped off.  Since mold grows far faster than mushroom mycelium, it's self-defeating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest setting those jars aside, and ordering from a reputable vendor before you start any more projects.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8436209</next>\n<prev>8436170</prev>\n<first>8433626</first>\n<last>8436209</last>\n<when>1211553166</when>\n<utime>05/23/08 05:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
