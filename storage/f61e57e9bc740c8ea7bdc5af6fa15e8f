(More on that gizmodery some other time) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan kicking out is a concern but the humidifier provides fresh air also, with or without a fogger, air comes in through a fishtank pump (that's what the blue tubing connects to btw) arguably in my next version I could justify getting rid of the fan all together...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to a time when I'll have a job that has me home every day so that I can just set up a tub with polyfill and call it a day.&amp;nbsp;  Until then, this has been working nicely with my schedule! &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:smile:&quot; title=&quot;:smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you could build a shotgun terrarium, leave for three days and come home to everything just fine with no fire hazard and nothing to break down.&amp;nbsp; I hold degrees in both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, and what did I design?&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;, not because it's complicated, but because it works better than any 'automated' system my 40 years of experience in industrial automation and controls could ever put together.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15847146</next>\n<prev>15844445</prev>\n<first>15842517</first>\n<last>19981348</last>\n<when>1329880029</when>\n<utime>02/22/12 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
