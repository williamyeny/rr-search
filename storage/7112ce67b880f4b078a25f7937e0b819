Set small blocks or pieces of pvc on the perlite to hold the trays elevated.  You could also build a wire rack for the trays to sit on.  However, keep up plenty of air exchange even with the holes, as normally the substrate trays evaporate enough to maintain pretty good humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7686602</next>\n<prev>7685738</prev>\n<first>7685670</first>\n<last>7686602</last>\n<when>1196195235</when>\n<utime>11/27/07 10:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
