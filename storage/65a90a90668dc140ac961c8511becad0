I've heard one should have a 24 hour harvest window, but if I were to do that, I'd harvest a shit load of immature pins. What to do..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for the trusted cultivator tag before you listen to bad information like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term 'flush' was invented by humans to describe what they wish would happen.&amp;nbsp; The reality is the mushrooms fruit when and where they're ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harvest mushrooms by slicing at the base so you don't damage the substrate, which we've been suggesting here for at least the decade I've been around.&amp;nbsp; Harvest as they're ready.&amp;nbsp; Never try to pick them all within 24 hours or you remove all the pins that are just waiting their time to grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19916713</next>\n<prev>19915767</prev>\n<first>19915098</first>\n<last>19916713</last>\n<when>1398782484</when>\n<utime>04/29/14 05:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
