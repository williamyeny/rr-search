If there's any healthy mycelium, transfer a tiny piece of that from the leading edge of growth.  A few days later, transfer again before any molds have had a chance to show up.  Repeat a few times and you'll have a clean culture, provided there is any mushroom mycelium on the plate.  It should also go with out saying to use a glovebox.  Never open a contaminated petri dish in front of a flow hood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6839914</next>\n<prev>6838785</prev>\n<first>6838785</first>\n<last>6839914</last>\n<when>1177649004</when>\n<utime>04/27/07 07:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
