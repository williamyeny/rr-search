If you can find a clean plate or something similar to keep a bit of pressure on the straw it will help, but don't stress over it on this grow.  Just remember on future grows, it's best to have straw compressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, this is only for straw.  Manure or coir substrates should never be packed down tight because they are much denser than straw to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6282715</next>\n<prev>6282429</prev>\n<first>6255551</first>\n<last>6282715</last>\n<when>1163538301</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 11:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
