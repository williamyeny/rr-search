If you're using ground limestone, you'll probably want a bit more than that.  If you use hydrated lime, a bit less.  With hydrated lime, I figure one teaspoon per cup of dry peat, and that gets it really close.  It's hard to measure PH as you go because it needs a couple of hours to settle down to get a good reading, and you really need to mix the lime with the dry peat to get it mixed in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix the dry ingredients except the verm together before wetting.  Moisten the peat/lime/oyster shells/gypsum in one bowl and the verm in another, then mix together.  Adjust to field capacity and pasteurize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5991541</prev>\n<first>5991539</first>\n<last>5991757</last>\n<when>1156417093</when>\n<utime>08/24/06 01:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
