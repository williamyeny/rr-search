If you wait until the mycelium is all over the top of the casing, then what is the use of the casing??  I rarely see mycelium on top of the casings.  The pins form below, and pop right on up.  The casing layer provides a moist, humid micro environment, that will induce pinning.  If it's completely colonized by the myc, it can't do its job. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1497474</next>\n<prev>1497284</prev>\n<first>1496200</first>\n<last>1497722</last>\n<when>1051438694</when>\n<utime>04/27/03 01:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
