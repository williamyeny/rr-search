The weight needs to be light enough to allow the bags to vent steam, but not uncurl totally.&amp;nbsp; Also, I only sterilize at 1 psi, but for 8 hours.&amp;nbsp; Even at 1 psi, when I shut down the boiler I have to be very careful to open the vent on the homemade autoclaves just as zero pressure is reached.&amp;nbsp; If the autoclave is allowed to pull a vacuum right away, it will burst or at least unfold your bags in order to vent the steam that is still under pressure inside the bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't use those type bags anymore due to the high failure rate with the filters, but be aware that most poly bags will get brittle at any temperature over 120C, which is around 15 psi.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't try to run higher than that, and I've actually had better success using less pressure for a longer duration.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17132283</next>\n<prev>17118506</prev>\n<first>17102419</first>\n<last>17132283</last>\n<when>1351488459</when>\n<utime>10/29/12 08:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
