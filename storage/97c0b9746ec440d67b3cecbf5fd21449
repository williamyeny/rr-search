To answer the question accurately, it's important to know what is INside the jars.  Procedures are far different for grains than for brf cakes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For brf cakes, you can open the lid without fear if you have a vermiculite filter.  I would recommend against turning them upside down because it disturbs the filter, and all the contaminants on the top surface of the verm filter can be mixed into the uncolonized substrate below.  CO2 doesn't 'drain' out when they're upside down anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7757959</next>\n<prev>7757118</prev>\n<first>7756124</first>\n<last>7780789</last>\n<when>1197648138</when>\n<utime>12/14/07 06:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
