{"key":"post-7232983","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7232983</id>\n<content>It's the reason I suggest tossing any project discovered with mold the very second it's discovered.  Often, a project can 'recover' enough to fruit anyway, but it dooms future projects by releasing billions, even trillions of contaminant spores into your house.  That's what is happening to you now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the contaminant spore load in your house is very high.  The mold spores stick to the walls, ceiling, carpet, you, your dog/cat, etc., and then break off in the slightest breeze to become airborne, thus contaminating future projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have to pay special attention to sterile procedure from now on. I'd bleach bomb the whole house, spraying until wet, the walls, ceiling and carpet(hopefully, it's light colored).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your latest project probably got contaminated at inoculation due to the high sporeload. It can be overcome though with proper procedure.  I live in a small condo in a large city, and have wall to wall carpeting. Trust me, I've had more than one mold outbreak, but still grow.  Your place is usable, but you'll have to follow extreme sterile procedure from now on. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7233000</next>\n<prev>7232950</prev>\n<first>7232950</first>\n<last>7235796</last>\n<when>1185629638</when>\n<utime>07/28/07 04:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
