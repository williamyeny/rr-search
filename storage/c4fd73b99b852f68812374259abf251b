And then they'd write a 'tek'. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:frown:&quot; title=&quot;:frown:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years later, we know that fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger specifically BECAUSE it causes a drying in the terrarium, thus a loss of moisture from the substrate.&amp;nbsp; This moisture is replaced at intervals during the day, and this results in much greater performance than we got in the 'old days'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a larger terrarium.&amp;nbsp; Get rid of that little thing that will cause the air to become stale too fast, and look for one that is at least 16&quot; tall. Use 4 to 5 inches of well drained perlite and lots of holes per the shotgun terrarium tek on my website.&amp;nbsp; Mist as required, but at least three to five times per day, including just before you leave for work and just after you return.&amp;nbsp; Fan after misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10238006</next>\n<prev>10237585</prev>\n<first>10237158</first>\n<last>10243062</last>\n<when>1240787971</when>\n<utime>04/27/09 02:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
