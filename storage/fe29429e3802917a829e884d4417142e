{"key":"post-6003510","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6003510</id>\n<content>Substrains generally combine into a single organism through the process of anastomosis prior to fruiting.  Sometimes, a couple of the strains are not compatible and that's when you see a flush with mostly one type of mushroom, but a small area where they look totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep making LC's from the previous LC, you'll run into the same loss of vigor problems one sees from doing too many grain to grain transfers.  Any given cell line can only expand so many times.  After that, it stops growing and just sits there, or colonizes and fruits poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to isolate individual strains to find the superstrain, you'll have to learn agar work.  You can see each individual strain on a petri dish.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6003860</next>\n<prev>6003334</prev>\n<first>6003250</first>\n<last>10165365</last>\n<when>1156741917</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 08:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
