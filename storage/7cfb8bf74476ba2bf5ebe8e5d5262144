How long did it take a mod to see this?<br />Listen expert, we try very hard to <b>moderate</b> threads here, not police or shut them down.  If I have to shut it down, I will.  I also try hard to fix what's broken before bringing down the ban hammer.  Usually a pm to an offending person will set things straight.  Other times not, but the staff is here and watching.  If we leave it up, we get bitched at for being PART-TIME, if we shut it down, ten other people would bitch that we're censoring information.  What gives?<br />RR"}}
