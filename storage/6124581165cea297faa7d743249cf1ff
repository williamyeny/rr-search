Everybody else who said it's a waste or they'll fight it out is just making shit up.  I've posted on this dozens of times and am tired of typing it over and over again endlessly because people don't want to search.  Hyphae from the same species such as cubensis will readily mix just the same as spores from the same darn print will mate.  In fact, I just answered this question in detail in the last few days.<br />RR"}}
