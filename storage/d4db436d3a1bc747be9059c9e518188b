Therefore, if you heat the contents of your jars to 250F without pressure, the simple fact is the grains will be drier than they were when you removed them from the bag you purchased them in.  All the moisture will have evaporated off, leaving the grains totally dry and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 5000' elevation, simply add 1/3 extra time to your pressure cooking cycle and continue to use 15 psi.  In other words, instead of cooking for two hours, use three hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5953678</next>\n<prev>5953421</prev>\n<first>5951830</first>\n<last>5955778</last>\n<when>1155317642</when>\n<utime>08/11/06 08:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
