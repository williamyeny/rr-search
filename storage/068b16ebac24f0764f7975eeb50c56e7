I still use them after hundreds, if not thousands of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next would be to get polyfill from a department store.  It's the white fiber used to fill stuffed animals.  You drill a 3/8&quot; (.5mm) hole in the lid and stuff it with the polyfill, which acts as a filter.  You can also inject spores or liquid mycelium cultures right through the polyfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have tyvek, filter disks, or polyfill, the old standard for years was to stuff a normal cotton ball into the hole in the lid, just as we now use polyfill.  The cotton serves as a filter too, but bear in mind, cotton is organic so must be kept totally dry at all times or contaminats will easily colonize right through it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6455408</next>\n<prev>6455318</prev>\n<first>6455318</first>\n<last>6455492</last>\n<when>1168715877</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 09:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
