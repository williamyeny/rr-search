If you heat beyond 170f, you're partially sterilizing and you'll have the same problems PC'ing will cause.  A few minutes in the microwave will easily exceed that temperature, killing off beneficial bacteria that will help your substrate resist attack by harmful thermophilic bacteria and molds.  I pasteurize in quart jars after first mixing the ingredients and bringing to field moisture capacity.
