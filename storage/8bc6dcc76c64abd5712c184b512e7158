You really need to get a few grows under your belt and not try to simply paraphrase what you've read in other threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT pick all the small pins when you harvest first flush.  If you do you destroy the second and third flushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunking substrates is an excellent way to hydrate between flushes.  Recase the divits where the substrate was damaged by picking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of pins that develop in the second flush has nothing at all to do with the first flush, unless you do something silly like pick them off.  Many times, as said above, the pins for the first three flushes all form at once, then sit dormant waiting their turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first flush is over when you've picked the mature fruits.  The second flush will begin when the pins you LEAVE in place begin to grow a few days after you pick.  Dunking won't hurt the pins.  Just make sure you give plenty of air exchange when you place the tray back in the fruiting chamber, so the water can evaporate off the pins.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5639324</next>\n<prev>5639195</prev>\n<first>5635532</first>\n<last>13069744</last>\n<when>1147832899</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 05:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
