Case it.   It's ok to add the casing anytime after about 90% colonization, imo.  Some growers even apply the casing material at the time they prepare and spawn the bulk substrate, but I feel it's best to wait.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6562522</next>\n<prev>6562267</prev>\n<first>6562217</first>\n<last>6563608</last>\n<when>1171385597</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 06:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
