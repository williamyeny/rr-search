When I get back it would have been soaking for about 96 hours. I'm going to attempt to fruit it and see if there's any success.. Anyone ever had anything like this happen before? Any chance it will still produce viable fruits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a semi-literate member several years ago who read &lt;i&gt;24 hour dunk&lt;/i&gt; as 24 day dunk.&amp;nbsp; Amazingly, his cakes survived and fruited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may as well toss that cake.&amp;nbsp; After spores drop like that they won't flush again, or if they do, you'll only get one or two fruits and it's likely to get moldy in the process.&amp;nbsp; I'd bury it in a garden area with some manure mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16390043</next>\n<prev>16381248</prev>\n<first>16267702</first>\n<last>16455056</last>\n<when>1339707603</when>\n<utime>06/15/12 12:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
