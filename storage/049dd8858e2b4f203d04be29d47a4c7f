It's an improper use of the term and confusing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Casing' is just the layer you put on top of your substrate.  Any mushroom substrate needs near 100% humidity in order to form primordia.  The casing layer provides a humid microclimate by being loosely layed on top of the substrate, thus providing 100% humidity on the surface of the substrate where primordia form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since cakes, and when you get into edibles, substrate blocks don't have that casing layer, you need to provide 100% humidity by using a misting fog, or a terrarium kept at very high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6162711</prev>\n<first>6162351</first>\n<last>6163202</last>\n<when>1160698679</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 03:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
