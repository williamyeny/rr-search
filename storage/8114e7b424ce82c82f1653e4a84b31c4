So show us your mad search engine skills and provide a link that clearly explains how you can breed dominate traits into a print instead of repeating the erroneous fact that in all cases a spore print resets genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's apparent that your mind is made up by use of the word 'erroneous'.&amp;nbsp; However, it's not erroneous, but fact.&amp;nbsp; When there's millions of spores on a print and each one has its own genetic code, the mathematics of any two of those millions carrying the trait you're after is far from the ideal method. This means any of us would probably die of old age before perfecting a 'strain' this way and is why experienced growers perform thousands of strain isolations and do their genetic work with isolated dikaryotic strains, not spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I didn't take offense to your comment.&amp;nbsp; Questioning procedures is how we learn.&amp;nbsp; However, I'm not going to go into detail on an imperfect method when there's far more effective ones.&amp;nbsp; It would be like going to an online car forum and demanding an experienced mechanic detail exactly how you'd design a car with square wheels, simply because that's what you've made up your mind you want to do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15823440</next>\n<prev>15823316</prev>\n<first>15817072</first>\n<last>15823651</last>\n<when>1329510311</when>\n<utime>02/17/12 10:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
