They only need to go snug, then 1/8 turn.  That will be far from as tight as you can make it.  Also, make sure you always put a tiny smear of vaseline around the sealing surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6626649</next>\n<prev>6626638</prev>\n<first>6626622</first>\n<last>6626653</last>\n<when>1172818646</when>\n<utime>03/02/07 08:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
