There's no such thing as too much humidity.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms thrive in 100% humidity, so I want to scream when I read that nonesense.&amp;nbsp; What is going to happen is someone will search 'fuzz on stems' and threads like this will come up, and they'll think they have too much humidity, and do something dumb like reduce it.&amp;nbsp; I've typed this at least a hundred times, but still it gets repeated. :angry:&amp;nbsp; I can't catch every thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuzz on the base of the stems is just that. . .It is not a sign of anything.&amp;nbsp; It's mycelium, and it's normal.
