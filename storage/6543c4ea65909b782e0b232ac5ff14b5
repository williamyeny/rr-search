Often, they don't mix and you see different areas of differing fruit body shapes.  Othertimes, they 'mix' and what you get is a cross between the strains.  It's not a hybrid, as the species is the same.  I've never had it cause problems.  I've seen some excellent flushes come from mixing strains.  After all, it's what happens everytime you use multispore inoculation.<br />RR"}}
