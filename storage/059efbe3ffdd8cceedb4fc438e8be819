They really needed to be washed well before the soak period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grogan, a single 1/4&quot; hole stuffed with polyfill isn't enough.  In addition, some growers stuff too much polyfill into the hole, further reducing gas exchange.  You only need enough to keep it from falling back out.  If you make the polyfill tight in the hole, air/gas can't make it through.  Consider a 3/8&quot; hole the minimum size, with 1/2&quot; even better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6289292</next>\n<prev>6288141</prev>\n<first>6287684</first>\n<last>6290874</last>\n<when>1163660779</when>\n<utime>11/16/06 09:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
