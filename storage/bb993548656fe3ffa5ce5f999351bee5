In that case the air is more dense than the air outside the chamber and moves out...the holes. Air with a higher relative humidity and therefor weight defies gravity and moves up? Ever take physics? The Earth orbits the sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, lots of us around here have taken physics, so we know that humid air is LESS dense than dry air.&amp;nbsp; That's why clouds usually float above us.&amp;nbsp; The heaviest air is when a cold wind brings an arctic cold front.&amp;nbsp; They're usually right on the surface, and if you go up a few hundred feet, it can be ten to fifteen degrees warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dense air pushes on less dense air.&amp;nbsp; This is how an airplane wing works.&amp;nbsp; The air passing over the curved surface on the top of the wing has farther to travel, thus the molecules spread out and the air becomes less dense.&amp;nbsp; The air flowing under the relatively flat surface of the bottom of the wing has less distance to travel, thus the molecules are closer together.&amp;nbsp; This results in lift, with the bottom of the wing supporting the entire weight of the aircraft, provided it keeps its speed up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12560617</next>\n<prev>12559051</prev>\n<first>12552953</first>\n<last>12561505</last>\n<when>1273813041</when>\n<utime>05/14/10 07:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
