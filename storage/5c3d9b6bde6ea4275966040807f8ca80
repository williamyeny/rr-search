Don't dunk in coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use your spent coffee grinds mixed in with the straw if you want a boost, but using liquid coffee is much more likely to encourage mold than mushroom mycelium.  When using liquid coffee, it must be kept in sterile conditions until fully colonized.  That's why I only recommend using coffee to hydrate grains, which are then sterilized and colonized in a sealed, filtered jar.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you doubt this, just leave a cup of coffee sitting out on the counter for a few days.  It's sure to grow a spot of mold on top.  Since it can take up to two weeks to colonize a straw project, liquid coffee is too dangerous to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6586831</next>\n<prev>6580578</prev>\n<first>6580414</first>\n<last>6586831</last>\n<when>1171818423</when>\n<utime>02/18/07 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
