The temperature inside the center of the substrate in a jar is still not much over room temperature when the water surrounding it begins to boil.  That's why we bring the water to a full boil when our substrate or casing material is being heat treated in jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sealed jars do not explode in a pressure cooker unless somebody does something dumb like release pressure at the end of the cycle instead of letting the unit cool slowly and naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A kettle of boiling water will not exceed 212F/100C, thus no steam pressure is developed within the jar.  There may be a bit of air pressure as the contents expand, but not nearly enough to ruin the jars.  I've used the above described method thousands of times, so this isn't a theory, it's fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7544697</next>\n<prev>7534533</prev>\n<first>7531143</first>\n<last>7544697</last>\n<when>1192806168</when>\n<utime>10/19/07 06:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
