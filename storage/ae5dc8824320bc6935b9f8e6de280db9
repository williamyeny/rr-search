Take a series of transfers of pieces of mycelium from the leading edge of the circle of growth and transfer to new plates.  As these start to grow out, you'll probably see some sectoring.  Transfer each sector to a new dish, and continue until you have single sector isolates, and then fruit each one to find a few stellar performers.  Be sure to keep them properly labeled so when you fruit out a great one, you can go back to the original petri dish that you've stored in the refrigerator, to get an earlier version of it to propagate and store in a culture slant.<br />RR"}}
