This is an ongoing discussion that's been repeated for many years.  Everybody I know from several years ago that pushed the very dark syringes, now uses very light ones, so that says something.  Personally, I haven't injected a jar with a spore syringe in many years.  In fact, the last time I did was with one of pf's first ones he shipped out in the mid 90's.  I always isolate on agar, then make master slants with the best performers, and those last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6689653</next>\n<prev>6688123</prev>\n<first>6687511</first>\n<last>6691521</last>\n<when>1174364345</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 07:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
