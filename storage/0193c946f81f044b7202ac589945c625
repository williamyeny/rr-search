Clean it very well first, then spray with oust to knock back airborn bacteria.  Flame sterilize your needle between each jar.  There is no real need to let the needle cool down because the first few drops will do that, allowing the rest to flow contamiant free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the vent fan off, and perhaps even lay a towel down by the gap under the door.
