Manure should be field aged for at least three months, and even longer in the winter.  By breaking open a nugget or two, you can tell if it's ready.  It should be dry(unless it's raining that day) and zero smell other than a bit of earth/straw should come from it.  If it smells like fresh manure or ammonia, look for older kernels to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6234284</next>\n<prev>6233355</prev>\n<first>6233207</first>\n<last>6234284</last>\n<when>1162396204</when>\n<utime>11/01/06 05:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
