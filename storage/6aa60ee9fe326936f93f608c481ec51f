{"key":"post-4775333","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4775333</id>\n<content>After applying the casing layer, I like to cover with aluminum foil for a few days to let the casing begin to colonize.  Personally, I don't wait for the mycelium to show through the top.  Three days, then the foil comes off and expose to fruiting conditions.  I also incubate on a shelf at normal room temperature so there is never any temperature drop.  Cubensis is a warm weather species and many experiments have shown me no benefit to any sort of temperature drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't want fruits forming on the bottom of your substrate, you'll have to find a way to prevent light being reflected up from the perlite below.  Tape, paint, or a colored container are all options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruits forming invitro on the bottom will be just fine waiting until the flush on top is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's probably best to leave the colonized parts of the old casing layer on during the dunk, but you can wash any loose casing off under the faucet.  After the dunk, rinse the entire block again under the faucet to remove any bacteria that may have built up during the dunk.  A good way to dunk large substrates is to leave them in the container you fruit in, but weight them down with a jar or two of water on the top.  Place them in the kitchen sink and let the faucet run slowly all night with the drain open.  Let it fill up the tray and spill over the sides.  The running water really seems to work great at keeping contaminants from getting a foothold during the dunk.  After the dunk, apply fresh casing material to the low spots and any exposed substrate.  Also fill in the gaps around the sides with fresh casing material, because as the mycelium feeds the substrate will naturally shrink and pull away from the edges of the container.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4775565</next>\n<prev>4774868</prev>\n<first>4774688</first>\n<last>4775565</last>\n<when>1128839118</when>\n<utime>10/09/05 09:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
