{"key":"post-6805303","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6805303</id>\n<content>I've scanned my crops and colonizing jars and substrate bags with an IR camera and noticed up to five degree F increase in quart jars of rye, and up to a 15F degree increase over ambient when shooting at large gusseted spawn bags, but that was 15F over ambient at the edge of the bag.  I'm sure the center was hotter.  I usually have up to 200 spawn bags colonizing at any given time on shelves in my grow room, and I never heat it, even in the coldest months of winter.  The temperature in the room rarely drops below 75F, even when it's freezing outdoors.  We use minimal heat in the rest of the condo as well, simply leaving the growroom door open is enough to supply most of the heat we use.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't turned the central heating system on since I moved into this place.  In fact, if I wasn't planning to sell the darn thing soon, I'd rob the blower off the unit to build a bigger flowhood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6805789</next>\n<prev>6805239</prev>\n<first>6805239</first>\n<last>6806949</last>\n<when>1176937985</when>\n<utime>04/19/07 02:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
