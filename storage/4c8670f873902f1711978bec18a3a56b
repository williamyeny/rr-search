If the mycelium is starving, it will search for food.  Since the vermiculite is inert, it won't find it.  We see the same thing when people use popcorn for spawn.  The jars colonize twice as fast as rye, but have only half or less as much mycelium per jar.  There is no advantage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6131750</next>\n<prev>6131245</prev>\n<first>6131044</first>\n<last>6148367</last>\n<when>1159976440</when>\n<utime>10/04/06 06:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
