It looks like you got a really good pinset from a small substrate.  There's only so much energy available, so lots of pins equals small fruits.  If you had only had a few mushrooms form, they would be much larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off topic, but I'd suggest avoiding aluminum foil under your substrate.  The mycelium will 'consume' the foil as you will see when you remove it.  The foil will be full of holes that the mycelium has eaten.  Metals absorbed by the mycelium will end up in fruitbodies, and aluminum has been implicated in alzhimers and other conditions.  Just use a dark tray to avoid pinning on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5337666</next>\n<prev>5337641</prev>\n<first>5337635</first>\n<last>5338077</last>\n<when>1140891200</when>\n<utime>02/25/06 08:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
