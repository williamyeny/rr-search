It's an RR original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk tray should not be opened up during colonization to take pictures.  That will cause early pinning from the reduction in CO2 levels, not light.  You need to keep it closed up with gas exchange, but no massive amounts of air exchange such as happens with opening it all the way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't see any pins on the cakes yet, but shouldn't be long.  What you're seeing there is aerial mycelium.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've dunked for 36 hours before.  I would think it would get a bit more moisture inside the cake than 12.  Perhaps after first flush you can give it a longer dunk.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6937013</next>\n<prev>6935082</prev>\n<first>6932424</first>\n<last>6949346</last>\n<when>1179555311</when>\n<utime>05/19/07 09:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
