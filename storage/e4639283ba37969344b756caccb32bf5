Don't wait for the bacteria or molds to show up.  In isolating outdoor strains, I often make transfers two to three days apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final cleanup, I'll pour hot antibiotic agar over the growth in a petri dish, completely covering it.  The hot agar 'pasteurizes' the bacteria, shocking it, but the mycelium recovers and grows up through the second layer, appearing on top in a couple of days.   Shave a bit of this new mycelium off the top and place in a new dish.  If necessary, repeat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6084475</next>\n<prev>6083506</prev>\n<first>6083506</first>\n<last>6090246</last>\n<when>1158800059</when>\n<utime>09/21/06 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
