As long as the sides are clear, you're good to go.  More light equals better pinsets, but don't let your tubs dry out.  I've found that giving an hour or so per day in front of a window with the sun shining gives crazy pinsets.  These oysters on pf cakes received an hour or two of direct sun from a west window.  This picture, believe it or not is on the third day after birthing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of air exchange is important, so be sure to cut a bunch of holes in the terrarium.  Notice all the holes drilled into mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the laws of physics are running against them. There is no way a pf cake can continue to support a massive flush like this.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-005/054567909-pf_oysters_001a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-005/054567909-thumb_pf_oysters_001a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-005/054567916-pf_oysters_006a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-005/054567916-thumb_pf_oysters_006a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6527109</next>\n<prev>6526682</prev>\n<first>6526542</first>\n<last>6532456</last>\n<when>1170545808</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 01:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
