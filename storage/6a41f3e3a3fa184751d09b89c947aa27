Perlite is inert, so doesn't contaminate anyway, and water that evaporates is by definition, distilled water.  In other words, minerals and salts don't evaporate with the water-they're left behind.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7654764</next>\n<prev>7654717</prev>\n<first>7606011</first>\n<last>7662244</last>\n<when>1195504056</when>\n<utime>11/19/07 10:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
