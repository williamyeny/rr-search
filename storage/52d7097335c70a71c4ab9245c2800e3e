Make it as large as you need for the job.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't want your shelves much higher than face level or you'll need a stool or ladder to check the projects on top.&amp;nbsp; It does help to have that room up there for the cool mist to fire into though.&amp;nbsp; The top 2 1/2 feet of my greenhouse is empty space.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8881352</next>\n<prev>8880117</prev>\n<first>8879267</first>\n<last>8882403</last>\n<when>1220594051</when>\n<utime>09/05/08 08:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
