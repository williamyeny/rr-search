If you SEARCH for horse manure teks, you'll find you should only pick up manure from the field that has been field aged by the sun and leached by the rain.  You should't be picking up anything less than several months old.  NEVER collect fresh manure.  It's worthless.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7583674</next>\n<prev>7583664</prev>\n<first>7583442</first>\n<last>7584309</last>\n<when>1193937689</when>\n<utime>11/01/07 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
