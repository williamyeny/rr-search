{"key":"post-9716242","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>9716242</id>\n<content>For an outdoor bed, mixed wood is great.&amp;nbsp; You should be able to call the local tree trimming outfit in your town and get all you need already shredded and dumped on your driveway for free.&amp;nbsp; They get it when they trim trees away from power lines, along roads, or when they clean up storm damaged trees. Hardwood is best, but it's OK if Douglas fir is mixed in. I doubt you'll find Douglas fir much beyond the west coast of the US.&amp;nbsp; Don't use pine.&amp;nbsp; In the PNW, most landscapers get chipped wood as described above, and that's where the cyans will be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For expanding your spawn to inoculate the outdoor beds, you'll want sterilized hardwood chips/sawdust so try to find Oak, Alder, Birch, Apple, etc., that is available in your area. Don't use pine. Inoculate it with grain spawn. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9720127</next>\n<prev>9716134</prev>\n<first>9712425</first>\n<last>9720127</last>\n<when>1233504009</when>\n<utime>02/01/09 06:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
