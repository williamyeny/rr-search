In fact, the bacteria in the manure would contaminate the grains, endospores or not. Don't mix uncolonized grains and manure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would see no benefit to mixing grains and manure and sterilizing both togheter.  Grains are much more nutritious than manure, so the manure would be diluting your grain.  Best to let the grains colonize fully, then spawn them to five to ten times the amount of pasteurized manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5171146</next>\n<prev>5170596</prev>\n<first>5166877</first>\n<last>5246167</last>\n<when>1137070405</when>\n<utime>01/12/06 02:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
