This will help prevent direct transmission of contaminants on the cap to your print.  Let it print for a couple of hours, then print onto something else.  Use the several prints you make separately. Make the prints inside a glovebox.  Hopefully, one of them will be contaminant free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, swiping the spores on agar and isolating away from contaminants is still the preferred method.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5830801</next>\n<prev>5829734</prev>\n<first>5829685</first>\n<last>5831747</last>\n<when>1152276036</when>\n<utime>07/07/06 03:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
