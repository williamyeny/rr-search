{"key":"post-6445930","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6445930</id>\n<content>I've also found a casing layer to be of little benefit if other conditions are kept at optimum, as HC reported.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a casing layer allows us to be a bit sloppier on conditions.  For example, if you have to leave for work every day for 10 hours or more, a casing layer will protect your substrate while you can't be there to mist.  If you can hang around and babysit your crop, it makes little to no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this applies to cubes only.  Other species fruit poorly or not at all without a casing layer, and many edibles won't even fruit on a pasteurized casing, it must be untreated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6445933</next>\n<prev>6445904</prev>\n<first>6442336</first>\n<last>6449843</last>\n<when>1168473409</when>\n<utime>01/11/07 01:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
