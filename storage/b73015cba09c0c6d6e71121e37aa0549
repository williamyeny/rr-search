If your temp is higher than that, try finding a cooler place.   Thermal death doesn't occur until much higher than that, but thermophilic molds and bacteria are encouraged at higher temperatures, and the 'rate of growth' of mushroom(cubensis) mycelium falls off sharply beginning at 83F.  The oft quoted figure of 86F is just plain wrong.<br />Jars should be inoculated as soon as possible after sterilization.  I wish people would quit saying the jars need to cool past the point when they're cool to the touch.  They do NOT stay warm on the inside of the jar longer than the outside by more than a few minutes at most.  The water permeates every part of a grain or brf jar, and water is an excellent heat transferrer.  If the jar itself is cool to the touch, then the insides will be also, and that includes the middle.   Think about it.  If you have a cup of coffee get cold from sitting out too long, it isn't still hot in the center.<br />The biggest cause of failure with pf tek is not following proper sterile procedure.  You the cultivator are the biggest single source of contamination, so be very careful.  Thousands of bacteria are exhaled from your mouth with every breath, so wear a surgical mask.  Millions of bacteria reside under your fingernails, so wear gloves, and wash them with alcohol before use.   Use a glovebox, and flame the needle of your syringe red hot before use.  Alcohol might clean the outside of the needle, but contaminants can enter into the center of the needle and not be touched by the alcohol.<br />Growing mushrooms is part art, and part science, but it's not magic.  Follow proper procedures, and you'll have success.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
