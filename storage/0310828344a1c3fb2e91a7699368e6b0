It provides calcium to your substrate and can be fully beneficial at only ~2% of substrate volume. The person who started the use of gypsum here had falsely claimed the ph related effects and has since stated he was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum is and always has been added to substrates for the calcium and sulfur.&amp;nbsp; A side benefit is that gypsum tends to help prevent the pH from swinging too low due to the mycelium's metabolism.&amp;nbsp; Gypsum isn't used to change the pH one way or the other, but it does tend to keep it stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee provides a boost in production but it's not for the lazy.&amp;nbsp; If one doesn't prepare his substrates properly, mold will soon follow.&amp;nbsp; I use coffee in every substrate, and see mold about one substrate out of a thousand.&amp;nbsp; The key to getting the increased production from using coffee is proper sterile procedure and/or clean work and pasteurization at the proper temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13932333</next>\n<prev>13932220</prev>\n<first>13931437</first>\n<last>15405844</last>\n<when>1297260739</when>\n<utime>02/09/11 04:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
