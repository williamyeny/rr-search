This includes additives, grains, compost vs coir, etc.&amp;nbsp; No grain has ever shown to make more potent fruits.&amp;nbsp; If it did we'd all be using it. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The niche mushrooms occupy is to degrade organic matter, rendering 'plant food' from their metabolites.&amp;nbsp; I drain all the liquid metabolites from my mushroom substrates into the water I use for my plants.&amp;nbsp; Now, if feeding 'ferts' to mycelium makes it stronger, one could attempt to verify the theory by eating his or her own shit and let us know how it works out.&amp;nbsp; I believe the rest of us will keep the petroleum industry out of our substrates.&amp;nbsp; It's bad enough we have to get our poly bags and pp5 containers from them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19488848</next>\n<prev>19488754</prev>\n<first>19219682</first>\n<last>19495268</last>\n<when>1390970466</when>\n<utime>01/29/14 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
