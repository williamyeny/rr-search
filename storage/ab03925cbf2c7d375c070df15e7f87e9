I prefer layering, but after each layer is applied, gently shake the tray back and forth a bit so the layers 'merge'.  This seems to provide a bit faster recovery over fully mixing.  A danger with mixing is that you can damage the kernels, thus exposing uncolonized grains to the pasteurized, therefore not sterile, substrate.  If you chose to mix, be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7361902</next>\n<prev>7361897</prev>\n<first>7361563</first>\n<last>11961998</last>\n<when>1188764370</when>\n<utime>09/02/07 11:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
