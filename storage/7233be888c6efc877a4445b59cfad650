Cobweb spreads by breaking off tiny strands of mycelium and sending them in the air currents.  That's why it spreads/comes back so fast. You can see this under a microscope in a petri dish.  The dactylium mycelium wags like a dog's tail, then shoots strands across the dish.  It's really cool to watch. Be sure to spray down the entire surface of your casing layer even if the cobweb is only on a small part of it.  Use the 3% peroxide from the drug or grocery store right from the bottle.  It may take a few applications before you get it whipped.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5776729</next>\n<prev>5775609</prev>\n<first>5774353</first>\n<last>5780914</last>\n<when>1150895588</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 04:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
