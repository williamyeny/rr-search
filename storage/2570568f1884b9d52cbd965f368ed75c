The substrate doesn't get much exposure at all. Any other thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how it is commonly done using a flask. A laminar flow hood will up the success rate considerably. Syringes came along about fifteen years ago for use in pf tek, but other than that there is little use for them.&amp;nbsp; I'm pretty sure I haven't used a syringe since I filmed the sporeprinting and syringe tek for the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17860625</next>\n<prev>17860572</prev>\n<first>17838129</first>\n<last>17863072</last>\n<when>1361768161</when>\n<utime>02/25/13 06:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
