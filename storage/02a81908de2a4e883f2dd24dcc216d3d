If you use it from the start, those contaminant spores will have mostly landed on the surface of the wax paper, which is discarded every two to three days.  After four or five days, you can simply wash the surface of your substrate very well under the water faucet to rinse off most of the contaminant spores that have landed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax paper simply helps to hold a high humidity at the pinning surface.  It's even more effective with uncased substrates than with cased.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12038613</next>\n<prev>8068149</prev>\n<first>8068149</first>\n<last>12054864</last>\n<when>1203964697</when>\n<utime>02/25/08 08:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
