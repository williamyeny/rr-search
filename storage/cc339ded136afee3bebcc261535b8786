Other sites, not so much. Not at all actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad thing is, you see the overwhelming support for it listed right here. It's not the community that is holding them back, that is made obvious by this poll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it's the staff here, and it's not because we have a problem with spore rings.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's because we asked you to not to use this forum to solicit donations &lt;b&gt;in advance of starting the project&lt;/b&gt; and you went batshit over it.&amp;nbsp; Rather than realize that we look out for the interests of our members, you took it as a personal slam, as if we should know everything about you from your three months since registration, which incidentally includes repeated butthurt, trolling of vendors, and &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; two puppets you've created in addition to this account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled something fishy, and now the whole staff and most members do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DynGBreeD said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TheEaglesGift said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy supporting our sponsors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree... For many of us this is our hobby. There's vendor &lt;br /&gt;syringes that sell for something like 8-9$. If you cannot afford&lt;br /&gt;spores, how can anyone afford the rest of the materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no offence, but you haven't been around long enough for &lt;br /&gt;me to even want to donate prints. How can you expect Shroomery&lt;br /&gt;(members) support with no credibility. And I think anyone who does &lt;br /&gt;is a fool. Besides they can give them away for free themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you so badly want to help the community. Do what a lot of us &lt;br /&gt;do. Fruit and obtain your own prints and hold giveaways. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty well sums up the staff position as well.&amp;nbsp; Nobody is against anyone helping anyone else.&amp;nbsp; We don't however allow the board to be used in the manner this user is attempting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17319216</next>\n<prev>17319143</prev>\n<first>17318392</first>\n<last>17324018</last>\n<when>1354457095</when>\n<utime>12/02/12 04:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
