Don't allow the weight to giggle at all, or only once every minute or two at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil goes on top only, and you take it back off as soon as you remove the jars from the sterilizer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19007536</next>\n<prev>19007093</prev>\n<first>19006802</first>\n<last>19008192</last>\n<when>1382363647</when>\n<utime>10/21/13 04:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
