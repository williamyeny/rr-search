If you take a pen or something and smooth out the print you'll get this affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the spores are landing on top of the cap, then how on god's earth can they also be plummeting to the aluminum with such force that they dent it. Ridiculous. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wow:&quot; title=&quot;:wow:&quot;/&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wow:&quot; title=&quot;:wow:&quot;/&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wow:&quot; title=&quot;:wow:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the cap is sitting on the foil or wax paper, not suspended on its stipe.&amp;nbsp; I've never seen spores land on a cap when printing.&amp;nbsp; I've also seen the imprint and I don't flatten out my prints.&amp;nbsp; If you don't think 25,000 times the weight of a apore being projected from less than 1/8&quot; distance at the the speed a bullet leaves a rifle, times a few million spores, can't dent foil, think again before you call nonsense on the experts in the field.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms are amazing creatures, and the hydraulic pressure built as they grow is also phenomenal. I've seen mushrooms push 20 pound rocks out of their way so they could grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13083412</next>\n<prev>13083370</prev>\n<first>13080659</first>\n<last>20834204</last>\n<when>1282426363</when>\n<utime>08/22/10 12:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
