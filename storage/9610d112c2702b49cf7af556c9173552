Talk of 'strains' is just cluttering up the forum and is worthless.  Just pick one and grow it. They're all the same species.  It isn't like growing weed where strains actually make a difference and breed true to the original.  We made the strain thread to keep discussion up there out of the way.  Most of the named 'strains' for mushrooms are just that.  Names.  I could take one print and make 20 syringes out of it and put 20 different 'strain names' on them and ship those to 20 different people and they'd all grow 20 projects with different looking fruits and swear they had GT, TC, PR, etc.  Please keep these discussions up on top.<br />RR"}}
