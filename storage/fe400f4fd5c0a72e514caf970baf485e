{"key":"post-10088992","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>10088992</id>\n<content>Since the spores were a year old, they probably dried out and need to re-hydrate before germination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamets MEA is good stuff, but I always mix it a bit weak, especially when germinating spores.&amp;nbsp; I've used it for so many years, I simply put 3 1/2 tablespoons into .7 liter.&amp;nbsp; If I'm not mistaken, a tablespoon of his agar powder weighs 7 grams, so the recommended mix is 7 tablespoons per liter.&amp;nbsp; By mixing it a tad weak, the agar isn't quite so solid, thus better for spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd say you're fine.&amp;nbsp; If another week goes by without germination, add a couple of drops of sterilized water over the top of the spores.&amp;nbsp; If possible, get the temp up to 75F.&amp;nbsp; Parafilm is good, and I also usually stick the freshly poured dishes back into the sleeve they came in, and then after inoculation, I put three or four dishes into ziplock sandwich size bags, which I inflate with sterile air from the flowhood before sealing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10089049</next>\n<prev>10086301</prev>\n<first>10085944</first>\n<last>10089049</last>\n<when>1238630852</when>\n<utime>04/02/09 03:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
