If you use DE, add it dry to the dry peat and lime, then hydrate.  I think it was Agar that pointed me to using DE in casings.  It definitely holds moisture and gives bigger fruits because the same amount of casing material holds much more water without being saturated.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5617500</next>\n<prev>5617122</prev>\n<first>5616550</first>\n<last>5617571</last>\n<when>1147378986</when>\n<utime>05/11/06 11:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
