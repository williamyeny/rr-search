LMFAO. Fuck off, moron. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read nearly 20 accounts of people who said they prefer to put out their trays in fruiting conditions as soon as the myc reaches the surface as opposed to full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I fucked up because I rolled with inaccurate info but spare me your self righteousness mycology bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fucking clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock it the hell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could have saved the embarrassment by defining 'tray' in the first place.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never expose &lt;i&gt;substrates&lt;/i&gt; to fruiting before full colonization.&amp;nbsp; However, with &lt;i&gt;casing layers&lt;/i&gt; over fully colonized grains, you don't even want full colonization.&amp;nbsp; You exposed to fruiting at the correct time.&amp;nbsp; Some people patch their casing layers when mycelium first pokes through, but that's optional.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12982978</next>\n<prev>12981526</prev>\n<first>12981118</first>\n<last>12985106</last>\n<when>1280628461</when>\n<utime>08/01/10 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
