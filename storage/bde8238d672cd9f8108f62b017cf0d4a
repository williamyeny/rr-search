Bright, intense light is going to stimulate a much better pinset than dim, low light.  12/12 has shown over the years to give the best performance.  I don't even have my lights on a timer anymore unless I go out of town.  I plug them in when I get up, and unplug them sometime in the evening.  They rarely get exactly 12/12, but close.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6647231</next>\n<prev>6642524</prev>\n<first>6642359</first>\n<last>6647267</last>\n<when>1173255777</when>\n<utime>03/07/07 10:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
