Not only do they show an obvious picture of trichoderma and call it penicillin mold(penicillium?), there are many other inaccuracies as well, temperature requirements being one of them.<br />I was going to call my video 'organic mushroom growing made easy' until I saw that one.  I have a new title now, but I won't say what it is until the video comes out.  It's in post-production now.<br />Abort, feel free to quote me on anything you wish.<br />RR"}}
