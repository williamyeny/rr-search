Three logs will keep the house warm all day or night.&nbsp; We don't even have a thermostat or furnace.&nbsp; If it gets too cold, I add a log or two.&nbsp; If it gets too hot, I open the window.&nbsp; We keep it at about 75f during the day, but at night I open a few windows, because I like to sleep under a warm wool blankie.<br />I'm usually colonizing a hundred or so spawn bags, so I'm sure I get a bunch of heat from them too.&nbsp; They're always warm to the touch when picked up.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/08-51/978974052--30F.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/08-51/978974052-thumb_-30F.jpg\"></a>"}}
