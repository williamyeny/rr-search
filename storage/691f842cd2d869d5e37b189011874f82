Light is only a secondary pinning trigger.  Full colonization, a reduction in CO2 with a corresponding increase in fresh air, and 100% humidity are the primary pinning triggers.  Only when those three are met, does light play a part.  I suspect your humidity is too low.  When you have pins, allow them to grow, whatever you have to do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7085563</next>\n<prev>7085463</prev>\n<first>7085463</first>\n<last>7087113</last>\n<when>1182665887</when>\n<utime>06/24/07 09:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
