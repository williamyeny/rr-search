You can expect there to be contaminant spores near the air/inoculation holes, and if you shift the jar around, those mold spores can be shifted down and into the substrate, contaminating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a picture of one of my colonization shelves.  As you can see, quarts of rye, 1/2 pint brf jars, and filter patch bags all share a spot in the open air at normal room temperature and normal indoor lighting.  There is one time that darkness can be used to your advantage, and that is after applying a casing layer.  Cover the colonizing casing layer with foil to keep CO2 levels high and also to keep light off.  This way, when you remove the foil, you introduce all the pinning triggers of full colonization, air exchange, light, drop in CO2 levels, and evaporation of moisture from the substrate at the same time.  This can trigger massive pinsets.  However, during the colonization phase, light is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6857532</next>\n<prev>6856476</prev>\n<first>6856211</first>\n<last>6857730</last>\n<when>1178034211</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 06:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
