Ground limestone takes too long to break down and go to work.  Hydrated lime is water soluable and goes to work right away.  A combination of hydrated lime and gypsum is the best way to buffer a casing layer.  The most critical time for contaminants to enter a casing is during the initial colonization and first flush stages.  Once the layer is fully colonized, it's very contaminant resistant.  Hydrated lime and gypsum protect your casing layer during this critical early stage, where ground limestone or other buffers that take weeks or even months to break down do not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5846285</next>\n<prev>5846243</prev>\n<first>5846209</first>\n<last>5846299</last>\n<when>1152633377</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 06:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
