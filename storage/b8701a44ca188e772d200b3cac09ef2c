That's a pretty good pinset, so it's going to take a LOT of water to get them to grow.  You need to be really pouring the water to them, perhaps even pulling the foil back and pouring it directly around the edges so it can soak in.  Just don't waterlog the substrate.  After you pour the water to it, make sure a few hours later it's all soaked in.  If not, pour the excess back out, or suck it out with a basting syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 'choad' shape is related to genetics, not air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6866808</next>\n<prev>6866688</prev>\n<first>6865286</first>\n<last>6874732</last>\n<when>1178208312</when>\n<utime>05/03/07 07:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
