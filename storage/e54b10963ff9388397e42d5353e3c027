One, it helps to hydrate/germinate the bacterial endospores so they can be killed in the PC.  At different times of the year, and in different parts of the world, grains have more endospores.  Also, the longer the rye has been stored, the more likely it is to have contaminants.  The soak first helps to ensure a more complete sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason for soaking is it slowly hydrates the kernels, so they soften up gradually, which cuts way down on burst kernels later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a few rinses of the grains before soaking.  If you'll fill a pot with your dry grains and water, then swirl it around, you'll see all the dust and chaff come to the surface where you can pour it off.  Rinse a few times until the water pours off clear, then soak.  This will help prevent clumping later.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add your gypsum to the soak water if you do it this way.  I use a tablespoon of gypsum for each ten cups of grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5946960</next>\n<prev>5946517</prev>\n<first>5946517</first>\n<last>5946960</last>\n<when>1155121512</when>\n<utime>08/09/06 02:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
