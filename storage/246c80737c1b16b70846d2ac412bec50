{"key":"post-1804252","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>1804252</id>\n<content>I make absolutely NO attempt to take sterile prints.  I simply lay the cap on a piece of typing paper in the open room, and place a coffee filter over the top to allow air exchange, and keep the worst of the dust, or bugs off it.  All you have to do is scrape some spores onto agar, and as soon as the spores germinate, grab a small piece of the mycelia and transfer it to a new petri dish.  Do this a few times and you have a perfectly clean strain to work with.  Just remember, always transfer healthy mycelia away from contams into a new dish.  Never the other way around.  If you try to move the contam, you will just spread it all over.  If you're wanting to make a spore syringe, you need a sterile print.  If you use agar, it doesn't matter.  Hope this answered your question. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1804321</next>\n<prev>1804237</prev>\n<first>1803692</first>\n<last>1804416</last>\n<when>1060671622</when>\n<utime>08/12/03 10:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
