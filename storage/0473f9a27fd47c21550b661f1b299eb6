It will actually begin to look like rain in there.  That's why you're having so much runoff.  A coolmist is really at it's best if you shoot to maintain 80% to 90%.  Above that and dripping/standing water is going to be a real problem.  I have the exact same model humidifier.  if you'll run it 1 minute on, 5 minutes off, you'll maintain 85% or so with very little to no dripping water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5434716</prev>\n<first>5368568</first>\n<last>5434846</last>\n<when>1143150947</when>\n<utime>03/23/06 11:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
