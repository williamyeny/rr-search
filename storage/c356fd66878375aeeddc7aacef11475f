They release the maggots into the wound to eat the dead tissue.  They won't hurt your substrate.  I understand about getting the creeps though.  I was eating a wild picked mushie once and could see the gills 'moving'.  I thought it was just the effects of the shroom, but then my wife saw it and freaked out.  It was crawling with maggots and I had just eaten half the cap.   Sorta lost my appetite after that...lol<br />RR"}}
