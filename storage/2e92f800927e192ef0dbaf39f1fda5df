So substrate makes a big difference in potency? What other substrate would be good for a newb?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither the 'name' on the syringe or the substrate has squat to do with potency.&amp;nbsp; BRF cakes will deliver the same potency as any other substrate.&amp;nbsp; Strain is irrelevant too. If you want to discuss strains, use the strain thread at the top of the page.&amp;nbsp; You won't find any experienced growers telling you any 'strain' is more potent than any other, nor will you find any experienced growers telling you one substrate will deliver more potency than another.&amp;nbsp; The reason for switching to grains and bulk substrate is for volume, not quality.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10175195</next>\n<prev>10174925</prev>\n<first>10173534</first>\n<last>10179539</last>\n<when>1239857804</when>\n<utime>04/16/09 07:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
