There were 11 jars to start, and we set them in the closet, lids on and up, covered with tin foil with a heater for 3 days. We decided to take off the tin foil, flip them upside down, and we checked them 15 hours later, to discover our temperature was somewhere between 86 and 89 degrees Farenheit, and that 5 jars had become contaminated with a dark brown mold that I assume is a penicillin mold (anyone able to correct?). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't read past that part because it was bad enough to ensure fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the foil as soon as they come out of the sterilizer.&amp;nbsp; You don't 'need' to use the pressure cooker as just a steaming pot for 90 minutes works fine.&amp;nbsp; Colonize at normal room temperature right-side-up.&amp;nbsp; Closets suck.&amp;nbsp; Put them on a shelf out in the open.&amp;nbsp; Nobody knows wtf they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start over and use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek videos&lt;/a&gt; next time.&amp;nbsp; I suggest not changing anything your first time as it's been proved to work as advertised about 50,000 times to far.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18911318</next>\n<prev>18911200</prev>\n<first>18910586</first>\n<last>22089035</last>\n<when>1380567711</when>\n<utime>09/30/13 10:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
