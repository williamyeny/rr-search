{"key":"post-6659823","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6659823</id>\n<content>Those two posts of mine say the same thing in different wording for different contexts.  By the time a jar colonizes, it is usually one strain, down from hundreds at germination.  It's best to fruit them separately, but if you're going to use three multispore jars in the same substrate, then adding one more won't matter one whit.  It doesn't matter the name on the syringe.  What you actually have is four 'strains' at this point.  Mix them all you want. The one jar that had a different name on the syringe is little different from the other three.   Look at strains similar to 'races' in humans or 'breeds' in dogs.  A german shepard can easily mate with a rottweiler, and a human from siberia can easily mate with a human from south america.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6659801</prev>\n<first>6659801</first>\n<last>6659823</last>\n<when>1173670328</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 06:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
