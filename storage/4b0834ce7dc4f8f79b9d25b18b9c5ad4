This is the exact same bullshit that happens in advanced every time somebody starts this type of thread.  Talk, talk, talk, talk and nothing but talk.  Nobody ever does ANYTHING, and those of us who have, like myself, reported NO increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until somebody actually DOES this instead of talking about it, and can report the results and make them repeatable, I'm going to lock down these threads as soon as they pop up.  There is nothing in this thread that hasn't already been said in hundreds of others just like it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7605657</prev>\n<first>7601291</first>\n<last>7605951</last>\n<when>1194450114</when>\n<utime>11/07/07 05:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
