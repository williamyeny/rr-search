That is plenty to sterilize the syringe itself. Take it straight from the boiling water to your glovebox. You'll want some sterile water as well, so the best way to get that is to put a filter patch, tyvek or polyfill lid on a jar of distilled water and PC it for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6732210</next>\n<prev>6732040</prev>\n<first>6731204</first>\n<last>6735285</last>\n<when>1175376073</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 12:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
