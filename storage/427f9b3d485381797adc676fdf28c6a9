There will be plenty of moisture for first flush even after a 2 to 3 month consolidation phase after full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12804341</next>\n<prev>12800193</prev>\n<first>12796772</first>\n<last>12924430</last>\n<when>1277482758</when>\n<utime>06/25/10 07:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
