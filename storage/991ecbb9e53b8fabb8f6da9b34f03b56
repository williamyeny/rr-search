By then, your substrate or casing will be either finished or green.  You want a water soluable lime such as hydrated lime.  You can order it online from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt;   Just do a search for 'hydrated lime' once you get to the site.  Order the 'good earth' or 'hoffman's'.  They're both made by the same company.  Avoid the dolomitic or concrete stuff.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4908683</prev>\n<first>4908571</first>\n<last>4908906</last>\n<when>1131476236</when>\n<utime>11/08/05 08:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
