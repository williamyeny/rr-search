Hydrated means water soluable, thus it's ground to a fine powder in order to be effective right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime can be hard to find locally if you live in an area that has alkaline soil.  In areas where the soil is acidic, lime is sold everywhere.  You can order it online from doitbest.com  Just search for 'hydrated lime' when you get to their site.  They have two industrial types, and two horticultural types of hydrated lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6052912</next>\n<prev>6052621</prev>\n<first>6052621</first>\n<last>6053250</last>\n<when>1158077304</when>\n<utime>09/12/06 07:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
