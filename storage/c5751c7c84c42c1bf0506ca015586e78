This includes additives, grains, compost vs coir, etc.&nbsp; No grain has ever shown to make more potent fruits.&nbsp; If it did we'd all be using it. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />The niche mushrooms occupy is to degrade organic matter, rendering 'plant food' from their metabolites.&nbsp; I drain all the liquid metabolites from my mushroom substrates into the water I use for my plants.&nbsp; Now, if feeding 'ferts' to mycelium makes it stronger, one could attempt to verify the theory by eating his or her own shit and let us know how it works out.&nbsp; I believe the rest of us will keep the petroleum industry out of our substrates.&nbsp; It's bad enough we have to get our poly bags and pp5 containers from them.<br />RR"}}
