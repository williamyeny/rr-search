Drill four holes in the metal lid that are syringe needle size, but no larger.  These will allow gas exchange, but are small enough that the grains don't hit the filter material when you shake.  This keeps your filter clean and dry.  If you puncture the tyvek with a needle, tape over the hole.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6998960</next>\n<prev>6998820</prev>\n<first>6998704</first>\n<last>7131703</last>\n<when>1180794721</when>\n<utime>06/02/07 05:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
