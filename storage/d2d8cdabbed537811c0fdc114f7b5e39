Because I got a humidifier today and hooked a hose up to my fc because I wants getting proper humidity, it's very dry here in the winter, but right now the humidifier is running full blast and its really wet inside not pools of water wet but more wet than a misting, is this ok? I'll post a pic in the morning of what the condensation looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt; and stop trying to fix what isn't broken until it is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never run a humidifier into a shotgun terrarium because if you followed the tek the humidity will be in the upper 90%&amp;nbsp; range.&amp;nbsp; There will also never be condensation on the walls of a properly constructed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mutant blob is usually from failure to wait at least a week after full colonization before birthing the cakes.&amp;nbsp; BRF is too nutritious(which causes the mutants) for fruiting, so it's good to let the mycelium eat some of it before exposing to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17424308</next>\n<prev>17423553</prev>\n<first>17401786</first>\n<last>17427897</last>\n<when>1356053320</when>\n<utime>12/21/12 03:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
