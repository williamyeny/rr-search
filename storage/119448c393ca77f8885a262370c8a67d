Cover them tightly with foil now, and in a few days they'll be ready to move to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; Just leave those deformed pins.&nbsp; Pick the large ones off when you introduce to fruiting conditions.&nbsp; The smaller ones will probably develop normally once you add lighting.<br />Reduce the ambient temp during colonization to 75F.<br />RR"}}
