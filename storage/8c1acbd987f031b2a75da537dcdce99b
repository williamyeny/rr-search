{"key":"post-6002854","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6002854</id>\n<content>This has all been covered many, many times before.  In fact, I have made a standing offer of $100 to the first person who can produce a 10 gram or larger fruitbody from hydroponics.  I doubt seriously I'll ever have to pay up, but if I do it will be worth it to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, mushrooms are not plants.  Mycelium doesn't require nutrients the way plants in sunlight do. Mycelium requires food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, mycelium is MUCH more like mammals than plants.  Plants take in CO2 and give off O2.  Mycelium does the opposite.  Mycelium doesn't have the sun to help with metabolism, and makes its own 'body heat', which again requires food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, fruitbodies form in response to environmental conditions that tell the mycelium it needs to reproduce or die.  The mushroom is the sexual reproductive organ of the mycelium.  The pinning triggers are impending starvation(full colonization), thirst(steady rate of evaporation from the substrate), rapid influx of fresh air(using all the food and being forced into open air) and light(don't go towards the light!!), all of which signal impending death.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be awfully hard, but probably not impossible to duplicate all those phenomena in the lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for those of you who wish to go on endlessly about how it's possible, please take my $100 bill and show us, rather than just talking about it.  You better photo-document the entire process well.  Don't just show a rockwool cube with a mushroom stuck in it. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6002864</next>\n<prev>6002777</prev>\n<first>5998914</first>\n<last>6040242</last>\n<when>1156731641</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 05:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
