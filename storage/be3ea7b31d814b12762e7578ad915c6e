You want to make sure the mycelium does NOT enter the perlite.  Lift them up and do as I suggested above, cutting away the mycelium that has departed the cake.  Your mycelium will waste energy on cell-division with no intake of food by colonizing the perlite.<br />In addition, water logged cakes perform poorly.  You want your cake to dry out slightly during a flush, then you re-hydrate for the next flush.  Mist as required to supply the moisture needed as the fruits grow.<br />RR"}}
