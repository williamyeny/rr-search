If you're going to do anything to help them along, you'd want to give an acidic environment, rather than a high pH.  Mushroom mycelium as well as molds prefer a low pH.  PF cakes are sterile and kept sterile during colonization, so there is no reason to use anything to raise the pH for mold control.  If you were not sterile, the cake will contaminate regardless of pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't confuse the methods we apply to casing layers with those used for spawn, which must be generated under sterile conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7768487</next>\n<prev>7764364</prev>\n<first>7762114</first>\n<last>7768487</last>\n<when>1197823756</when>\n<utime>12/16/07 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
