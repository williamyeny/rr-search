I also disagree strongly with the advice to make LC out of syringes.  That's a weenie way to make liquid culture.  I would never consider making liquid culture with an unproved strain.  You're better off using your syringe to inoculate the jars directly.  Once you learn grains, you can do a grain to grain transfer, or even two or three g2g's, and expand your mycelium much farther and faster than you can squirting spores into sugar water and hoping for the best, which I strongly recommend against.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7004456</next>\n<prev>7004414</prev>\n<first>7004146</first>\n<last>7014754</last>\n<when>1180915937</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 03:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
