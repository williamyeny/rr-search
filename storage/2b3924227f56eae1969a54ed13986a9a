Then What I do is fill half pint jars with coir and use a tyvek filter on them, I boil the jars with one jar having a thermometer stck throuch the tyvek, I let it pasteurize at 150-170 (sometime I go over) for about 30-60 min. The next day when its cool I quickly open the jars and put them in filter patch bags, using a spawn ratio of 1:1 up to 1:2. Then I seal the bags quickly with duck tape. .&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not just pasteurize in the bag and then when it's cool spawn to it?&amp;nbsp; That eliminates a vector of contamination.&amp;nbsp; However, that's not the problem, contaminated spawn is.&amp;nbsp; Pasteurized coir won't contaminate with green molds before first flush unless your original pf cakes were contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12546278</next>\n<prev>12544641</prev>\n<first>12537335</first>\n<last>12546315</last>\n<when>1273625000</when>\n<utime>05/12/10 03:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
