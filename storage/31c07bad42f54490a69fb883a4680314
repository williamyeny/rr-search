{"key":"post-7047072","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7047072</id>\n<content>For a 9&quot; diameter straw log, you'll want to select the 14&quot; width roll.  Use 4 mil.  If you use less than 4 mil thickness, it will rip when you stuff the straw in.  Using the link above as a reference, the 4 mil, 14&quot; width will cost you $87.29 for a 1075 foot roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could go with the 18&quot; width, at $113.86 per roll, to make an 11.5&quot; diameter log.  I wouldn't go thicker than that.  The 16&quot; width will give you a log 10&quot; in diameter.  The straw log shown in my video is 10&quot; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graingers is a bit cheaper if you have one in your area and have a business license.  You can get small lengths from fungi perfect, but the price is double the above, or more.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7047879</next>\n<prev>7046914</prev>\n<first>7046902</first>\n<last>7052280</last>\n<when>1181866050</when>\n<utime>06/15/07 03:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
