Don't incubate over 80F, especially a large substrate.  Higher temps favor bacteria and thermophilic molds over the mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a mechanical hygrometer that can be calibrated.  99% of the digital ones are crap above 90% humidity.  Cigar shops are a good place to look.  I get mine for ten bucks and they stay within a point or two of being correct in between calibrations.  I calibrate them three or four times per year.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6463369</next>\n<prev>6463146</prev>\n<first>6463071</first>\n<last>6464113</last>\n<when>1168907498</when>\n<utime>01/16/07 02:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
