What about the air displacement caused by moving my arms in and out of the holes? . . .If I pull my arms out even slightly air has to rush in to fill the space which would create a current. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct.  Don't pull your arms in or out while you have a jar or petri dish open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cubenisseur said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn't clean bare skin be less likely to hold contams than a shirt(cloth)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.  The freshly laundered shirt will not have several thousand dead skin cells per hour flaking off.  Always wear freshly cleaned long sleeved clothing when doing sterile work.  Never work naked.  In years past we were advised to shower, then work naked.  That's been proved to be bad advice.  We must protect our projects from ourselves, the number one vector of contamination.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874691</next>\n<prev>5874621</prev>\n<first>5874170</first>\n<last>5878629</last>\n<when>1153270469</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
