Removing them after use might help, but they really need a few hours to stabilize. I take a water hose to my grow area three times daily, flooding the whole darn thing from ceiling to floor, and the water then goes out the floor drains. Even my $250 digital hygrometer is as inaccurate as the cheap bastards, and it's located in the dry room with a remote sensor.&amp;nbsp; For accurate readings, get a real hair hygrometer.&amp;nbsp; They're spendy but super accurate.&amp;nbsp; I built a drip shield to keep the direct water spray off mine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12977472</next>\n<prev>12974082</prev>\n<first>12973814</first>\n<last>12978031</last>\n<when>1280454802</when>\n<utime>07/30/10 04:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
