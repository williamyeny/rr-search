I've never known fruits to bias one side of a tub/cake because it was closer to light; any light bright enough to provide adequate illumination will spill sufficiently to the &quot;far-side&quot; of the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium is a single organism, therefore light anywhere on a substrate will help stimulate pinning anywhere else on the substrate where conditions are right.&amp;nbsp; However, as the mushrooms grow, they'll turn towards the light to use as much energy from it as possible.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13306402</next>\n<prev>13305077</prev>\n<first>13305029</first>\n<last>13334823</last>\n<when>1286514697</when>\n<utime>10/08/10 08:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
