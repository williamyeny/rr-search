You can bury it into a pile of manure in a shady spot in your yard though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are killed by very low temperatures, so if you PC'd the rye, the mold spores were introduced later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you soak/simmer with coffee, use no more than 25 percent of the soak water as coffee.  About half drinking strength seems to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7397899</prev>\n<first>7397899</first>\n<last>7398548</last>\n<when>1189567000</when>\n<utime>09/12/07 06:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
