It was just overall a failed experiment (most certainly failed on my part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I tried I used brown rice, which I think I burnt in the oven, crushed up some of it to try to make something akin to flour (but used this very sparingly), and the vermiculite. I must have done something better or avoided a previous error, because the substrate didn't get the goop effect. It was kind of clumpy. I was worried that it wasn't moist enough because it just didn't seem like it, but then I remembered reading posts on this forum of people commenting on photos with stuff like 'looks like you used too much water.' So I thought well maybe I am almost falling for that mistake. So I didn't add more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I put the jars in a large pot and filled it with water just over the jars, and I boiled them for 30 minutes with a glass lid on the pot. I honestly do not know the difference between this and a pressure cooker, but I was trying to get as close as I could to the pressure cooker effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I guess I gotta see if and how badly contamination grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You did just about everything wrong that you could have done wrong.&amp;nbsp; That is not the procedure at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the wrong recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't mix the verm and rice flour and then add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes 90 minutes to steam sterilize, not half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never let the water touch your jars during the sterilization.&amp;nbsp; Only the steam should touch the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest you follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek videos&lt;/a&gt; next time.&amp;nbsp; There's been a few thousand brand new growers succeed on their very first time using them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16239737</next>\n<prev>16238095</prev>\n<first>16237003</first>\n<last>16240888</last>\n<when>1337172977</when>\n<utime>05/16/12 03:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
