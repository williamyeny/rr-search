I'd suggest using the jar itself as a FC as you see in the picture below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's common for a few grains that are pushed up tight against the glass to not look colonized.  If you're worried, you can shake the grains well, and they should recover in 36 to 48 hours.  Then, you'll know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;85% to 95% is from 14% to 4% too low.  You want 99% humidity with lots of air exchange to stimulate pinning.  You also want to wait one full week after full colonization before birthing-dunk and roll.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/032303-8/5696-old_tech1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/032303-8/5696-thumb_old_tech1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6888350</next>\n<prev>6888298</prev>\n<first>6888298</first>\n<last>6888350</last>\n<when>1178636611</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
