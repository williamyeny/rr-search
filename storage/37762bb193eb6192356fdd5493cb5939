You need to wrap with parafilm to prevent contaminants.  The 'stackable' have an indentation so the top dish fits into the bottom dish.  They're more of a pain to work with imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After pasteurization, I lift the straw out of the tote with a strainer, allow it to drain for a few seconds, and then place on a screen that is laying in the bottom of a second tote.  When the pasteurization tote is empty(of straw), I take potfulls of hot water out of it, and pour them into the toilet to get rid of them.  By the time the straw has cooled, it has also drained long enough.  Remember, you're going to have holes in your straw log and/or laundry basket, so any excess water will drain out during the first few days, leaving it at the perfect moisture content..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we have vendors that sell boxes of 500 petri dishes?  I don't know of any.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7108654</next>\n<prev>7107996</prev>\n<first>7107742</first>\n<last>7114826</last>\n<when>1183157404</when>\n<utime>06/30/07 01:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
