{"key":"post-6541038","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6541038</id>\n<content>No, because there's nothing advanced about doing LC with fruit juice.  It's been done for years, usually without much success. However, why cultivate toxic mushroom mycelium in the first place?    Whoever's been doing those cultures sounds like they read one too many james arthur books.  Here's a few quotes.  You'll see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this has raised a great debate and question about Jesus and Christ. It is obvious to me, that this is how Jesus made The Living Bread, capable of making thousands of loaves of bread. It also makes sense how one could turn water into wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we are all sparks of The Divine, how can one be seperated as &quot;The Annointed One&quot;? Why did Jesus speak of The Christ in third person? In my opinion, if we are all emanations of God, the only true &quot;prophets&quot; (God on Earth) are sacraments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting to feel like Jesus must have, when he did this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the only way to remove the carbon atom from the molecule and create your psychoactive agent. Hope this helps. &lt;b&gt;I've never tried this&lt;/b&gt;, so give it your best shot and tell us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiencing the God within this mushroom, allows one to experience God with in himself. Viewing the world through a child's eyes, one can remember his place amongst the cosmos. To see yourself from outside, postulates relativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6542542</next>\n<prev>6540549</prev>\n<first>6540549</first>\n<last>11442771</last>\n<when>1170890246</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
