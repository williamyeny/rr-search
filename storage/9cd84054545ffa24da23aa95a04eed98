In fact, they can get away without heat treating it at all.  Those of us like myself who live just downwind from large rainforests with high trichoderma spore loads have to take every precaution.  That means pasteruizing casing and bulk substrates at 140F to 170F for an hour, but no longer than 1 1/2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6193078</next>\n<prev>6192831</prev>\n<first>6192553</first>\n<last>6193078</last>\n<when>1161406890</when>\n<utime>10/21/06 08:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
