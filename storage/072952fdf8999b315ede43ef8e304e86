Primordia grows by cell division.  Once they're fully formed mushrooms(ie pins), they grow by cell expansion, but not entirely. Basidia are single cells that produce spores at the ends of tube-like projections called sterigmata, and they're located on the gills.  A larger cap will have more basidia, thus more spores.  In other words, you'll get far more spores from a large cap than a small one.<br />When we say mushrooms grow by cell expansion, it doesn't mean that <i>no new cells </i>are produced. It means these additional cells do not directly contribute to growth.<br />RR"}}
