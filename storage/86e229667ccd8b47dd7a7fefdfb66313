Since water droplets are heavier than air, put your humidifier up high and let the pipe enter at the top.  Personally, I put the humidifier inside the greenhouse on the second from the top shelf.  That's why one minute on, six to ten off gives perfect humidity.  Just tweak your system and you'll be fine. You can also cut a few slits in the plastic sheeting top and bottom for fresh air exchange, freeing up the humidifier for humidity duty alone.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5735720</next>\n<prev>5735650</prev>\n<first>5735539</first>\n<last>5735720</last>\n<when>1149995968</when>\n<utime>06/11/06 06:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
