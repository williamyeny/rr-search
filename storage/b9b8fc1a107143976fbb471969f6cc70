Pasteurized material should not be stored for long periods, for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, bear in mind, it doesn't matter how long the pasteurization water has been at 170F, if your material is in a bag, what matters is how long the center of the casing material or compost/manure has been at 170F.  If you're using bags to pasteurize in, try the filter patch bags.  They can be sealed with a twist tie or wire, and used again and again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6154123</next>\n<prev>6154072</prev>\n<first>6153822</first>\n<last>6154726</last>\n<when>1160506070</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 09:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
