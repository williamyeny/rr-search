Incubate on a shelf in your bedroom.  If it's cold in there, run a space heater.  Normal(74F) room temperature works just fine.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6074245</next>\n<prev>6072555</prev>\n<first>6066555</first>\n<last>6075086</last>\n<when>1158566307</when>\n<utime>09/18/06 10:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
