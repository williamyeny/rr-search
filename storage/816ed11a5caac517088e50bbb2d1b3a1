If you're not sure if it's Dactylium(cobweb) or not, simply wait 24 hours and look again.  If it looks the same, it's not cobweb mold, because cobweb will cover a whole cake in 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide is death to cobweb mold, and really screws your mushroom mycelium up too, but usually doesn't kill it.  You only want to spray peroxide if absolutely necessary.  Cobweb is also rare on fully colonized cakes.  It tends to grow on the uncolonized parts of a casing layer.  Lots of air exchange will prevent it, so up your air exchange and you won't have trouble with cobweb.  Do whatever you need to also increase your moisture content, because for good performance, cakes should be kept at 99% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6897589</next>\n<prev>6897233</prev>\n<first>6896843</first>\n<last>6908942</last>\n<when>1178818916</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 08:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
