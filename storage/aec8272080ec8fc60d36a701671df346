I've also seen master slants under water survive two or three years in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't dunk in the jars.  It takes pressure to hydrate the mycelium.  Dunking isn't hydrating the substrate, which is fully colonized.  Dunking is to hydrate the individual mycelium cells, which takes time and a higher pressure outside the cell wall than inside(osmosis) for hydration to occur.  Dunk in a large kettle or bucket, etc., so the cake can be pushed completely under water, thus providing the pressure required.  Soak the cakes in this manner for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7710051</next>\n<prev>7709601</prev>\n<first>7709274</first>\n<last>7714330</last>\n<when>1196699734</when>\n<utime>12/03/07 06:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
