(and if so, how )&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.  More than one strain can be present in an individual fruit.  Thus, a clone is not an isolated strain, unless it was grown from an isolated line of mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6293792</next>\n<prev>6293765</prev>\n<first>5831095</first>\n<last>11196420</last>\n<when>1163790666</when>\n<utime>11/17/06 09:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
