Rinse well before soaking, boil rapidly after the soak, and then pour out on a strainer so they can evaporate until the outside of the grains are dry before loading jars.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Here's the method&lt;/a&gt; I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alcohol wipe on a syringe needle does little good.&amp;nbsp; Contaminants will be INside the needle too, so you need to flame until red hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synthetic filter disks are great, but don't inject through them.&amp;nbsp; Micropore tape is fine, but use smaller holes than 1/4&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Too much air during colonization will lead to early pinning in the jar.&amp;nbsp; Use four 1/8&quot; holes instead of the two 1/4&quot; holes.&amp;nbsp; After inoculation, have a fresh piece of micropore tape ready and tape over the damaged piece.&amp;nbsp;  Use a glovebox, and get some surgical gloves.&amp;nbsp; Dust masks are useless.&amp;nbsp; Go to the drug store and get a surgical mask.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9423176</prev>\n<first>9419982</first>\n<last>9431607</last>\n<when>1229300576</when>\n<utime>12/15/08 02:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
