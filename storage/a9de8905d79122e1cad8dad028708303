It's the seed for lawn and pasture grass, and if you use it, you want to use 1/2 as much water by volume as grass seed.  For 1/2 liter by volume of grass seed, only use 1/4 liter of water.  The correct amount of gypsum to use in a jar is what you can hold in a pinch between your thumb and forefinger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use rye berries, rinse them very well before using. It's the dirt and chaff that makes them stick together later.  I use gypsum in rye berry jars as well.  Use equal amounts of water and grain by volume.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5765395</next>\n<prev>5764636</prev>\n<first>5764492</first>\n<last>5766623</last>\n<when>1150674544</when>\n<utime>06/19/06 02:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
