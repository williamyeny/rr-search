Use it at <i>up to</i> ten percent along with the gypsum.  If you choose to use hydrated lime, a teaspoon per cup.  However, bulk substrates rarely need pH asjustment unless you're using coffee. If using manure, skip the lime and just use gypsum.  The ph will settle out in the high 6 range.<br />Save the lime for your casing layer.<br />RR"}}
