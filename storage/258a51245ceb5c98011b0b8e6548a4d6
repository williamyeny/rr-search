Pictures and all in the tutorial it self?&amp;nbsp; Id like to spread the word on how to grow.&amp;nbsp; Ive seen books of how to grow weed being sold in stores and i dont see how this would be any different...&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mushroom2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot; title=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a difference between 'legal' and 'smart'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, magic mushrooms are still just mushrooms, and in the final analysis pot is little more than a commercial farm commodity, something humans have been producing since the dawn of civilization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always found pot growing books to be poorly written, even worse edited, and mostly dumb hype.&amp;nbsp; Ditto for 'magic mushroom' books.&amp;nbsp; If one is a master gardener, he can grow pot well because he understands how plants function and grow.&amp;nbsp; If one is a master mushroom grower and desires to cultivate mushrooms of a particular species, he can do that because he understands what mycelium needs to grow and fruit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a book about nothing but cubes would indicate a lack of experience on the part of the author, just as a pot book shouldn't be taken as a scholarly horticultural text.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18857721</next>\n<prev>18857136</prev>\n<first>18856785</first>\n<last>18859009</last>\n<when>1379521670</when>\n<utime>09/18/13 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
