In fact, I don't recommend blood meal anymore, even though I did in the past.  I've found that a lot of bloodmeal is bad, and a small amount really doesn't help at all.  It seems the blood meal really needs to be composted along with the substrate to be of much good.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're composting, blood meal will add nitrogen that will help to heat up the pile, but after numerous side by side tests, I found no benefit to adding it to a substrate.  I apologize that some of my previous posts recommended it, so please disregard those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need food grade gypsum.  Just pick some up at a garden center.  In fact, the 'garden gypsum' I get from my local Lowe's and garden centers is made from the broken up scraps from a drywall plant.  Sheetrock and other brands of drywall are composed of calcium sulphate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6667095</next>\n<prev>6664733</prev>\n<first>6663809</first>\n<last>6667095</last>\n<when>1173814571</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 10:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
