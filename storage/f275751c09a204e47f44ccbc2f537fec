They either flood the substrates, provide insufficient fresh air, or dry out the terrarium.<br />It's why I designed the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> a few years ago.&nbsp; It works well, and is based on sound engineering.&nbsp; Build it per the tek and it will maintain 95% or better humidity and provide the air exchange necessary to grow mushrooms.<br />RR"}}
