The mycelium of trich is white, but it's shaped different from mushroom mycelium.  Trich looks more like a 'polka dot' myc.  When you see that, you can dump the project before it ever turns green.  This will save your grow area from the spore dump.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3979578</next>\n<prev>3978783</prev>\n<first>3978783</first>\n<last>4207744</last>\n<when>1112011564</when>\n<utime>03/28/05 02:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
