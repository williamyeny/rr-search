Don't help perpetuate the myth.  We don't refer to gasoline as 'water' and we don't refer to rocks as 'substrate', so please don't refer to the antibiotic production of mycelium by a vulgar term that implies it should be flushed.  That makes it hard for the new people to learn, and then they in turn give bad advice to others keeping the cycle alive.<br />RR"}}
