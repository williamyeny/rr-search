{"key":"post-6541977","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6541977</id>\n<content>Exactly what is the misinformation you two are talking about?  Bulk substrate IS less nutritious than grains.  That's why we need to use so much of it.  Bulk substrate can be simply pasteurized, while the much more nutritious grains must be sterilized and kept sterile until colonized.  Then, they add significantly to the total nutrients in the bulk substrate they're spawned into.  I thought it was pretty good information. Am I missing something?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6542247</next>\n<prev>6541952</prev>\n<first>6541165</first>\n<last>6550103</last>\n<when>1170904059</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
