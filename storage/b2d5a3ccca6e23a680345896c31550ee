I've always stuck to a breaking up a layer of mycelium, mixing it with some more substrate and casing it with vermiculite on top and have gotten great yields. Don't worry about the baking soda either. Just make sure to keep then hydrated and honestly just know when to leave them alone, but you can mix some hydrogen peroxide with the water you use to spray (very small amount) this keeps the ph down and keeps some sterility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't make shit up if you don't know the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, it's long been known that casing cakes is a waste and an additional vector of contamination.&amp;nbsp; It's also known that if you don't lime casing material it is very susceptible to molds, usually prior to first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never use baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mist with peroxide except to control an active cobweb mold infestation.&amp;nbsp; Don't use it as part of your misting regimen.&amp;nbsp; Peroxide isn't used to 'keep the pH down' especially considering we use lime in casing mixes &lt;i&gt;to raise the pH.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either spawn your cakes to a bulk substrate such as manure, coir, straw, etc., and fruit them uncased, or fruit your cakes as cakes(which is the fastest way to get mushrooms).&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15372710</next>\n<prev>15371201</prev>\n<first>15370379</first>\n<last>15372710</last>\n<when>1321330056</when>\n<utime>11/15/11 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
