It is during this time period of &quot;no misting&quot; that the cakes dry out (usually over 2-3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the problem.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should continue misting, and to hell with misting the sides.&amp;nbsp; What good does that do in a 99% humidity environment?.&amp;nbsp; It isn't misting that causes aborts, but rather misting and then sealing up in an 'old school' air tight terrarium while the pins are still wet.&amp;nbsp; If you provide plenty of fresh air to your terrarium, you can and should gently mist the cakes (and fruits) from birthing right through harvest.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8739477</next>\n<prev>8738665</prev>\n<first>8738318</first>\n<last>8744431</last>\n<when>1218139836</when>\n<utime>08/07/08 11:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
