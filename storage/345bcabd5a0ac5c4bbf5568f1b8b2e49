Pick fruits as they mature, and it's not necessary to pick all the fruits at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd also like to send a message here.  You bumped your own post after 4 minutes.  Shroomery rules state not to bump your own posts for a full 48 hours at least.  I've sent several friendly reminders to people, but I'm going to start locking threads per the rules.  It's not fair to other people who are waiting for replies for people to bump their own posts back to the top of the line.  This is a general message to everyone, not you in particular.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6639146</next>\n<prev>6639095</prev>\n<first>6638984</first>\n<last>6639146</last>\n<when>1173148188</when>\n<utime>03/06/07 04:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
