Often, when a grain jar is left too long after full colonization, metabolites will begin building up in the bottom of the jar.  These can be poured right on an infection in another tray.  If caught in time, many molds can be neutralized this way.  I doubt it's the antibiotic properties of the metabolites at work against molds, but rather the solvents.  Antibiotics are effective against bacteria, which isn't a contaminant of casing layers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7155482</next>\n<prev>7154391</prev>\n<first>7119655</first>\n<last>7155482</last>\n<when>1184069871</when>\n<utime>07/10/07 03:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
