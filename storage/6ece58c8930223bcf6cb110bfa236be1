Cubensis is a tropical species that fruits during hot weather and does not benefit in any way from a cold shock.  In fact, it slows down fruiting considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunking over night in the refrigerator is not cold shocking.  It is recommended in order to prevent bacteria buildup during the time the cake is under water and can't fend for itself.  If it's not practical to dunk in the refrigerator, you can simply change out the water with fresh every 8 hours or so.  Rinse the cake well under the faucet before and after the dunk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6886144</next>\n<prev>6886111</prev>\n<first>6886111</first>\n<last>18589193</last>\n<when>1178589343</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 04:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
