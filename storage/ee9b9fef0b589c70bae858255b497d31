Most pressure cookers can only hold one or two half gallons, but can hold far more than twice that amount of quarts.  In addition, half gallons can be a bitch to get colonized, often having gas exchange problems in the core due to the thickness of the grains.  You also have more eggs in one basket, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cake haters, here's a reality check. I grew mushrooms for over 30 years before making my first pf cake.  They're not bad and have a very high biological effeciency.  Done properly, they colonize fast and are great for proving strains.  There is no reason to skip cakes because they're a great way to experiment and learn the ropes, and without a pressure cooker, they're the only dependable way to get mushrooms.  I'm getting tired of the cake bashing that goes on in this forum, as if they somehow make a person a 'lesser' grower.  Take a look at fahtsters or roadkills cakes if you don't believe that.  There's always more than one way to skin a cat, and cakes are just one of them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6761017</next>\n<prev>6760870</prev>\n<first>6760796</first>\n<last>6761822</last>\n<when>1176054941</when>\n<utime>04/08/07 08:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
