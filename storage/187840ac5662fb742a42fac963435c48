My crappy light I mean 1w per square foot. This is not a plant and as long as you have more than 2 to 3 hours of light you are good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not just about initiating a pinset.&amp;nbsp; There was some very poor information in a popular book from 25 years ago and people keep parroting it as if it was handed down by Moses on Mt Sinai.&amp;nbsp; The author corrected his bad info in subsequent books, but nobody seems to buy those, or read them if they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By providing a 12/12 lighting schedule with bright, high frequency light such as natural daylight fluorescent or LED, you get a BETTER pinset, fatter and meatier caps, with shorter stems and more finished weight, plus healthier, more aggressive mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Light is NOT about which way is up. That information is provided to the mycelium by gravity.&amp;nbsp; The mushrooms use the light all the way to harvest, and scientifically, we probably don't know exactly &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; yet, but the fact remains they do.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants, but they still need light and benefit from a full day of light for &lt;i&gt;best results&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10576074</next>\n<prev>10575881</prev>\n<first>10570545</first>\n<last>10576302</last>\n<when>1246032969</when>\n<utime>06/26/09 07:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
