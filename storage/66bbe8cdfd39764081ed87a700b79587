If you can maintain upper nineties, that's fine, but you don't want complete saturation because evaporation from the casing layer or substrate is a major pinning trigger.  Very high humidity and lots of air exchange will give you the best pinsets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once growing, mushrooms do fine in the mid-ninety percent range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take exception to the 84F to 86F recommendation for colonization of the substrate.  I've found growth falls off at those temperatures, while molds and bacteria(if present) are encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7190252</next>\n<prev>7189431</prev>\n<first>7187887</first>\n<last>7193783</last>\n<when>1184728536</when>\n<utime>07/18/07 06:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
