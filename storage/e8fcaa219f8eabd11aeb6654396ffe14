You can also mix straw and coir together.  Don't add coffee to any casing.  The casing should be non-nutritious.  You can fruit uncased or case with peat/verm.   Adding another layer of coir would simply be adding another layer of substrate, which you would then have to wait to colonize, delaying your crop.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
