It has limited uses in mushroom cultivation and is greatly over used.  I don't use it when cloning except as a last ditch effort when nothing else has worked anyway.<br />Peroxide is great for killing cobweb mold on casing layers.<br />Some growers use peroxide when cloning, but this is self defeating.  It will kill bacteria on the culture, but in the process it injures the mycelium, making it take longer to recover and grow, thus hindering the cloning process.  Iodine works much better at killing bacteria, and doesn't harm the mycelium.<br />Sleepy, the fruiting body of a mycelial network is not mold.  Nor is mushroom mycelium mold.  Molds are imperfect fungi that do not produce fruits to reproduce, nor do they often have more than one nuclei per cell.   Mushroom mycelium begins life in the imperfect stage when a spore germinates, but becomes dikaryotic(multi nucleate) after mating with a compatible hyphae from another spore.  After the mating, each cell has two or more nuclei, which is required for fruitbody formation.<br />RR"}}
