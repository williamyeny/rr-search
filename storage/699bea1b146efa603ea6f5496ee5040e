Avoid misting while fruits are forming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice like this is what causes many grows to fail.&amp;nbsp; Misting is &lt;b&gt;required&lt;/b&gt; from birthing to the day of harvest.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grow best in 99% humidity, and that means rain if they're outdoors, or misting if growing indoors.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms pop up outdoors after a rain, so mist several times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I havent been misting much at all ... I've misted up into the air and let the fine water particles fall down into the FC because I read that direct misting may also cause bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's fine, but do it several times per day.&amp;nbsp; What kind of light is that?&amp;nbsp; The reason for a drop in humidity during the day is due to a temperature rise inside the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; If your temp goes up 20F degrees, your humidity will be cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ask about the light because I suspect it's producing heat, which is raising the temp in your tub.&amp;nbsp; If it's a CFL, raise it up a bit to make sure the temps don't rise inside.&amp;nbsp; If it's an incandescent, get rid of it and replace with a fluorescent.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8945192</next>\n<prev>8945037</prev>\n<first>8936396</first>\n<last>8945684</last>\n<when>1221691089</when>\n<utime>09/18/08 01:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
