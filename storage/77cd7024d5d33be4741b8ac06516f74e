It does not in any way, shape or form indicate you have a high humidity.  People in the desert can open a can of beer on a 120F day, and condensation will form on the side of the beer can.  Does this mean there's high humidity in the desert in July?  No, it means there's a temperature differential between the beer can and the outside air, just like your condensation indicates there's a temperature differential between inside and outside the terrarium.<br />Terrariums work best with holes for air exchange, several fannings out per day, three to five inches of well drained perlite with NO standing water, and no humidifier.  Ultrasonics put out too much moisture, and wicking filter types put out too little, and cool mists are somewhere in the middle, but work with greenhouses, not terrariums.<br />Do a few searches and read up.  All this has been covered many times before. <br />RR"}}
