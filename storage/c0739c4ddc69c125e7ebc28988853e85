Still other growers get multiple flushes from them, but with the isolated fruiting strains I use, I consider them a one flush wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to experiment all you want.&amp;nbsp; Consider what you learn here or in the DVD to be a starting point, and then take it from there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9786012</next>\n<prev>9785845</prev>\n<first>9785845</first>\n<last>9786462</last>\n<when>1234481475</when>\n<utime>02/13/09 01:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
