They are produced by the cell, not a change of state which will simply revert back to '<i>the form it had before, a live active bacterium and gets on with business.'</i>. If I had more time, I'd set up my video camera equipped microscope and film it.&nbsp; Perhaps in the future. . .<br />Hopefully this clears up any misunderstanding.<br />RR"}}
