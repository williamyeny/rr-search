Lion's mane is extremely intolerant of high CO2 levels, as are oysters.  Even with all the holes in the terrarium, CO2 built up, and when the fruit found the hole and moved outside, it firmed right up.  After this grow, I doubled and even tripled the number of holes in my terrariums.  That helped a lot, but fanning is still necessary.  It's a myth that CO2 will 'run out' since it's heavier than air.  It mixes with the air and stays put unless something forces it out.  The holes help a lot, but they don't replace fanning a few times per day.  They do however allow me to go to work or backpacking and leave them unattended for ten or so hours at a time.<br />If you're talking about the shiitake, they were birthed and dunked, the verm barrier washed off, and then returned to the jars to fruit, but with the lids off.  This allowed for water to be poured into the jars every second day, and then an hour or two later it would be poured back off.  Whether this tek would work for other species or not is subject to further experimentation.  It's just what I've learned to do with shiitake."}}
