That's cobweb mold.  3% peroxide sprayed full strength on cobweb will melt it on contact.   After spraying with peroxide, leave it open to the air with increased air exchange.  Stale, still air leads to cobweb, so up your air exchange.   You might need to make a second application of peroxide the next day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6140401</next>\n<prev>6138363</prev>\n<first>6137973</first>\n<last>6146530</last>\n<when>1160145138</when>\n<utime>10/06/06 05:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
