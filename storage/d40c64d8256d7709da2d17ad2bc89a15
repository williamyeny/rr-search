{"key":"post-6492244","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6492244</id>\n<content>Back in 1971 I was picking wild cubensis mushrooms in east Texas and had the same idea.  I brought home several cow pies with 'mushroom roots' and buried them around the edges of my compost pile outdoors.  It worked and grew mushrooms.  That was my first experience growing and I've never looked back.  I now know those &lt;i&gt;mushroom roots&lt;/i&gt; were actually rhizomorphic mycelium, but I certainly didn't know that back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't do that indoors though or the manure will turn green on you.  Do it outside and you'll very likely get good results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6492262</next>\n<prev>6492237</prev>\n<first>6492203</first>\n<last>6493586</last>\n<when>1169661831</when>\n<utime>01/24/07 08:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
