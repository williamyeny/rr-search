A glovebox does not need to be sterile at all. Wash it with soap and water.  Some guys use a bit of bleach in the wash water.  If I've worked with contaminated cultures on the previous use, I also use bleach.  Otherwise, I just use soap and water and leave the floor a bit damp.  This will cause any contaminants that land there to stay there. Just cut your arm holes in the side and have a lid on, but you don't need to tape around the lid if you're using a clear rubbermaid type container.  Wear latex gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pull your arm out to flame the needle or leave it in, your choice.  I flame on the outside because it keeps things cooler inside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5903086</next>\n<prev>5902841</prev>\n<first>5902841</first>\n<last>5904358</last>\n<when>1153969120</when>\n<utime>07/27/06 05:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
