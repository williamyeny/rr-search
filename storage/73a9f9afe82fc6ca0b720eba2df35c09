{"key":"post-5843920","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5843920</id>\n<content>You want your petri dishes off the bottom when you open them.  Jars are tall enough not to matter.  For petris, just keep them in a stack and only open the top one.  I only use soap and water in my gloveboxes and after cleaning, leave the floor damp.  This helps to hold down anything that might settle there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rack is a good idea too.  I use one in front of the flowhood when working with petris to get them into the middle of the flow, so I have laminar flow under the dishes as well as around and over them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5844271</next>\n<prev>5843604</prev>\n<first>5843012</first>\n<last>5844271</last>\n<when>1152581173</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 04:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
