It can sometimes take two weeks to see growth with the naked eye, especially if the spores are old. It should also be noted that tap water in some areas is not suitable for syringe making, but in other areas it's fine.  Chlorine is not harmful in the amounts found in tap water to mycelium, but it can be death to spores.  I would recommend distilled for that reason.<br />RR"}}
