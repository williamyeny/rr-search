Rinse, then drain well before placing three to five inches deep in the terrarium.  Place cakes on a jar lid or foil to keep them separated from the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drill a bunch of holes in the terrarium for air exchange for while you're at work.  I use a 1/4&quot; drill bit and drill at least 100 holes on all six sides of my terrariums.  More than that if it's a large one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6869867</prev>\n<first>6868394</first>\n<last>6869908</last>\n<when>1178253119</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 07:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
