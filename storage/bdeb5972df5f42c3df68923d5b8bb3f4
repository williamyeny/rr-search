{"key":"post-8547630","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8547630</id>\n<content>The entire design of the shotgun terrarium is to NOT use such mechanical devices that either dry out or flood your projects.&amp;nbsp; Despite what you'll read here and elsewhere, &lt;u&gt;there is no such thing as a fully automated terrarium&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The shotgun terrarium comes as close as you're going to get.&amp;nbsp; All you have to do is mist as required, and then fan your lid over the opening after you mist. It's extremely important that cakes and other substrates have a chance to dry out slightly between mistings/waterings, and the judgement call of when to mist needs to be made with your eyeballs, not a timer, and the misting needs to be done by hand. Don't fix what isn't broken. A good use for that coolmist is to shitcan the hoses, etc., and run it in your room 24/7 to raise ambient humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8547648</next>\n<prev>8547588</prev>\n<first>8547515</first>\n<last>8547648</last>\n<when>1214078248</when>\n<utime>06/21/08 10:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
