They begin to form stones within a couple weeks of germination.  You can then transfer the stones to new dishes, allow those to grow out, and inoculate grains.  This ensures you have a good sclerotia producing strain.  Once you do the above, simply do two or three g2g to get up to a truckload of mycelium within 30 days if you want it, and it's much faster than messing with silly lc's.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7021121</next>\n<prev>7020100</prev>\n<first>7020100</first>\n<last>7021121</last>\n<when>1181260269</when>\n<utime>06/08/07 02:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
