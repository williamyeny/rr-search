They line the stable floors with straw, then it makes it easier to rake, sweep or shovel the shit out into a pile outside.  Just get the stuff that's been out in the sun and rain for a few months.  Get your manure after a spell of hot, dry weather.  If you bring it home wet, it will mold.<br />RR"}}
