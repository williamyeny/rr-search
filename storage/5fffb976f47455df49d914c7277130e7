I just have a couple of 4&quot; holes cut for my arms to stick through.  I wear tyvek sleeves and latex gloves, but the thing is far from airtight.  All you need is still air and you'll get that even with a loose lid.  Of course, be sure to shut off all fans, central AC/heat, etc., an hour before doing any sterile work so the air in the general area can settle down.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6527894</next>\n<prev>6526811</prev>\n<first>6525772</first>\n<last>6527894</last>\n<when>1170546127</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 01:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
