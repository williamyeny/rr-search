Get something in the 20 to 25 psi range.  I'm assuming that parts are no longer available from the manufacturer?  You could also have them drill and tap a 1/8&quot; NPT hole and get a relief valve from AA.  They would then weld the original hole shut for you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6830037</next>\n<prev>6829915</prev>\n<first>6829915</first>\n<last>6830927</last>\n<when>1177479089</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 08:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
