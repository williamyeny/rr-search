{"key":"post-6055987","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6055987</id>\n<content>I use the 35% peroxide in my humidifiers to keep them clean.  I probably pour in a couple of tablespoons into the vics coolmist.  That would be the same as a small bottle of the 3% stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using 3% peroxide full strength on cobweb as it will melt on contact.  As hyphae already said, don't use it as preventative, but only to control outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6056007</next>\n<prev>6055358</prev>\n<first>6054736</first>\n<last>6056007</last>\n<when>1158132707</when>\n<utime>09/13/06 10:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
