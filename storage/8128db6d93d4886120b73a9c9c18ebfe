Use it at no more than 1 part chicken manure to 20 parts of the other substrate materials.  The reason I say that is coffee is pretty darned expensive to buy for a substrate.  If you drink coffee anyway, no problem, but otherwise there are other materials that work as well.  Coffee should be brewed before using.  You can brew up a pot of coffee, then use the liquid coffee to hydrate your rye or wbs, and save the spent grinds for your substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6710179</next>\n<prev>6710141</prev>\n<first>6710015</first>\n<last>6780937</last>\n<when>1174862682</when>\n<utime>03/26/07 01:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
