Geotrichum mycelium is white, so you wouldn't have seen it before birthing, but the air could well have stimulated it to begin sporulating.  If the spot grows or the pink looks like it's <i>above</i> the mycelium on the cake(indicating contaminant spores) as opposed to <i>staining within</i> the cake(indicating metabolites), it's time to toss it.<br />RR"}}
