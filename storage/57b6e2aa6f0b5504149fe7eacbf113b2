Four 1/8&quot; holes have the same area as a single 1/4&quot; hole.  I would be afraid that four 1/4&quot; holes would dry out your jars and/or encourage invitro pinning.  Remember, you want gas exchange in jars, not air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7153561</next>\n<prev>7153550</prev>\n<first>7153491</first>\n<last>7153647</last>\n<when>1184036515</when>\n<utime>07/10/07 06:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
