Other members from here who have switched to 6500K have all reported increases in growth, pin formation, and total weight at harvest.&amp;nbsp; This is now the standard, and it's being used by commercial growers for that reason.&amp;nbsp; One can argue from a point of ego to 'prove somebody wrong' simply because he says so, or one can argue from a point of doing multiple experiments on a daily basis and then freely sharing the results with others.&amp;nbsp; I chose the latter.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to all for the distraction from the troll above.&amp;nbsp; He wanted to get banned like he did last time for puppetry and trolling, and he got his wish. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13227234</next>\n<prev>13226990</prev>\n<first>13224293</first>\n<last>13227352</last>\n<when>1285099652</when>\n<utime>09/21/10 11:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
