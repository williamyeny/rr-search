{"key":"post-7361074","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7361074</id>\n<content>I recommend against pruning.  First of all, large mushrooms are less potent by weight than small mushrooms.  Don't pick your potent fruits to feed your unpotent ones.  By following proper initiation technique, your pinsets will be more even.  I'd suggest picking the larger fruits just before the veil tears, at which time the smaller ones will take off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17289776</next>\n<prev>7359689</prev>\n<first>7358763</first>\n<last>17289776</last>\n<when>1188742768</when>\n<utime>09/02/07 05:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
