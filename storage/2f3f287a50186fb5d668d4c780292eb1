It still works to do it that way.  What we've found however, is that pinsets and eventual yield can be increased by letting the substrate fully colonize in a high CO2 environment, and then let the casing layer colonize partially in a high CO2 environment, and then at the precise time, expose to fresh air, light, etc., all at once to trigger very nice flushes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7791907</next>\n<prev>7791776</prev>\n<first>7791776</first>\n<last>7799746</last>\n<when>1198428754</when>\n<utime>12/23/07 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
