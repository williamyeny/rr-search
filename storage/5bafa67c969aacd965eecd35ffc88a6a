{"key":"post-6687175","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6687175</id>\n<content>I live in Seattle where just about everyone has rhododendrons in their flowerbeds, and they're all over in the parks.&amp;nbsp; In fact, they're one of the indicator species for locating P. cyanescens, but that's a different topic. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; I just pick and dry the leaves, and use them at up to 10% the volume of the peat in the casing material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I used 1 tablespoon of Banrot per the several gallons I soaked the 10 cups of rye berries in overnight prior to PC'ing.&amp;nbsp; It's been awhile, so you might search some more and find the posts that I wrote when my memory was still fresh on it.&amp;nbsp;  I found those links in about 30 seconds by using the 'search posts' feature, then cliking on 'advanced mycology' and placing my username in the appropriate box.&amp;nbsp; You might find a few hits here in cultivation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recommend using chemicals to cover for sloppy technique though.&amp;nbsp; Proper attention to sterile technique when preparing jars, proper pasteurization, NOT sterilization of substrate and casing mixes, and proper air exchange will all but eliminate trich anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6687287</next>\n<prev>6686904</prev>\n<first>6686389</first>\n<last>6687287</last>\n<when>1174333223</when>\n<utime>03/19/07 10:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
