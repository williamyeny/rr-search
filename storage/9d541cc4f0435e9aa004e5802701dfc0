Nothing is going to grow in distilled water, not even the spores within the syringe.  Bacteria wouldn't grow either, so it's not necessary.  It sure won't help if the substrate you inject is exposed to bacteria.  The 1 or 2 ml per jar of solution won't have enough antibiotic to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentamicin sulphate has a place in agar work.  Some growers have added it to grains, but I would discourage the practice.  Not only is it expensive, costing about $5 to $10 for enough to do a 1 quart grain jar, but I'd worry about creating super strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7727371</next>\n<prev>7727255</prev>\n<first>7727255</first>\n<last>7728326</last>\n<when>1197024818</when>\n<utime>12/07/07 12:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
