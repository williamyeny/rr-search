As suggested above, search for my shotgun terrarium info.  It's a rubbermaid type tote with a hundred or so holes drilled into all six sides for air exchange.  5&quot; of well drained perlite will deliver mid 90 percent humidity and all the air exchange you need between manual fannings.  You can still use the wax paper to make sure it stays 100% right at the surface where primordia form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to filter air entering a terrarium.  The key is to exchange your air often, and quickly, to avoid drying out the air or substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7761264</next>\n<prev>7761208</prev>\n<first>7761161</first>\n<last>7785228</last>\n<when>1197735476</when>\n<utime>12/15/07 06:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
