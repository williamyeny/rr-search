It's due to a lot of iron in your water. There's so much iron in the soil around my cabin, if I drop a magnet on the ground, the dirt and pebbles stick to it. <br />I have the same thing with my well water and it's fine for cakes.&nbsp; If you're on well water, pm me and I'll give you the fix.&nbsp; I took care of the bad smell on my well.&nbsp; If it's tap water, can't help ya.<br />RR"}}
