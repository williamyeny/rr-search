Place the perlite in a strainer and let water run through it from the faucet.  When the perlite has been throughly rinsed, let drain for a minute or two, then dump into your terrarium.  Enough water will be stuck to the perlite to give 99% humidity for three weeks or so. Repeat this process after each flush or two. Standing water of any kind will actually lower humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5204089</next>\n<prev>5203945</prev>\n<first>5203875</first>\n<last>5237978</last>\n<when>1137808647</when>\n<utime>01/21/06 03:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
