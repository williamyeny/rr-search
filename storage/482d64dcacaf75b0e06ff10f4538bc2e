But when it comes time to inoculate, there's exploded grains all over the place. What is causing this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're supposed to wait until the pressure cooker cools for at least several hours.&amp;nbsp; If you remove the jars as soon as pressure drops, this is what happens. It's basic physics: The grains are at 250F when at pressure, and when the pressure &lt;i&gt;in the vessel&lt;/i&gt; drops to zero, the inside of the glass jars are still at or near 250F, which is why the moisture has to exit the grains very rapidly, resulting in bursting. I wait at least until I can remove the jars without any heat protection for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17390701</next>\n<prev>17389796</prev>\n<first>17382471</first>\n<last>17390701</last>\n<when>1355498952</when>\n<utime>12/14/12 05:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
