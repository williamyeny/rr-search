Lysol and/or alcohol are sanitizers, not sterilizers.  You can't transfer from the jar to the plastic without it getting contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to heat the closet.  Room temperature is fine.  In fact, with a light, you'll need to cool the closet to keep it from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of posts around here on stealth, so read up.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6355767</next>\n<prev>6355243</prev>\n<first>6355243</first>\n<last>6359060</last>\n<when>1165804653</when>\n<utime>12/11/06 04:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
