Peat based casing layers should be pasteurized, not sterilized.  It does no good to say something doesn't perform well if you don't follow proper procedure in making it.  As I've said many times, the commercial growers have invested millions of dollars into research on ways to maximize crops.  We can learn a great deal from them, and then expand on that knowledge.  Edible and medicinal mushrooms with few exceptions are exponentially harder to grow then cubensis, so learn from those who are already at the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing cubes can be looked at as a way to learn mycology and then move on, or it can be looked at as a way to get some cheap drugs.  Those who follow the latter are here today, freaked out by a trip and gone tomorrow.  That's why there is such a huge turnover on this and other boards.  Look at growing cubes as a way to 'learn the ropes' and then move to harder and more rewarding species.  When you do that, the small things such as casing layer composition become much more important to get just right.  Many species won't even fruit at all on a sterilized casing layer.  Cubes will fruit, but poorly compared to how they fruit on a properly balanced, pasteurized casing layer, applied over a properly balanced, pasteurized bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7834947</next>\n<prev>7834865</prev>\n<first>7832877</first>\n<last>12090397</last>\n<when>1199553745</when>\n<utime>01/05/08 07:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
