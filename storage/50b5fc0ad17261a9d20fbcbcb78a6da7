The heat also causes convective turbulence, again stirring the air. Nobody is counting molecules.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11323457</next>\n<prev>11323315</prev>\n<first>11319690</first>\n<last>11582391</last>\n<when>1256573358</when>\n<utime>10/26/09 07:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
