One forum or the other will get you the answer, but this is the place for contaminant questions.  It does look like water drops falling.  Make sure there's a drip shield if you're using a terrarium, and don't allow a temperature difference between inside and outside.  In other words, don't heat a terrarium.  They'll be ok as soon as they're totally cracker dry.  Pick now if you haven't already.  They're ready.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5767456</prev>\n<first>5767456</first>\n<last>5768744</last>\n<when>1150756890</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 01:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
