I wonder, if I put dye in the substrate and water, would there be any chance that the mushrooms would change color? I think it'd be pointless but cool, and would be usefull if you had different strains mixed together that looked the same, but you'd need to tell apart. Any thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about this for one second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If putting food coloring in the substrate worked, wouldn't mushrooms grown on brf cakes be tan, and wouldn't mushrooms grown on manure be dark brown?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium metabolizes its food.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't have a vascular system like roses to draw coloring up from the root system to the flower.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are as different from plants as a lizard is from an cactus.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13146373</next>\n<prev>13146253</prev>\n<first>13146175</first>\n<last>13147052</last>\n<when>1283616764</when>\n<utime>09/04/10 07:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
