I didn't think it was that low until I read that. I had the FC too close to my (dry) heater and I think it dried out right away. I think my cakes are now dry as well. I say this because I dunked a cake that was taking it's sweet time colonizing. I pulled it out&amp;nbsp; of the dunk and man it had some wieght on it. I picked up my other cakes.. light, very light.. they are even smaller than my newly dunked cakes. I think people have used the term 'mummified' on these forums. Ah well. My question now is should I just harvest the little guys and dunk them again, or wait and see what turns up until they just stop pinning on their own? I now have a thermometer and hydrometer. I added more wet perelite and have been mising more. The RH is constnatly between 95%-99% and the temp is nearly always 75 F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will not be any condensation on the sides of a shotgun terrarium. Condensation only means you have a temperature differential between the two sides, and you're unlikely to have a temperature differential with all the holes in place.&amp;nbsp; In addition, low humidity will not cause aborts.&amp;nbsp; Low humidity will cause scaling on the caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, you forgot to mist your cakes a few times daily after placing in the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; Since fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, you got a really nice pinset, but then they ran out of water in the cakes and either went dormant or aborted.&amp;nbsp; Re-dunk all your cakes, even those with pins for 12 hours, and then don't forget to mist.&amp;nbsp; The air exchange a shotgun terrarium provides will give you a nice pinset, but it will also dry out the cakes, thus misting is extremely important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't pick aborts until you pick the rest of the mature flush.&amp;nbsp; Disturbing the surface of the substrate around aborts will damage the growing pins.&amp;nbsp; Before anyone repeats the horrible mantra that aborts will rot and ruin the cake, they won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good move getting a humidifier.&amp;nbsp; Anytime you need to run heat in your house, you should also run a humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11808678</next>\n<prev>11808672</prev>\n<first>11788760</first>\n<last>13824685</last>\n<when>1263246199</when>\n<utime>01/11/10 11:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
