{"key":"post-6862800","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6862800</id>\n<content>I've posted many times that spawn bags should be fully inflated in order to work properly.  If they're rolled up, you don't have a plenum of air inside for the mycelium to breathe while colonizing.  You want to inflate the bags in front of a flowhood, and then while full of air, seal them.  This provides a plenum of air in the top of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A secondary method to use if you've already sealed the bag without air in the top is to hang it from a closet shelf so the force of the grains or substrate pulls the bag open, drawing air into the top through the filter.  This method is inferior to inflating with a laminar flow hood, but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6862732</prev>\n<first>6861384</first>\n<last>6862800</last>\n<when>1178131077</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 09:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
