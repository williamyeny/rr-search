A horse and a donkey can mate and produce a mule. But, all mules are infertile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF do horses and donkeys(mammals) have to do with fungi?  Don't make shit up.  &lt;i&gt;Cross-species&lt;/i&gt; hybrids have been successfully completed with mushrooms.  Crossing strains of the same species is easy.  Search mine and workman's posts for more details.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7604121</next>\n<prev>7604073</prev>\n<first>7603198</first>\n<last>7606411</last>\n<when>1194400495</when>\n<utime>11/07/07 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
