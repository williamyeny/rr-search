{"key":"post-7785185","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7785185</id>\n<content>What you're seeing is the effects of multi-spore inoculation.  Often, several strains develop that are not compatible with each other, thus they don't form into a single organism via anastomosis. Therefore, more than one strain is fruiting on the same substrate. If you clone that big ol' choad, future flushes will have all choads, but whether you'll get enough of them to matter remains to be seen.  I'd clone it, and then after you eat the thing, you'll know if it's a strain you want to keep or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7785290</next>\n<prev>7785059</prev>\n<first>7784457</first>\n<last>7789718</last>\n<when>1198260800</when>\n<utime>12/21/07 08:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
