{"key":"post-6177909","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6177909</id>\n<content>I have a huge cardboard box of horse manure sitting in the living room.(yes, mrs rabbit is very tolerant)  There is absolutely zero smell if it's been field aged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily tell the aged kernels from the fresh ones, even in the rain.  You can bring it home wet, as long as you pasteurize and use right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For straw, add one cup of hydrated lime to each ten gallons of 140F to 160F pasteurization water.  This will pasteurize your straw in a ph solution of 10 to 11.  Drain after pasteurization, but don't rinse.  As the mycelium colonizes the straw, the ph will drop.  This high ph at the start helps to ward off the green molds, which seem to consider straw their favorite food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6177546</prev>\n<first>6177450</first>\n<last>6177909</last>\n<when>1161098813</when>\n<utime>10/17/06 06:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
