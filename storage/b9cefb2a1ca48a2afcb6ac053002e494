Test yours soon so you can return for credit if it's one of the bad ones.  I think hippiechick has a Taylor unit that works.  You might search using her name and Taylor to see if you can find a model number.  I prefer the mechanical hygrometers because you can calibrate them for 99%, making them extremely accurate at high humidities.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5734668</next>\n<prev>5732594</prev>\n<first>5732557</first>\n<last>5734668</last>\n<when>1149917043</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 08:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
