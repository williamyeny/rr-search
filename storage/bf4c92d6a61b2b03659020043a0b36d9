I don't isolate just one strain, because it could easily be a crappy fruiting strain.  I try to snag all of them because I'm greedy.  That way I can fruit out each and every one to find the best performers.  I just can't imagine having that many glass dishes around.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6847584</next>\n<prev>6846655</prev>\n<first>6843467</first>\n<last>6847584</last>\n<when>1177812017</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 05:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
