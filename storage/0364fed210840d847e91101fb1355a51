I use my left over coffee from breakfast, mixed 50/50 with tap water to hydrate both rye berries and rye grass seed. Don't forget to put a pinch of gypsum in each jar.  Put a solid, non filtered lid on the jar and shake it up well.  Allow to sit overnight, then replace with a filtered lid and pressure cook for an hour at 15 PSI.<br />Also, I've had much better success with sclerotia forming species by using rye berries, rather than rye grass seed.<br />RR"}}
