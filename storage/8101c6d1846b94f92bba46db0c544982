If it's really wet in there and condensation forms on the wax paper, it will begin to rot the mushrooms where it touches.  It looks like all your damage is on the top where the paper was, so that sounds likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really see no benefit for wax paper in a tub where your humidity is already really high.  Wax paper does the best job in a mini greenhouse where the humidity is kept in the 80% range.  I've even fruited on an open shelf in my bedroom by simply covering the tray with wax paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remove the wax paper and allow things to dry out a bit.  I'll bet they'll be ok.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5745972</next>\n<prev>5745943</prev>\n<first>5745881</first>\n<last>5775810</last>\n<when>1150230154</when>\n<utime>06/13/06 11:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
