They don't make electronic pc's that I know of.  Electronic implies transistors, which aren't needed to sterilize grains.  Electric pc's are great, but you need them on an isolated, dedicated outlet that doesn't supply power to anything else in your house.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6886608</next>\n<prev>6886417</prev>\n<first>6886209</first>\n<last>6886834</last>\n<when>1178592573</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 05:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
