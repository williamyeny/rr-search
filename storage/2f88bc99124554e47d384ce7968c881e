In fact, for many years I've kept them stuffed into any spot in my mini-greenhouse that tends to collect drips of water. Change them out once a week or so, and keep them fairly well squeezed of excess moisture so that what's in the paper towel can evaporate back out.  You can even press damp paper towels against the back and/or sides of the FC to give more surface area.  Clean cloth towels can also be used, and simply tossed into the washing machine once a week.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7968148</prev>\n<first>7966614</first>\n<last>7968173</last>\n<when>1201974930</when>\n<utime>02/02/08 07:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
