The mycelium has already gone from vegetative to fruiting stage, so the casing layer would just be in the way.  Dunk the substate after picking instead of putting a casing layer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good idea to let the substrate sit for 4 to 7 days after picking a flush to dry out a bit and 'rest' before dunking.  This will bring the next flush faster.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>21169942</next>\n<prev>6716181</prev>\n<first>6716181</first>\n<last>21170032</last>\n<when>1175017020</when>\n<utime>03/27/07 08:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
