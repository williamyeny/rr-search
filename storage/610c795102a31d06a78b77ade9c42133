I use steel tie wire for that purpose.&amp;nbsp; Obviously you can't use the insert if you tie the hose up to the lid.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14242791</next>\n<prev>14242697</prev>\n<first>14051768</first>\n<last>14410368</last>\n<when>1302042139</when>\n<utime>04/06/11 01:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
