Other than that, don't do anything different.  They're not as cold temperature tolerant as cubes, so try to keep fruiting conditions in the 75F to 85F range.  They usually take a few days to a week longer to pin than cubes as well. Shotgun terrarium will work fine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't like them anymore.  The trip always seemed a bit on the dark side, not pleasant at all in my experience.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7852965</next>\n<prev>7852764</prev>\n<first>7847645</first>\n<last>7853219</last>\n<when>1199896430</when>\n<utime>01/09/08 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
