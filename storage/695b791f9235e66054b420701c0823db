Remove foil immediately after sterilization. Inoculate and place on an open shelf, not a sealed stale-air tub.  <br />1/2 pint jars should fully colonize in two to three weeks at normal room temperature.  Don't turn them upside down because it disturbs the vermiculite filter and can allow contaminants into your jars.<br />RR"}}
