Isolate your wanted sub-strain. Grow your mushrooms. take a print from a healthy strong mushroom, start over. If everything is right, when agar is knocked up with your chosen mushrooms spores, you swhould have one section of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, that's not right at all.  When spores are used, many strains and isolates will develop.  In other words, if you fruit an isolated strain, the spores that fall, will NOT be an isolated strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've written pages and pages on how to isolate strains.  Search should reveal all you want to know.  There's also a strain isolation tek on my dvd if you learn easier by seeing it done.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7909960</next>\n<prev>7909489</prev>\n<first>7895760</first>\n<last>8016395</last>\n<when>1200949432</when>\n<utime>01/21/08 11:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
