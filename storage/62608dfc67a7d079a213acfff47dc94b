Alcohol doesn't sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/212212163-Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_004a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-008/212212163-thumb_Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_004a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>22357807</next>\n<prev>22357787</prev>\n<first>22355970</first>\n<last>22364483</last>\n<when>1444481042</when>\n<utime>10/10/15 03:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
