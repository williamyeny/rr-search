Depending on your ppm monitor our buckets have read <b>anywhere from 3000-5000 ppms of consistent co2 flow upon activation</b>. However, as stated in question one, our product is not meant to be measured in ppms, it's meant to be distributed directly to your plants and measured by the improved health and quality of your garden.<br />Smells like bullshit, thinking of high exhaust fans etc. at grow setup.</blockquote><br />I call bullshit too.&nbsp; I stuck my CO2 detector into a single bag of shiitake spawn and it read over 15,000 PPM.&nbsp; It appears they stuck one into a bucket of their stuff and got 3000.&nbsp; That isn't going to be enough to do much good in a grow area.<br />From my experience growing hydro back in the stone age, air exchange is necessary to prevent moldy buds.&nbsp; I wouldn't mess with it.<br />RR"}}
