I've seen some nice flushes on substrates with trichoderma. However, when it shows up prior to first flush, it usually means the spawn was contaminated prior to casing.  In these cases, there's not much to do other than bury it outside and see if nature can sort things out.  If it's the wrong time of year, you're probably screwed.  Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend immediately tossing out contaminated substrates because to allow them to sporulate billions of green mold spores all over your growing area, and in fact your whole house, compromises future grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7691137</next>\n<prev>7690990</prev>\n<first>7690969</first>\n<last>7695490</last>\n<when>1196289664</when>\n<utime>11/29/07 12:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
