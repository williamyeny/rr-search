{"key":"post-5567109","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5567109</id>\n<content>I dunk large bulk substrates between flushes by placing the rubbermaid tub in the bathtub with the drain open.  Let the faucet run until it fills up the rubbermaid and it runs over and down the drain.  Turn the water down so it barely runs to keep some circulation going for two hours or so. 24 hours is way too long for a bulk substrate.  Hold your substrate down with dumbells or anything heavy.   The running water prevents contaminants form building up during the dunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the dunk, the substrate will still be smaller.  The mycelium actually feeds on the substrate, so as it eats, the sub shrinks.  There is no problem having a gap around the edges.  Sometimes, your best fruits will come from there.  I used to fill in the gaps with casing material, but no longer do.  I really didn't see much benefit to it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5566981</prev>\n<first>5566981</first>\n<last>5567109</last>\n<when>1146254753</when>\n<utime>04/28/06 11:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
