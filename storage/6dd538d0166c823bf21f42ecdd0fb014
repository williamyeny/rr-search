That is flat out wrong.  The state of growing mushrooms has progressed way past what was thought 25 years ago.  Furthermore, the incorrect information presented 25 years ago said that 86F was an optimal SUBSTRATE temperature, not air temperature.  Since there is up to a ten degree increase in substrate temp over air temp, based on those 25 year old figures, you should colonize at no more than 76F ambient air temperature.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, maximum mycelium growth occurs at a &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;substrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; temperature of 80F to 82F, with a drop off in colonization speed above that.  Anyway, this has all been covered to death already, so there's no need to repeat it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7977366</next>\n<prev>7977293</prev>\n<first>7977049</first>\n<last>7984748</last>\n<when>1202148743</when>\n<utime>02/04/08 08:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
