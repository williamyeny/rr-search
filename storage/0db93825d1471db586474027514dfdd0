That's why we roll in dry verm.  The verm soaks up the water when you mist, and then slowly supplies it to the mycelium.  A small substrate such as a cake will dry out very fast if you don't stay right on top of moisture control.  As said, I recommend perlite humidification, especially for cakes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7719401</next>\n<prev>7719336</prev>\n<first>7718837</first>\n<last>7836978</last>\n<when>1196880627</when>\n<utime>12/05/07 08:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
