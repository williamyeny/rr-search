Keep the log and the ground around it damp, but not soaking wet.  Put it somewhere in the shade, and it will probably fruit this fall.  If you want faster performance, you can fruit shiitake from substrate blocks indoors, but it's much more labor intensive.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6733175</next>\n<prev>6733126</prev>\n<first>6731388</first>\n<last>6734714</last>\n<when>1175398269</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 06:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
