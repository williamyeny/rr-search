If you grew your mycelium out in a pf jar, you birth your &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt;, then if desired you can case it with peat/verm.  However, I recommend fruiting pf cakes as cakes.  Dunk and roll works great, especially on your first few grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7088474</prev>\n<first>7088429</first>\n<last>7088502</last>\n<when>1182735951</when>\n<utime>06/25/07 04:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
