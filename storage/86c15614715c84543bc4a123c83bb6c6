Here's a link that explains it further. <a href=\"http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/envirohort/articles/misc/sphagnum.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.ext.vt.edu/department<wbr>s/envirohort/articles/misc/sphagn<wbr>um.html</a><br />The calcium carbonate is used to raise the pH.  I prefer hydrated lime because it goes to work right away when you need it.  We don't lime for the mushroom mycelium, because it actually <i>prefers</i> a slightly acid pH.  We lime because contaminant molds <i>require</i> a low ph, so by making it 7 or above, the casing layer favors mushroom mycelium over molds.   I'd suggest a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  That will get you into the ballpark without danger of making the casing too sweet.<br />RR"}}
