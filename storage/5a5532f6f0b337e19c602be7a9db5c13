Slowly turned hear up til steam came out.&amp;nbsp;  Waited 10 minutes then put on weight.&amp;nbsp;  Weight started shaking so I turned heat down.&amp;nbsp; Heat is barely on but weight is still shaking fairly fast but steady.&amp;nbsp;  This means it's at 15psi even though the heat is low correct? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cook for 60 to 90 minute. After wweight starts to rock as well right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the stove setting more next time.&amp;nbsp; Try to have the rocker rattle as little as possible.&amp;nbsp; You did the right thing leaving the weight off for the first few minutes to evacuate the air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19671971</next>\n<prev>19671232</prev>\n<first>19670420</first>\n<last>19674954</last>\n<when>1394386468</when>\n<utime>03/09/14 08:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
