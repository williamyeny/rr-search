Microwave safe, doesn't mean 'metal to plastic contact in a PC' safe.&lt;br /&gt;2. Even the experts sometimes give bad information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACT: Steam at 121C isn't hot enough to melt pp5 containers.&amp;nbsp; Either you bought falsely labeled shit or you're doing something else stupid.&amp;nbsp; Don't blame&amp;nbsp; experienced growers who have never melted plastic in their sterilizers for your fuckups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've posted over and over and over again that you can't have plastic touching the sides of a pressure cooker IF you're using a gas stove.&amp;nbsp; The reason is that the flame curls around and up the sides.&amp;nbsp; This raises the temperature on the sides of the PC during the warm-up period to well above the temperature it will be after steam is produced.&amp;nbsp; This doesn't happen with electric stoves, only gas.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that aluminum foil, one of the most &lt;b&gt;heat conductive&lt;/b&gt; materials in the world would suddenly become an &lt;b&gt;'insulator'&lt;/b&gt; simply because some idiot wrote a 'tek' and called it such is just dumb.&amp;nbsp; It's even dumber to blame others for your mistake because you think aluminum is an insulator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I'm certain no more than 2 weeks will pass before someone else will melt their shit trying to follow a stupid 'tek' and blame others yet again.&amp;nbsp; Use glass jars and proper filters to allow for shaking with grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm seriously thinking of censoring all these stupid teks noobs write by pulling an idea out of their ass and then pretending like it's proved method.&amp;nbsp; All they do is screw up other noobs who follow that instead of something which actually works.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19495267</next>\n<prev>19495097</prev>\n<first>19484780</first>\n<last>19504713</last>\n<when>1391090466</when>\n<utime>01/30/14 04:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
