They keep getting the bad advice that if you can see your mushrooms they have enough light, or that a few minutes of dim light is all they need, so they look elsewhere for the problem, and keep trying to adjust substrate, moisture, misting, casing, and everything else but lighting.<br />For those of you who have a project that 'just won't pin' try switching to natural daylight fluorescent and watch them take off.<br />RR"}}
