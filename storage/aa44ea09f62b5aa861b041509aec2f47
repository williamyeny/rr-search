Personally, I hate glass petri dishes.  Wait until you have several hundred going at once.  You'll have a ton of cash invested, then when you accidentally knock a stack over, half of them break.  They're also heavy to pick up when inoculating and you need to lift a stack of ten.  That causes them to slip out of your gloved hands.  They're a pain in the ass to clean up and re-PC, while the sterile plastic dishes can be had for 5 cents each here <a href=\"http://www.cenmed.com/showDetails.asp?item=6141&amp;mainCat=LS&amp;category=565&amp;pagename=searchresults.asp.\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cenmed.com/showDetails.asp?it...rchresults.asp.</a>  I seriously doubt you can wash and re-PC a glass dish for 5 cents.  You probably only got the bottoms because the other guy already broke all the lids."}}
