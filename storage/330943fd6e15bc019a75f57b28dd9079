I noticed this a few years ago and stopped doing it.  If you're using a terrarium, use well drained perlite for humidity.  For a mini greenhouse, put the unit inside the fruiting area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the vics coolmists, the V shaped nozzle that spins in the water is detachable.  Simply prevent the disk from turning, and rotate the nozzle half a turn and it will separate.  It might have become clogged up inside where the rifling is, when you cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7621299</next>\n<prev>7621092</prev>\n<first>7620618</first>\n<last>7621299</last>\n<when>1194791108</when>\n<utime>11/11/07 04:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
