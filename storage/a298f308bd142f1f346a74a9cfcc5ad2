Grains are cheap, but time, effort and spores are not.  Next time, wash the wbs very well before loading your jars.  Put the wbs in a large pot and fill it with water.  Stir it around, then dump the water out while holding the wbs back.  All that dust and crap that makes the seed sticky will wash out that way.  Repeat the process three or four times until the water you pour off is clear.  I add gypsum to the seeds at the rate of one tablespoon to ten cups of wbs or rye, and it's not even necessary to shake the jars while warm.  Sometimes I leave them in the PC overnight or all day while I'm gone to work.  They're never hard to shake or break up if you'll prepare them as above.<br />RR"}}
