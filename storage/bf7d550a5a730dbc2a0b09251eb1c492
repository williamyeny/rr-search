The rhizomorphs definitely aren't Dactylium(cobweb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb mold will be aerial and fuzzy, almost looking like the dust you find under your bed. It will also literally melt before your eyes if you spray it with 3% peroxide, so you can test spray a small portion if you want to find out for sure.  Remember though, 3% is the concentration it comes from the store if you live in the US, so you won't want to dilute it any.  Don't spray any of the ropey mycelium because that's definitely not cobweb.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6637297</next>\n<prev>6637222</prev>\n<first>6637222</first>\n<last>27512737</last>\n<when>1173119498</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 08:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
