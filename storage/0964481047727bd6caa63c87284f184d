Seattle is a mushroom growers paradise.  It has one of the best climates in the entire world for mushroom cultivation.  You rarely need heat or AC.  When we need AC such as NOW, it's usually only for a couple of days at a time.  I havn't heated my home in winter for the last five years.  There is no need.  The most that is needed is a small space heater in the room you incubate jars during January through March, but that's it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5982447</next>\n<prev>5981162</prev>\n<first>5979789</first>\n<last>5982447</last>\n<when>1156094953</when>\n<utime>08/20/06 08:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
