I like to poor mine that hot it seems to give me very high low contam rate . The steam and heat kills contams let in when pouring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I see one of these threads, I hold my breath hoping someone won't repeat that bad info.&amp;nbsp; Don't turn petri dishes upside down.&amp;nbsp; The moisture will collect on the lid, and then flood the mycelium when you turn it right side up.&amp;nbsp; In addition, moisture will fall out of the agar by gravity, compounding the problem.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is to wait to pour until the agar has cooled off enough to pour without heat protection for your latex gloved hands.&amp;nbsp; Pouring the agar hot does not kill contams let in while pouring.&amp;nbsp; If anything, the excess heat draws in contamination as the agar cools.&amp;nbsp; The solution is proper sterile procedure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13174121</next>\n<prev>13172696</prev>\n<first>13170796</first>\n<last>13219191</last>\n<when>1284092566</when>\n<utime>09/10/10 07:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
