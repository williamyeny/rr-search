If necessary, heat the room it's in to 70F, but don't heat the chamber itself. The temperature differential causes all your humidity to stick to the sides of the terrarium in the form of condensation instead of being suspended in the air as humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may or may not be the problem with your pinsets, but fix that before you do anything else.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6251199</next>\n<prev>6251010</prev>\n<first>6251010</first>\n<last>6251532</last>\n<when>1162780986</when>\n<utime>11/06/06 04:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
