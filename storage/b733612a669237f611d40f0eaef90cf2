Secondly, a temperature drop is not necessary.  Many growers in areas without air conditioning including my own, have found that cubes will fruit just fine in 90+ degree temperatures.  In fact, you can fruit in temperatures that would turn a &lt;i&gt;colonizing&lt;/i&gt; substrate into a bacterial blob.  I strongly disagree that a temperature drop is required for fruiting.  75f may help to get those massive pinsets that cover every square inch of the casing surface, but at 90f you'll get plenty of fruits and the ones you do get will grow much larger.  I doubt total yield is affected at all, so don't sweat it, you'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>26999681</next>\n<prev>5915096</prev>\n<first>5673889</first>\n<last>26999797</last>\n<when>1154294163</when>\n<utime>07/31/06 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
