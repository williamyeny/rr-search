Gypsum helps to prevent swings in either direction.  The ability to prevent clumping is why we use a small amount in grain jars.  I'm sure it's a side benefit in substrates and casings as well.  The other benefit of gypsum is to supply calcium and sulfur, which are both essential for good fruit body formation.  Some substrates seem to have enough of both to develop great fruits without it, but it's still there for the pH stability.  I pay just over $3 for a 25 pound bag which goes a long way, so there's no reason not to use it.<br />RR"}}
