It could take years of trying before finding a strain that will outperform what's available.  I've made dozens of isolates from spores of my best fruits, and hardly any have fruited at all, and none have fruited as well as my commercial strains.  With enough time, money and patience, it's very possible, but understand the numbers are against you with shiitake, where with cubes, it's rare to get a non-fruiting strain from multispore inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7440007</next>\n<prev>7439966</prev>\n<first>7439429</first>\n<last>7440007</last>\n<when>1190478283</when>\n<utime>09/22/07 07:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
