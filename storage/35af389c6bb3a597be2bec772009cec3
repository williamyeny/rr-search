{"key":"post-6637004","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6637004</id>\n<content>Incorrect.&amp;nbsp; The best way to learn is to stop pretending you know it all and listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the place to discuss strains of cubensis.&amp;nbsp; The topic is so irrelevant that a special thread in cultivation had to be made to keep the repeated discussions from cluttering up the forum.&amp;nbsp; In short, there is no comparison to strains of hemp with 'strains' of mushrooms of which there are millions that can be isolated from a single print.&amp;nbsp; The silly name on a print or syringe is just that:&amp;nbsp; A silly name.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom spores travel on the winds worldwide and there's little difference between 'strains' that show up on a consistant basis.&amp;nbsp; A 'strain' is created when to compatible hyphae meet and exchange genetic information, which results in polynucleate mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fuzz on the base of your stems is mycelium and is perfectly normal.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the whole fruiting body of a mushroom is composed of mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason for mushrooms not to get wet.&amp;nbsp; They grow during the rainy season in nature so getting wet is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have additional questions concerning contamination, this is the place for it, but don't be rude.&amp;nbsp; Your original answer that the 'fuzz' is mycelium was correct, but you took it wrong.&amp;nbsp; Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be nice people, and that's not just a suggestion. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6637016</next>\n<prev>6636988</prev>\n<first>6634679</first>\n<last>6639686</last>\n<when>1173111419</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 06:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
