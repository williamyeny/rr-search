We document communication after the order, timely shipping, quality of packaging, and quality of product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some vendors you'll see online who have proved to be so bad in the past, they'll never be sponsors here, due to that reputation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14055120</next>\n<prev>14054739</prev>\n<first>14054296</first>\n<last>14062032</last>\n<when>1299099505</when>\n<utime>03/02/11 10:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
