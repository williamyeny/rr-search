RTV silicone is designed for much hotter temps than found in a pressure cooker and it doesn't cure properly, usually peeling off later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply use regular silicone, not the high temp RTV. Clear silicone is good for up to 300F, which is well below a pressure cooker temp. You could also put micropore tape over the inoculation holes and simply cover the wound with another piece of micropore tape after injecting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17865083</next>\n<prev>17855739</prev>\n<first>17855434</first>\n<last>17865869</last>\n<when>1361705813</when>\n<utime>02/24/13 01:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
