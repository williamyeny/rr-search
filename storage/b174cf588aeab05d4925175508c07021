The above actually represents five expansions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we say to make a maximum of three grain to grain transfers, it's to make sure the mycelium is still aggressive enough to colonize the bulk substrate and then fruit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10748309</next>\n<prev>10748293</prev>\n<first>10748255</first>\n<last>10748356</last>\n<when>1248708657</when>\n<utime>07/27/09 06:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
