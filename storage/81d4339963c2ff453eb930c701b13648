Bleach, then soap and water, then alc. Also, anytime that you do anything in open air or where a contam could get in, lysol the wholeeee area and the entryways, and the walls, and the air above head level. Also make sure you are pressure cooking correctly and all of that good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bad advice.&amp;nbsp; Simply wash out containers with soap and water and re-use.&amp;nbsp; They get sterilized during the next round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, soaking and simmering wild bird seed won't cut it.&amp;nbsp; You have to sterilize it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15170792</next>\n<prev>15159941</prev>\n<first>15146919</first>\n<last>15242491</last>\n<when>1317650518</when>\n<utime>10/03/11 05:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
