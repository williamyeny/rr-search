If the jar fully overtakes the mold, it 'might' fruit, but don't attempt to spawn to manure.  You'll need to fruit it as a cake or bury in your garden along with some manure.  If you choose to fruit it as a cake, I'd suggest building its own fruiting chamber and keeping it in a shady spot of your garage or yard.  Personally, I wouldn't keep a moldy cake.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5761664</prev>\n<first>5760855</first>\n<last>5761783</last>\n<when>1150599230</when>\n<utime>06/18/06 05:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
