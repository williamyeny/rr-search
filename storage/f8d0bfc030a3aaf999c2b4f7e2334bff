{"key":"post-5546994","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5546994</id>\n<content>Please don't ask why I carefully cultivate strains of Dactylium, otherwise known as cobweb mold.  It's the old 'know your enemy' thingie I suppose.  Anyway, here's a picture of cobweb for those of you who haven't seen it or know what it is yet. On the surface of a cake or casing, it will not be nearly as dense as it is on nutrient rich agar.  However, you can see it's grey, not snow white like mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb mold can easily be defeated by spraying the 3% peroxide available at drug and grocery stores full strength from the bottle right onto the mold.  Mushroom mycelium can survive the peroxide, but it's death to cobweb.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb is the only major contaminant I recommend trying to save a project from.  If the mold on your project is green, toss it out right away as soon as you discover it.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/577079997-Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-16/577079997-thumb_Cobweb-Dactylium.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5547031</next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>5546994</first>\n<last>20752542</last>\n<when>1145808716</when>\n<utime>04/23/06 07:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
