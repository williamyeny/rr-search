Incidentally, I've typed this many, many times, but taping over holes in a shotgun terrarium LOWERS humidity, not raises it. I live in a high elevation mountain desert and my ambient humidity in the summer runs around 15% and in the winter at -30F, all the moisture is squeezed out of the air.&nbsp; I have no trouble at all maintaining 90% and greater humidity in a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; When I first designed that system, I lived in Seattle and thought it probably needed 35% or so ambient humidity to keep up.&nbsp; However, since moving to the high desert mountains of eastern Washington, I have learned otherwise.<br />In fact, I am building a commercial mushroom farm up here that uses no humidifiers or other mechanical means.&nbsp; I spray gravel on the floor with water once every two days, and humidity stays in the upper 90s, even when it's 10% or less outdoors.<br />I strongly suspect you're either not misting properly, or you have a faulty hygrometer.<br />RR"}}
