You're casing with the same thing as your sub , just with more verm . Does that mean I can case my poo with a 70/30 verm. poo mix ? Same theory and principle . &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/confused.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:confused:&quot; title=&quot;:confused:&quot;/&gt;lol .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace,Love,Happiness and Harmony&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/heart.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:heart:&quot; title=&quot;:heart:&quot;/&gt; Hippie Chick&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mushroom2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot; title=&quot;:mushroom2:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always recommended peat/verm for casing.&amp;nbsp; It's just that so many people are 'set' on using coir, that I grew tired of always saying it sucks as a casing, rather than a substrate.&amp;nbsp; If it's mixed 60/40 or 70/30 verm-coir it will work, although not as well as a non-nutritious casing such as peat will.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who were around then, I was the first person to say coir is a substrate material and not well suited for casing unless massively diluted with vermiculite. Until then, everybody seemed to repeat the lie that coir has no 'nutes'. In fact, saying that coir is better suited as a substrate than a casing material led to me getting banned from one of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;other&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mushroom boards for being on a 'jihad' against coir and popcorn spawn. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6243263</next>\n<prev>6242751</prev>\n<first>6233880</first>\n<last>6248798</last>\n<when>1162572932</when>\n<utime>11/03/06 06:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
