{"key":"post-7143788","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7143788</id>\n<content>I haven't used an incubator in years.  I allow all jars to colonize at room temperature.  Pf jars are usually finished in ten days to two weeks.   Allow gas exchange and make sure you don't make them too wet. Any temperature of the substrate over 83F will slow down colonization, and the substrate is always a few degrees warmer than the surrounding air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7143448</prev>\n<first>7142419</first>\n<last>7143788</last>\n<when>1183865717</when>\n<utime>07/08/07 06:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
