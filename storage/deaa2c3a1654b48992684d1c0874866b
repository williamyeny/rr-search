However, every day some noob advises some other noob to use it and all they end up doing is ruining their project and wasting time.&nbsp; <br />I know of absolutely ZERO experienced growers who still use LC.&nbsp; It's far slower than spores and you don't know what you have until you use it a few weeks later, when you'd already been picking mushrooms if you followed proper procedure.<br />It's not an oversight that resulted in no LC tek being on \"Let's Grow Mushrooms\".<br />RR"}}
