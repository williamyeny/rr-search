I did try twisting and pulling one and I ripped a chunk out of the substrate as I had predicted. I would definitely rather have a stump than a hole in the substrate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct and there's lots of bad info in this thread.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms from some strains are barely attached to the substrate, and fruits often fall over when they get large.&amp;nbsp; If you have one of these strains, go ahead and pull them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, other strains will be firmly attached to the substrate.&amp;nbsp; If you twist and pull these you'll rip out a large chunk of substrate, and this wound is an open invitation for molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stems left over when cut close to the substrate do not rot(obviously because they're not vegetable-based garbage), nor do they invite mold since they're not uncolonized substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cutting will become outdated info at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; We sterilize 480 lbs of substrate daily for our mushroom farm and cut every mushroom we grow to supply several supermarkets and every single restaurant in the county.&amp;nbsp; We only pick by slicing fruits off at the base except for two strains of Agrocybe aegerita we grow which tend to fall over on their own.&amp;nbsp; For these, we pull.&amp;nbsp; For the cut ones, I've never once seen mold or bacteria start in the stump left over, and we're doing 3000 substrates monthly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16264548</next>\n<prev>16263641</prev>\n<first>16258699</first>\n<last>16267684</last>\n<when>1337647033</when>\n<utime>05/22/12 03:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
