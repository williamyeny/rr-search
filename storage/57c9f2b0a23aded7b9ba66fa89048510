Nowhere does it say 'laminar flow' and they say &lt;u&gt;'UP TO&lt;/u&gt; 99.99% effeciency', not 99.99% effeciency.  That 'up to' is the catch.  You need a laminar flow HEPA, not a furnace filter type HEPA, because it has to hold static pressure on the back side in order to achieve laminar flow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6824591</next>\n<prev>6824352</prev>\n<first>6824087</first>\n<last>6824591</last>\n<when>1177376871</when>\n<utime>04/24/07 04:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
