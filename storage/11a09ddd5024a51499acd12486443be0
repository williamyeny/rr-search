No filter means any contaminants in the air get to your substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's great that the vendor will replace it in the interest of relations, but you need to clean up your technique.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5944588</next>\n<prev>5943603</prev>\n<first>5824219</first>\n<last>5947846</last>\n<when>1155069355</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 11:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
