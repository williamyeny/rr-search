Is it possible to increase the nutrient content in a 24 hour soak? could creating a carb nutrient rich colloid benefit the cakes in any way, also adding small amount of peroxide to the solution helping sanitation and oxygen levels. any input is appreciated and if you cant tell i'm really new to this.&lt;br /&gt;,thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it's been done, without success.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium in the vegetative stage will consume the food required for fruiting.&amp;nbsp; Once fruiting starts, the mycelium feeds the fruits from stored reserves.&amp;nbsp; If you add carbs or other sugars after fruiting begins, they become food for competitor fungi such as molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20186564</next>\n<prev>20185212</prev>\n<first>20181151</first>\n<last>20190860</last>\n<when>1403751103</when>\n<utime>06/26/14 05:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
