They don't melt if you purchased real autoclavable bags.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you run a gas stove, keep the flame low.  The only reason I could see for bags melting is if a flame was wrapping around the edges and coming up the sides.   I use an electric stove so heat only comes from the bottom below the waterline, thus bags don't melt, touching the sides or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6582614</next>\n<prev>6582516</prev>\n<first>6582516</first>\n<last>6582614</last>\n<when>1171848997</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 03:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
