{"key":"post-6393432","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6393432</id>\n<content>I have a local source for yard waste compost and it's a great addition to substrates.  It works best if you mix it with some manure, and even the composted cow manure from nurseries works well mixed with the garden compost.  Add a small amount of bagged chicken manure from the nursery and you have a great substrate.  If it seems thick, cut it with a bit of vermiculite and/or coir.  You can also add perlite to bulk substrates to fluff them up.  The perlite holds air, which comes in handy in manure based substrates.  You can also throw in a few days worth of spent coffee grinds.   In other words, the more different things you add to your substrate, the better it will perform.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6392971</prev>\n<first>6392166</first>\n<last>6393432</last>\n<when>1166720116</when>\n<utime>12/21/06 06:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
