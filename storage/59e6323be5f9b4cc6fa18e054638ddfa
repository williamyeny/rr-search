{"key":"post-6773616","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6773616</id>\n<content>The fact that it shrank so much before first flush tells you it's too dry.  It's also not fully colonized, so should not have even been exposed to fruiting conditions.  Coir is a substrate.  If you were going to use it for a 'casing', it would be two parts verm, to one part coir.  There's a lot of bogus teks in the archives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunk it for twelve hours or so.  It will probably fruit eventually.  It's not overlayed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6773716</next>\n<prev>6773521</prev>\n<first>6770237</first>\n<last>6774480</last>\n<when>1176275059</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 10:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
