A fruiting chamber need not be sterile.  The simple fruiting chambers work best.  Mine is just some plastic wrapped around pvc pipe with a cool mist humidifier running.  It works like a charm.  If you're growing pf cakes and need 99% humidity, just use a rubbermade container with 2&quot; of damp perlite in the bottom and a few holes cut in the sides for constant air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5844375</prev>\n<first>5844083</first>\n<last>5844432</last>\n<when>1152588050</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 06:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
