Shiitake growers report up to a 30% increase in harvests when gypsum is added to the woodchip/sawdust substrate. Gypsum supplies calcium and sulfur, both essential nutrients in mushroom metabolism.  It's used in grains to prevent clumping, but it's used in substrate and casing mixes to supply valuable nutrients.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While cubensis is so easy to grow it can literally fruit off the pages of an old book, maximum yields and vigor will be achieved by following the lead of the highly competitive commercial mushroom industry, where something as simple as adding gypsum can mean the difference between profit and loss.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5956241</next>\n<prev>5955931</prev>\n<first>5955066</first>\n<last>5982777</last>\n<when>1155402266</when>\n<utime>08/12/06 08:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
