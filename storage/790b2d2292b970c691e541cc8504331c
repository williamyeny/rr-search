The mycelium only cares about A and B mating types, not the name somebody wrote on the syringe or print.  You may end up with separate zones of each 'strain' or you may end up with a cross, or somewhere in between, but it won't be a hybrid since they're the same species anyway.  Either way, it looks like not a half bad pinset you have started there. . .&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6862597</next>\n<prev>6862458</prev>\n<first>6862402</first>\n<last>6862597</last>\n<when>1178125475</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 08:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
