Wax paper can help hold the humidity high right near the substrate surface, but it's no replacement for casing because it doesn't supply water to the substrate below.<br />Wax paper will help primordia to form, and as the fruits grow it will keep the caps from cracking if greenhouse humidity is too low.  Be sure to replace it every day or two with a fresh sheet.<br />RR"}}
