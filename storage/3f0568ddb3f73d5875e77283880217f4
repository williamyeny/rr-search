When using coir/verm you're basically fruiting from your grains and counting on them as the nutrients. The coir and verm is basically just a water reservoir although they do provide some nutrients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, that is flat-out wrong.&amp;nbsp; Coir is the equal of horse manure for growing mushrooms, and the verm provides minerals. Together they're superior to manure. The grains are a source of food, but by far not the main one in a bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19630914</next>\n<prev>19630598</prev>\n<first>19630326</first>\n<last>19633129</last>\n<when>1393622469</when>\n<utime>02/28/14 11:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
