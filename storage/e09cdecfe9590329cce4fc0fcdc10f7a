By clicking that link, you'll get all the info you need and four short videos that show you everything to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I donate a lot of my time to local schools, teaching the kids how to grow oysters and shiitake mushrooms on brf cakes.&amp;nbsp; One of the best projects I've seen yet came from a 12 year old girl with down syndrome.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, if she can succeed growing edibles on brf cakes, anybody can. Nothing makes me think someone around here is a total idiot more than seeing them trash the brf tek as being &lt;i&gt;too complicated&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, it's the FASTEST way to go from spore syringe to fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hobby is not for the lazy.&amp;nbsp; If you'll get away from that mindset, you'll succeed.&amp;nbsp; Grains must be handled in a completely sterile environment and cased.&amp;nbsp; Uncased grains won't fruit.&amp;nbsp; The oven idea for sterile work is just plain dumb and was disproved many years ago.&amp;nbsp; I've even deleted the so-called 'tek' from the main site.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9825381</next>\n<prev>9825254</prev>\n<first>9618357</first>\n<last>9826366</last>\n<when>1235061211</when>\n<utime>02/19/09 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
