said:</strong><br />This will be a Brief description for newbies like myself who want to truly understand how an sgfc works and why..<br />A shotgun fruiting chamber is any container with multiple holes drilled on all 6 sides, the bottom is filled with damp perlite which maintains humidity through evaporation, they require misting and fanning everyday atleast twice a day.<br />The natural draft in a room is how a SGFC maintains its humidity the air blows through the holes in your chamber causing a vacuum and air is pulled into your perlite through the bottom<br /><a

style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/10-51/313986570-thumb_Shotgun_step_1.jpg\"></a><br />This air being pulled through the perlite carries with it tiny water molecules it picks up on the way through and deposits them in the atmosphere inside your tub creating an almost perfect humidity for your mycelium 24/7<br /><a

style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/10-51/313986596-thumb_sgfc_step_2.jpg\"></a><br />Mycelium Ingest O2 and expels CO2 forming a gas layer of CO2 in your terrarium<br /><a

style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/10-51/313986620-thumb_sgfc_step_3.jpg\"></a><br />Because CO2 is heavier then O2 it then settles at the lowest point in your terrarium <br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/10-51/313986640-sgfc_step_4.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/10-51/313986640-thumb_sgfc_step_4.jpg\"></a><br />This is why its important to fan your cakes 3+ times a day forced air pushes the CO2 cloud out of your chamber and allows the moisture rich fresh air to take over,it also helps the evaporation process work and drys excess moisture of the cakes after a misting(no standing water on cakes ever..!!)<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/10-51/313986660-sgfc_step_5.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/10-51/313986660-thumb_sgfc_step_5.jpg\"></a><br />I Hope this helps and though it was not covered it is important to mist your cakes the misting of your SGFC will also provide help replenishing the moisture your perlite loses in its daily functioning <br />Best of luck</blockquote><br />This is not correct.&nbsp; The physics of the shotgun terrarium are that evaporation causes a temperature drop, thus the air molecules are closer together.&nbsp; This results in higher pressure within the air spaces around the perlite.&nbsp; <br />The substrates and/or lights provide slight heating within the body of the terrarium.&nbsp; This results in relatively lower pressure.&nbsp; This low pressure area above the perlite(high pressure) results in airflow to balance the pressure.&nbsp; This in turn leads to more evaporation from the perlite, continuing the process.&nbsp; This is why a shotgun terrarium handles FAE automatically.<br />The CO2 does not settle to the bottom.&nbsp; In addition, the CO2 from mushrooms is mixed thoroughly into the O2, thus it travels out through the holes in the sides and top as part of the natural circulation.&nbsp; It doesn't enter the denser air within the perlite and spill out the bottom.<br />RR","title":"Re: How shotgun fruiting chamber works (animated
