spend.&nbsp; Also, 100,000 BTU won't touch a retort that size, as it would take forever to heat up.&nbsp; I built the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Wood-Fired-Steam-Boiler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">wood fired steam boiler</a> pictured below last year.&nbsp; We use it to sterilize up to 100 five pound supplemented sawdust substrate blocks daily, plus it provides steam to a heat exchanger in the intake air duct of our below ground <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Mountain-Mushroom-Farm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">mushroom farm</a>, to preheat the air 24/7 during the winter, and during the daytime all summer to provide a day/night temperature differential.<br />The first link above gives some construction pictures and text, but I apologize that the page isn't fully finished.&nbsp; We're into our busy construction season again, so it won't have all the pictures up until this winter when I have more time for computer stuff.&nbsp; The boiler operates at 1 to 1.5 psi which is enough to heat our farm and sterilize substrates.&nbsp; We use an 8 hour sterilization cycle in our autoclaves, which are made from 55 gallon drums.&nbsp; We have four of them now, like the one pictured below.&nbsp; There's a lot more pictures in my gallery if you want to take a stroll.<br />RR<br
