Light for growing mushrooms is a lot different than light growing marijuana. Marijuana needs light for photosynthesis. The light for mushrooms only tells them which direction to grow in.</blockquote><br />That is absolutely incorrect.<br />In addition, a few milliseconds of light will not trigger pinning.&nbsp; The fact is, cubensis will pin in total darkness, and that's probably what confused the guys who gave Paul that information.&nbsp; However, the pinset will be poor and the fruits misshaped. <br />Contrary to another facet of disinformation being passed around here, mycelium/mushrooms DO get energy from light.&nbsp; Many people think because mycelium doesn't conduct photosynthesis, that light is only for knowing 'which way is up', which is also incorrect.&nbsp; The force of gravity is what tells the mushrooms which way is 'up'.&nbsp; Mushrooms grow towards the light because they're deriving energy from it.<br />Mushrooms grown in bright, high frequency light will be meatier, have fatter caps, and thicker heavier stems.<br />RR","title":"Re: light
