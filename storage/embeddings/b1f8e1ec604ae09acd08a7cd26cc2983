too be a cheap alterniative to brown rice flour.<br />I understand also that rice bran is an additive that can be used for your coir<br />substrates. </blockquote><br />I'd strongly discourage using rice bran in a coir substrate unless you're going to sterilize and colonize the coir in a filter patch bag.&nbsp; Don't use rice bran, or any other bran or brf in any substrate that is going to colonize while exposed to air.<br />Being cheaper is only one reason to use rice bran.&nbsp; Brans are more nutritious than flours because the outer husk is left on when ground.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's the same product as brown rice flour.<br />Be wary of people who get all arrogant based on only one grow.&nbsp; I've used rice bran on thousands of grows over the years, and it's a great product.&nbsp; If you're growing from spores, ensure that the brand you buy isn't treated with fungicides.<br />A small amount of calcium carbonate such as they add to the horse feed supplement is fine.&nbsp; I doubt they add enough to effect the pH much.&nbsp; They're adding the calcium as a supplement for bone health in animals, but fungi also needs calcium, and mushrooms are one of our best sources of dietary calcium.&nbsp; It's the reason we use gypsum.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question; Rice
