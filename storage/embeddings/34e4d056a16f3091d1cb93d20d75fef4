/>im guessing air exchanges per hour is some standard term in production scale mushroom farming?</blockquote><br />Actually, it's a figure someone pulled out of his ass.&nbsp; Think of it this way: One substrate in a large grow room wouldn't need but one air exchange per week to stay within the maximum CO2 level.&nbsp; However, thousands of substrates stacked to the ceiling on full shelves might need one air exchange every 5 minutes to remain below 1000 ppm of CO2.<br />A complete air exchange means calculating the total cubic feet area of a room, and then getting a blower which can move that amount of air in one hour.&nbsp; Such would be 1 air exchange per hour.&nbsp; If you had a blower which could move ten times that amount, you could run it five minutes on/five minutes off to obtain 5 air exchanges per hour.&nbsp; However, the bottom line is to get a CO2 meter and adjust air exchange to remain within the limit of 1000 ppm.&nbsp; <br />I try to keep it below 600 ppm in my farm, but on hot days when the incoming air is less dense, that's hard to do even with my blower running 24/7.&nbsp; This winter when the incoming air is more dense, I'll have to plug my cycle timer back in.<br
