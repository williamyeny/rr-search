You could grow a small crop of MJ with all that fucking light.  Not necessary at all. </blockquote><br />Mind explaining yourself?  We get the best results growing mushrooms with fluorescent light because it's the correct color temperature.<br />Plants require much more light than mushrooms because they derive energy from the light source.  In addition, most mj growers switch to a redder light at fruiting time, not the high frequency 'blue' light we get from our fluorescents.  Perhaps you're confusing the Kelvin color temperature scale with intensity?  <br />My fluorescent fixture provides light to six shelves, each one eight feet long and three feet deep.  That's 144 square feet, thus less than 1 watt per square foot of shelf space. The foil helps to prevent the trays in the back from being shaded by those in front. I challenge the best mj grower in the world to try to grow plants under that.<br />Compact fluorescent bulbs work great as well for fruiting chambers and mini-greenhouses.  In addition, LED technology has progressed considerably in the last few years.  I'm sure it won't be long before LED fixtures are made with  controllers to adjust color temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Different light
