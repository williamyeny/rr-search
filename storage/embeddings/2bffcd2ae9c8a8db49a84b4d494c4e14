Most of the named 'strains' were simply named after the geological location the print was collected from, as if a man made line in the sand changes the genetics of biological creatures.  If a guy collects a print in Florida and names it treasure coast, and another guy collects a print in Georgia and names it hillbilly, are they really different?  Both grew in the same region, under the same weather conditions, and spores from both mix freely in the wind.  <br />It's the same with all the SE Asia 'strains' in circulation.  Lines on a map drawn by the British 50 years ago do not cause the mycelium that's been evolving for millions of years to suddenly morph into new strains, marketing considerations aside.  They're all Cubensis.  <br />There are distinct strains such as Penis Envy, various albinos and fruits that drop slightly different spore coloring, but the rest is marketing, not mycology and they all mix and match easily.  My point was that putting spores from several named 'strains' in the same substrate does not result in a hybrid, since there's no verifiable difference between them.<br />RR","title":"Re: 3 strains 1
