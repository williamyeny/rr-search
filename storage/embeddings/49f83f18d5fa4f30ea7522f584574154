exchange is very important during colonization.&nbsp; If nothing grew however, it didn't suffocate because there was no mycelium to consume the available O2.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>jolly.roger77 said:</strong><br />I think I'm going to opt for a pressure-cooker next time.&nbsp; From the minor research I've done here, it seems to have a higher success rate than regular stovetop steaming.&nbsp; Also, going to use micropore tape (if I can find it).&nbsp; Any insights here?</blockquote><br />Incorrect.&nbsp; Steaming is as effective as pressure cooking for the brf tek.&nbsp; Micropore tape is made by 3M and sold in drug stores.&nbsp; It's medical tape.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>jolly.roger77 said:</strong><br />But...just how safe is it to leave the lids uncovered during colonization?&nbsp; That's the one thing that bugs me most, the chances of some miniscule abhorrence getting into the substrate.&nbsp; However, I will definitely be shelving them instead of shutting them inside something.</blockquote><br />It sounds like you still haven't watched the videos linked to above.&nbsp; You're supposed to remove the foil as soon as you remove the jars from the sterilizer.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>jolly.roger77 said:</strong><br />I got one of those faux granite canning pots from Kmart, thought it was great for what I needed.&nbsp; Only problem is that I could not keep the steam contained within the pot.&nbsp; The jars still certainly got steamed but a lot of it was escaping.&nbsp; It was really something I could not keep from happening.</blockquote><br />This is a fine method, that is the correct kettle, and the steam is <i>supposed to escape</i>.&nbsp; If no steam is escaping, there is no steam surrounding your jars.&nbsp; In addition, the convection is a large part of the process.&nbsp; Again, watch the videos.&nbsp; It's demonstrated.<br />RR","title":"Re: Failure (or not)? *PLEASE
