prone to contamination.&nbsp; In addition, cased straw is MORE prone to contamination.&nbsp; I'm not new to this.&nbsp; I have bales of straw stacked all the way to the roof of my barn.&nbsp; I buy it by the semi-truck load, as well as buying over 1000 pounds of rye berries per month.&nbsp; Straw IS a one flush wonder.&nbsp; That's why it's so beneficial.&nbsp; You get your product in one flush rather than waiting for several flushes.&nbsp; This is far more efficient.&nbsp; You get one flush and then have a second substrate colonized and waiting to take its place.<br />You 'can' get more than one flush from straw, but my preference is to put the spent straw logs outdoors in a shady spot and let them flush there.&nbsp; This clears out fruiting room real estate for a new straw substrate, making the most of available space.<br />RR","title":"Re: Straw: To case or not to
