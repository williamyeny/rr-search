sets/mushrooms and different spectrum's has absolutely no role in the amount of fruit bodies that form. </blockquote><br />That's absolutely false.&nbsp; Every qualified/experienced mycologist in the world disagrees with that, and I personally have thousands of side-by-side grows with different frequencies of light that have shown conclusively that certain color temperatures of light stimulate much better pinsets than others.&nbsp;  Don't give bad advice based on a few grows with such an easy as shit species to grow as cubensis.&nbsp; Even with cubes, some strains flat-out won't fruit without proper lighting.<br />After a few more years experimenting with various strains, substrains and species, you'll change your mind.<br />Certain substrains of cubensis develop that will fruit in total darkness, just like the common button mushrooms you find in the grocery stores.&nbsp; <br />However, most require light to form abundant primordia and to develop full, well formed fruits.&nbsp; That's a fact.&nbsp; Light is a secondary pinning trigger, so nobody should think it's the most important facet of growing.&nbsp; Once you get the other factors down, light can be the deciding factor between a mediocre pinset and a perfect flush, time after time. <br />RR","title":"Re:
