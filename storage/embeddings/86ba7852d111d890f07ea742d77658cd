nutrition that wasn't known when they were growing up.<br />Generally, fruit size with cubensis is related to substrate moisture content.&nbsp; I'm sure on your next grow, you'll get larger mushrooms just by using dunk and roll, or paying closer attention to humidity, light, air exchange, etc., even if you use spores from the small fruits.&nbsp; I'd suggest cloning from a cluster if there's any on your substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: how important genetics of shrooms in terms of
