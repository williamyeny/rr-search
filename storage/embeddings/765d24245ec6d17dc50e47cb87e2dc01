of hydrated lime over a much larger amount of calcium carbonate.&nbsp; The reason is the hydrated lime will swing the pH up much faster, which helps to prevent mold spores from germinating.&nbsp; You don't want lime in substrates because mushroom mycelium(as does mold) prefers a slightly acidic media.<br />Use agricultural gypsum.&nbsp; Many growers shred drywall, and indeed some brands of agricultural gypsum are obviously made from shredded drywall scraps because I've pulled pieces of white and gray paper from them.&nbsp; Don't use plaster of paris unless you're going to prepare it per the instructions and then after it sets, grind it back down to a powder for use.<br />Just a note here:&nbsp; If you're buying calcium carbonate, don't get food grade from a brewing supply because it's not needed for mushroom growing.&nbsp; You should be able to get it for a fraction of the price you paid.<br />RR","title":"Re: Calcium Carbonate & Hydrated
