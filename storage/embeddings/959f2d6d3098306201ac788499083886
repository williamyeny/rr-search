Mushrooms don't thrive on pure O2 any more than humans do.&nbsp; Plain, fresh air is what mushroom mycelium needs to be happy and fruit prolifically.<br />Perhaps the best use for your concentrator is to keep it by your bed for those mornings you wake up with a bad hangover from tequila or budweiser.&nbsp; A tall glass of water followed by fifteen minutes @ 4 liters will flat out <b>cure</b> a hangover.
