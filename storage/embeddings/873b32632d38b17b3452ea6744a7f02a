the myth that coir is only suited as a casing material.&nbsp; I had been experimenting with coir substrates for several years, posting the results on the usenet group ADM(under the name skyypilot) and mycotopia, which I was moderating at the time. <br />I said it's better suited as a bulk substrate material and was immediately told all about how it had no nutes, I was wrong, etc.&nbsp; Today, it's the substrate of choice for people living in cities.<br />Disregard what I said in that post about casing.&nbsp; Subsequent to that post, I experimented a lot with uncased bulk substrates and found they perform as well or better than cased, and fruit a week or so earlier.<br />RR","title":"Re: Spawn bags with
