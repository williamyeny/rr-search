can take without bursting, in that case, skip the simmer. </blockquote><br />Incorrect info.&nbsp; Rye grains don't burst from soaking; it softens and hydrates them.&nbsp; The boil doesn't cause hydrated grains to burst, because they're already softened.&nbsp; The boil is not to hydrate the grains.&nbsp; The boil is to get the grains hot so the excess moisture steams off after draining.&nbsp; It's all demonstrated in the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">rye grain prep video</a> that has been successfully used by tens of thousands of growers who <i>follow the video without making modifications to the procedure.</i><br />To flexorman, gypsum will appear to dissolve in water.&nbsp; It's still there.&nbsp; Most horticultural grade gypsum in the US is made from drywall scraps.&nbsp; I have no idea how drywall is made in your country, but if you're not using the green board gypsum intended for bathrooms, it won't have fungicides in it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Grain
