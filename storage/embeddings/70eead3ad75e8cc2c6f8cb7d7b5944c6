Constant FAE, even at that small amount, will yield much more. Keep fanning with this so long as you keep humidity up. </blockquote><br />Never use a fan in the room with a shotgun terrarium.&nbsp; It will screw up the natural air currents the terrarium is engineered to function by. This has been known for a decade.<br />Perhaps you should take a break from handing out advice until you've actually done a grow or two. . .please.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions on SGFC
