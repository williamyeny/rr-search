yes they do get cool.</blockquote><br />I can't believe this is such a tough concept to grasp.&nbsp; A cold cave with warm air entering will cool the warm air to its dew point, thus forming condensation.&nbsp;  A tent will be slightly warmed by the sun even in winter, thus condensation will form.&nbsp; If you're breathing inside a closed space, condensation will form.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />and explain to me my prediciment of the condensation on my bedroom windows (where i run a humidifier) in the winter and not the rest of my house?&nbsp; its not any warmer in that room than the rest of the house.&nbsp; its because of higher humidity in that room. </blockquote><br />Yes.&nbsp; More humidity in the room will cause the air against the window to be cooled to the dewpoint at a higher temperature than the air in the rest of your house.&nbsp; The condensation is not telling you there's a certain humidity in the room, it's only telling you the air against the window has cooled to the dewpoint.<br />You guys really need to google this question if you're still not getting it.&nbsp; It's off topic here.<br />RR","title":"Re: For the record, EVERYONE should
