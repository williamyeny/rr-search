While some growers consider 80% pretty darn good, I consider a 20% failure rate completely unacceptable.&nbsp; My jars of sclerotia may 'look' not to have a filter, but they're filtered with a synthetic filter disk between the lid and the ring.<br />Pan Cyans don't produce sclerotia.&nbsp; Many species produce stroma and other weird clumps that are commonly mistaken for sclerotia.<br /><i>Mexicana a, Mexicana b, Jalisco</i>, and the new <i>Atl 7</i> are all good stone producers.&nbsp; <i>Tamps</i> should also be in the list, although Mex a is my personal favorite.<br />Hydrate your grains or rye grass seed with <i>weak</i> liquid coffee, and you'll get more rocks.&nbsp; I don't know why, it just does.&nbsp; You can get the measurements from my <a
