Obviously on overcast days I have the curtains and blinds thrown wide, but is real direct sunlight too intense? On those really bright days, would blinds open but curtains drawn provide a nice level of ambient light?</blockquote><br />A very bright window usually enough in the summer months when days are long.&nbsp; During the winter, when days are much shorter, supplement with fluorescent lighting in the daylight(6500K) range.&nbsp; If you draw the curtains to keep your house cool, use the fluorescent lamp.<br />A few minutes of direct sunlight per day is great.&nbsp; More than that and it can tend to dry out your cakes or other substrates, but a few minutes is a wonderful pinning trigger.<br />When looking for manure, coffee grinds, etc., simply say it's for your garden.&nbsp; That's a good enough answer and all that's required.&nbsp; When I lived in a condo in Seattle, I walked right up to the mounted police department stables and walked away with a large bag of horse manure.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about lighting and ratios - baby's first
