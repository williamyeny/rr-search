I have about 600 lbs of supplemented sawdust colonizing in large filter patch bags. Eventually, I'll have to erect a new building just for colonizing substrates, but for now, we're giving up our living space to try to get the farm started.<br />I'm doing everything on a tight budget, but I'm still going to have at least $20K tied up by the time it's operational, and I already own the property, free and clear.&nbsp; I have a creek flowing through the forested part of my land, so when the danger of freezing is over, I plan to move my substrates to shelves I've built along the creek's edge while construction of the mushroom cave continues.&nbsp; Right now, we're still waiting for the snow to melt and the ground to unfreeze so the track hoe and bulldozer can get in to dig out the ground.<br />You have to remember, grocery stores won't buy from you until you can guarantee a steady supply of product, week in and week out.&nbsp; I won't be going for the restaurant market, because the nearest one to me is 70+ miles away.&nbsp; I'm going to supply organic shiitake and oysters to Safeway and another NE Washington State/southern BC grocery chain, via a wholesale grocer who passes within a few miles of me now on his route between Spokane, WA and Grand Forks, BC twice a week.&nbsp; Be sure to do your homework and the math to make sure you don't toss away good money and then not have a market, or not be able to grow enough to get on the top side of the profit curve.<br />RR","title":"Re: Feasibility of opening a gourmet mushroom growing
