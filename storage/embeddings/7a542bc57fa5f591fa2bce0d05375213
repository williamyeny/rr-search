This means your mushroom mycelium is just as harmed as other organisms.&nbsp; Further still, none of this is a concern with proper sterile procedure and using grain jars where contaminants can be seen and ID'd before transfer.&nbsp; Grain jars will colonize with a thousand times as much mycelium in a fraction the time it takes LC to barely make enough for a syringe or two.<br />It's not that LC never works, but that other procedures work much better.&nbsp; You're free to follow other advice all you want, but don't get irritated with experienced members here trying to spread good information and counter all the bad that's out there being returned with search engine results.<br />Speaking of search engine results, a simple search here will reveal at least ten LC fail threads for every LC success thread, and bear in mind people like to brag a lot more than they like to admit failure, so the ratio is even worse than it looks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Adding Peroxide To
