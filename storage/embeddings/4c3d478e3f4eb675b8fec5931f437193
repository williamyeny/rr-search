after inoculating and shaking very well the spores take in many parts of the jar rather then taking in 2-5spots having to wait a week or so to shake.</blockquote><br />Exactly.<br />And, this is why you shouldn't do it.&nbsp; Instead of the mycelium starting out in a few places, it starts out in hundreds, with hundreds or even thousands of different strains, many of which are non-compatible.&nbsp; This means instead of a coherent organism at fruiting time, you have hundreds of strains, each holding onto a piece of substrate the size of a thimble.&nbsp; This is why fruiting performance is usually poor with dark syringes and the reason experienced growers always use the fewest spores possible.<br />The problem which perpetuates this myth is a few unscrupulous shysters who sell dark syringes because they know noobs will pay extra for them because it's mostly non-experienced noobs who buy spore syringes.<br />In addition, you should never shake after inoculating with spores.&nbsp; You should let them germinate and 'mate' to form dikaryons before the first shake.<br />RR","title":"Re: My quick version of a concentrated spore
