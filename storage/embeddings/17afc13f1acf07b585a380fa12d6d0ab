strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, and each viable spore creates one hyphae.&nbsp; Since a sporeprint has many millions of spores, there are millions of strains going to be produced, not one strain regardless of the name someone wrote on the print or syringe to sell it to noobs who think it's going to perform differently than another.<br />There are some legitimate vendors who have narrowed down the gene pool to provide consistent results, ie albinos, PE, etc.,(check out posts by workman) but by far most of the people selling spores are unscrupulous and simply label the random syringe or print with whatever 'name' the person orders.<br />RR","title":"Re: different cap colors from same strain/substrate but seperate
