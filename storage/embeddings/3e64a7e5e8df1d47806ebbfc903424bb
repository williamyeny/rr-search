Lift it to fan and/or mist.&nbsp; Increased CO2 levels are detrimental to pinning, not an asset.<br />Freshly made straw logs will drip for a couple of days due to the excess water being squeezed out of the straw.&nbsp; Remember to pack straw logs tightly.&nbsp; Put a tray under them for a few days.&nbsp; The full tek is on my DVD, but you can get the idea from <a

mini-greenhouse or even in the open air if your house isn't too dry.&nbsp; They also do well in the spring and fall months outdoors in a shady spot, especially if it's the rainy season.&nbsp; Ditto for laundry baskets.<br />RR","title":"Re: confused about co2 and
