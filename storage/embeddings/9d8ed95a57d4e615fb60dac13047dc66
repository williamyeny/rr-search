/>Chances are if every jar in an incubator contaminates, it would have contaminated outside of the incubator too.... that kind of mass contamination usually indicates dirty syringes, improper/unsterile inoculation/cross contamination/g2g or the likes. </blockquote><br />Sometimes that's true, but often it indicates jars colonizing in a closed space.&nbsp; Even on an open shelf, if I get trich in one jar and don't notice it right away, the jars immediately around it often get infected a few days later.&nbsp; No jar filter is perfect, and if you have a massive spore release, it easily overwhelms even the best filter material.&nbsp; That's why I recommend colonizing out in the open.<br />In addition, stale air in a box leads to anaerobic conditions, which promote bacteria.&nbsp; Furthermore, mushroom mycelium has circadian rhythms, thus having them on an open shelf exposes the mycelium to a day-night schedule of light and temperature fluctuations which helps establish the pattern for later, resulting in a better fruiting performance when the time comes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Which mushrooms can grow neer or under 60
