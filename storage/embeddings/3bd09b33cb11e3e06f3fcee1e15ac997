/>A lot of people move agar wedges to a master grain jar and then G2G to 10 other jars when the master is fully colonized.</blockquote><br />This is the preferred method.&nbsp; Simply cut a piece of agar and drop it right into a jar of sterilized grains, using a flame sterilized scalpel and laminar flow hood to ensure a sterile transfer.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>winged_1 said:</strong><br />You could squirt sterile water into your agar dish and shake it good to liberate some mycelium and then suck it up into a syringe to inject into a LC or spawn jar.</blockquote><br />This method 'works', but adds an additional vector or two of contamination, therefore is not preferred.&nbsp; When growers move from brf tek to grains and bulk substrates, they pick up a flow hood and ditch the syringes.&nbsp; The last time I used a syringe was 5 years ago while filming <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">\"Let's Grow
