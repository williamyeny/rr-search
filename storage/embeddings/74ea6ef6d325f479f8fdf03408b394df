I'd say bury it into a flowerpot or outdoor garden area.&nbsp; Bacteria, yeast, and molds are all beneficial to an outdoor soil ecosystem and if it did fruit, the fruits would be completely fine to eat.&nbsp; Anyone who says otherwise must think jesus cruises around cow pastures at night, secretly sterilizing piles of manure and inoculating them with vendor supplied spore syringes.<br />However, that's just grains, and I doubt enough mushroom mycelium has survived to take off outdoors.&nbsp; Boil the jars in a pot of water for an hour or two to kill off the nasty stuff before you dump it in the trash or down the garbage disposal in your sink.&nbsp; Wash the jars with soap and water and reuse.<br />RR","title":"Re: Yeast jars fully colonize, can they be used?--*PICS
