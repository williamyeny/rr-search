Nobody uses bubbler wands any more, they don't work well.&nbsp; Perlite alone will give 99% humidity.<br />2. If you put a coffee filter under your cakes, the mycelium will grow into it, and then into the perlite below.&nbsp; You're supposed to put FOIL under the cakes.<br />3. I haven't used desiccants in many years.&nbsp; Simply fan dry mushrooms without heat.&nbsp; Some people use them, but not necessary in my experience.<br />4. Polyester above or below the perlite, and for what purpose?&nbsp; Water should <i>never</i> be added to perlite.&nbsp; Any standing water in perlite will LOWER humidity by rendering any perlite below water level useless.&nbsp; Water is also a breeding ground for contaminants.<br />5. We've long recommended fan drying with the mushrooms on paper towels or newspaper, etc.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />THESE COMMENTS ONLY APPLY TO THE METHOD OF BULK CASING USING PLASTIC TERRARIUMS USING THE REVERSE HYDROPONIC TECHNIQUE OF BUBBLING AIR THROUGH STERILIZED WATER THROUGH A BED OF PERLITE, THUS RESULTING IN AUTOMATED PRODUCTION WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF DAILY SPRAYING OR THE MANUAL REMOVAL OF CARBON DIOXIDE.</blockquote><br />This idea has been around for many years, but it's been dropped in favor of much more effective growing methods.&nbsp; Perhaps you're not aware that fresh air exchange, which causes evaporation of moisture from the substrate is the number ONE pinning trigger?&nbsp; Aquarium pumps and bubbler wands will not deliver the amount of fresh air required for best performance of brf cakes, and certainly not enough for a bulk substrate.<br />The term you invented of 'reverse hydroponics' has nothing to do with what you're proposing, which is to forget everything we've learned over the last decade.&nbsp; Have you scrolled through the logs and seen the tremendous performance people are getting from their projects today, compared to what they were getting several years ago?&nbsp; Check it out.<br />RR","title":"Re: \"Reverse
