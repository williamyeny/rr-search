Unfortunately, my love is fungi and growing mushrooms, developing new TEKs, and constantly experimenting to find better methods of cultivation. Being a moderator means one has to walk a fine line between censorship and police action, neither of which I'm any good at. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif\" alt=\":shrug:\" title=\":shrug:\"/><br />RR<br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/images/lock.gif\"> <b>This thread has been closed.</b>"}}
