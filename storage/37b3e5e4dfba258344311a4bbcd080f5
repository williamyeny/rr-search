It's an accepted method of pasteurization, and live mycelium can withstand up to ten percent bleach, which is much stronger than any of the teks call for.&amp;nbsp; Lime is also an acceptable method, thus I combine lime and hot water for great results, as demonstrated in the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree about sterilizing straw unless you're going to inoculate and colonize it under sterile conditions.&amp;nbsp; If you're making straw logs that get holes punctured right after making them up, then you don't want to sterilize.&amp;nbsp; We pasteurize to kill mold spores, not bacteria, many of which generally survive the pasteurization process.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10495304</next>\n<prev>10495113</prev>\n<first>10494235</first>\n<last>10570603</last>\n<when>1244845598</when>\n<utime>06/13/09 01:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
