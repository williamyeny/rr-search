The steam above the water line will sterilize the jars, provided the pot has a tight fitting lid.  Steam for 90 minutes to two hours after the steam begins escaping from around the edges of the kettle's lid.  Add water as needed to keep the pot from boiling dry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7723702</next>\n<prev>7723541</prev>\n<first>7723369</first>\n<last>7723702</last>\n<when>1196957895</when>\n<utime>12/06/07 06:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
