They're even suggested for pf cakes, which can be successfully steamed because rice doesn't harbor bacterial endospores.  Grains such as corn, rye, millet, and wbs DO harbor bacterial endospores and need to be pressure sterilized.<br />Even if a person tries something once or twice and gets away with it, it's no reason to suggest such to others.
