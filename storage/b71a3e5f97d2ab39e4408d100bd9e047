It's not an issue with the tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply run an extension cord from another room such as the kitchen so it's on a different circuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, make your substrates on the dry side.&amp;nbsp; It's easy to add moisture later if necessary, but very hard to get rid of excess.&amp;nbsp; I now start out slightly below field capacity, so that when I squeeze a handful of substrate very hard, no moisture at all comes out, but if I added any, it would squeeze out.&amp;nbsp; Then, simply mist during the cropping cycle to keep it at that level.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15767969</next>\n<prev>15767543</prev>\n<first>15767458</first>\n<last>15767969</last>\n<when>1328548780</when>\n<utime>02/06/12 07:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
