You're supposed to use a shredder, lawn mower, weed whacker, etc., to chop the straw into 1&quot; to 3&quot; pieces.  Doing so will tighten up the straw and prevent your grains from going to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, when building straw tubs, don't mix the spawn into the straw.  Put down a layer of straw, followed by a layer of grain spawn.  This will also help to keep your spawn in place until it takes off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7439999</next>\n<prev>7439869</prev>\n<first>7439869</first>\n<last>7440762</last>\n<when>1190477536</when>\n<utime>09/22/07 07:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
