You need at least 1&quot; of air space below the terrarium. Your humidity will actually increase if you'll follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;tek&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The only problem I see is those appear to be larger than 1/4&quot; holes(6mm).&amp;nbsp; It must be remembered that a 1/2&quot; hole is 4 times as large as a 1/4&quot; hole, so by going larger you can screw things up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8681062</next>\n<prev>8678819</prev>\n<first>8677946</first>\n<last>8695713</last>\n<when>1216996915</when>\n<utime>07/25/08 05:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
