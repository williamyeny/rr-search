Even a temperature into the 60's F., will work ok.  Set the fan on a timer to come on for a minute, once per hour.  That will be plenty.   There is no need to filter air in a fruiting chamber.  Just keep air exchange and humidity.  If you're setting up a tub type chamber, just use perlite humidification.  Humidifiers are better suited to mini-greenhouse operation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5994092</next>\n<prev>5994005</prev>\n<first>5994005</first>\n<last>5996247</last>\n<when>1156473379</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 05:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
