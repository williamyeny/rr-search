It's part of a balanced diet.  Verm is great mixed with everything mycological except straw.  Used coffee grinds from your morning pot of coffee are also an excellent additive.  Ditto for worm castings. A small amount of chicken manure is also beneficial but don't go over 5% by volume of the substrate.  Put a combination of all together in your substrate and watch your mushies thank you for it.<br />RR"}}
