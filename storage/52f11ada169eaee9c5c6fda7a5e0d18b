If you could use manure tea for 'nutrients', we'd have all learned to grow mushrooms on rockwool cubes years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir is the equal of horse manure for growing straw and dung loving mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; If you want to 'boost' the coir, add shredded straw or even pull the weeds out of your garden and shred them to use in your substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14764780</next>\n<prev>14764715</prev>\n<first>14720232</first>\n<last>15011338</last>\n<when>1310611403</when>\n<utime>07/14/11 05:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
