That's why we still get a gazillion 'what strain is best' posts.  The pf tek section of the video is available on YouTube or Yahoo here: <a href=\"http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=mushroom+cultivation&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://video.search.yahoo.com/se<wbr>arch/video?p=mushroom+cultivation<wbr>&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei<wbr>=UTF-8</a> They're out of order, so be sure to watch them in sequence.  Feel free to pm the links to anybody who you think needs it.  If they buy the DVD, they'll get a lot more info in addition to pf tek.<br />RR"}}
