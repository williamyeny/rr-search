What I did, though, was mix the vermiculite and water first. Then, I would slowly add the BRF while mixing. That way, it would come out light and fluffy. The first time I tried making cakes, I did it the way you are, and it came out like clay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way to do it.&amp;nbsp; Normally, you'd mix the dry ingredients and then add water, but with brf cakes, the verm and rice flour are such different sizes, it's better to get the verm wet first, and then mix in the flour.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11628164</next>\n<prev>11627270</prev>\n<first>11502786</first>\n<last>11628629</last>\n<when>1260520696</when>\n<utime>12/11/09 10:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
