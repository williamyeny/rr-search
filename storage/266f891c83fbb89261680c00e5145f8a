That were all kept in the same bag in the same fridge. They may all be contaminated; maybe with something that doesn't thrive until I spawn to bulk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why you should always sniff each and every grain jar before spawning.&amp;nbsp; If it's contaminated with bacteria it will smell like garbage. If it's contaminated with mold, it will smell like dirt, or earthy.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium has a fresh mushrooms scent which can't be mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19937765</next>\n<prev>19937339</prev>\n<first>19932554</first>\n<last>19937765</last>\n<when>1399167287</when>\n<utime>05/04/14 04:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
