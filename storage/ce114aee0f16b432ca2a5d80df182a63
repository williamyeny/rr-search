I put about 15ccs of sterile water and was really unable to reclaim it back out due to the verm absorbing it all! Did i just find the stupidest way ever to destroy a Pf Jar? or do you think it will recover?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mycelium in the brf jar &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; recover, but doubtful since it wasn't fully colonized.&amp;nbsp; However, as soon as the water hit the dry verm layer it became contaminated and useless.&amp;nbsp; You can't do my grain LC tek with brf cakes.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it's pretty lame with grains too, as are all LCs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17735912</next>\n<prev>17724484</prev>\n<first>17724061</first>\n<last>17743330</last>\n<when>1359719512</when>\n<utime>02/01/13 01:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
