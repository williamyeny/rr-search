Filming of all the mushroom stuff is complete, and has been for weeks.  I'm doing the hard part now, because I'm having to learn the software and graphics creation stuff as I go along.  I'm kicking mrs rabbit out of the house this weekend, sending her to her sisters house, so I can be left alone to do the geek work without interruption.
