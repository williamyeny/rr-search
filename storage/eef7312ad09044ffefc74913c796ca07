The moisture that builds up in the bottom of a jar after full colonizaton is the excess metabolyte.  You can open the lid and pour it out.  As long as the jar is at 100%, it won't contaminate.  If you have a flow hood, use it, but it's not necessary.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3965584</next>\n<prev>3965243</prev>\n<first>3959249</first>\n<last>3966031</last>\n<when>1111704005</when>\n<utime>03/25/05 12:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
