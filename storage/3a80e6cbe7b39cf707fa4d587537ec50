The steam will not stay there unless it's kept under pressure, and foil sure as hell won't do that.&nbsp; I'd suggest searching some of these terms or look at the <b>Similar Threads</b> links below to find a few of the thousands of times your very idea has been tried before with 100% failure by people who don't understand the engineering behind why steam under pressure is warmer than 212F/100C.&nbsp; Those of us who have been doing this for decades don't use pressure vessels for sterilization because someone told us to.&nbsp; We use them because it's the only way that works for indoor sterile culture.<br />If you want to grow in an unsterile environment, grow outdoors.&nbsp; There, nature is in balance and the mushroom mycelium will hold it's own.&nbsp; Indoors, we use sterile procedure to get the most bang for the buck.&nbsp; We want to get a pound of mushrooms from a small substrate, not a pound of mushrooms from a 100 acre pasture.<br />RR"}}
