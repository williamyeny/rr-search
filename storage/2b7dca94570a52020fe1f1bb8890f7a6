It's how we all learn, and how the whole log tek came to be in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reasons for keeping a log wrapped up until it pins are: 1) The wrapping helps to hold in moisture so the log doesn't dry out due to evaporation before all that moisture is needed for fruit development, and  2) by holding in the CO2 during colonization, less of your substrate is consumed by the mycelium, therefore more of your substrate is still in place when fruiting time comes along.  This helps to insure a good flush of large fruitbodies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People need to lighten up.  I like it when guys experiment and have the courtesy to post their results, good or bad.  If someone improves on the straw log tek, my hat is off to them.  There's always a better way to do something, but if we never experiment, we never learn.  Rock on mr.
