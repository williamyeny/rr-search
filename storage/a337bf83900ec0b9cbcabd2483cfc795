Of course, I did edit the sound, because I said &lt;i&gt;fuck.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt; Fully colonized cakes are pretty darn tough.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8444917</next>\n<prev>8444676</prev>\n<first>8443432</first>\n<last>8446757</last>\n<when>1211771099</when>\n<utime>05/26/08 06:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
