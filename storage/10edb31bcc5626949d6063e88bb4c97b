What you've described is not strain isolation at all.  Concentrate at first on getting a harvest and learn the basics such as grain preparation.  Forget the peroxide, it's for cobweb mold, not grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each drop of spore solution from a syringe will have up to a few dozen strains worth of spores.  Strain isolation is allowing the plate to grow out for a few days, then making ten or more transfers from the leading edge of the growth to new plates.  The second set of plates should begin to show some sectoring.  Transfer each sector to new dishes, and continue to repeat the process until you have non-sectoring mycelium in each plate.  At this time, transfer part of each dish to well marked quarts of rye to grow out, and put the rest of each plate in the refrigerator until the rye has grown out and fruited, then tested for the qualities you desire.  When you find the strains you like, you can then go back to the refrigerator, and pull those plates out to make master slants with, that can then be stored and used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't fall into the trap of thinking the 'prettiest' or most rhizomorphic mycelium is the best.  Fruit out each substrain you isolate to determine quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three drops of solution from a single syringe can easily use up 100 or more petri dishes by the time you isolate each substrain out.  for this reason, I purchase three and four compartment petri dishes, so each dish can have multiple cultures, saving a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6347728</next>\n<prev>6347214</prev>\n<first>6346826</first>\n<last>6348502</last>\n<when>1165600655</when>\n<utime>12/08/06 07:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
