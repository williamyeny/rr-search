I actually stopped misting 5 days ago or so and was wondering if it's time to mist again? Or do I wait until fruits are actually taking place? IDK man I'm so confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're confused by idiots without a clue.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully, 5 days of no misting doesn't abort all your work.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to continue misting to replace the moisture which has evaporated.&amp;nbsp; If the substrate dries out, your fruits are all going to abort.

Misting on the lid and keeping perlite moist below your cakes is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;False information-very bad advice.&amp;nbsp; Get a grow or two under your belt before repeating bad advice from other noobs.&amp;nbsp; The damn lid is plastic and has no need of water.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are 90% water and DO have a need for it.&amp;nbsp; Mist as required to prevent drying, while providing plenty of fresh air so the mushrooms don't ever sit saturated wet with no air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always had to facepalm at these guys who say not to mist or to mist gently from way up so the mist falls ever so delicately.&amp;nbsp; Folks, mushrooms fruit in nature after thunderstorms where heavy rain and hail beat the crap out of the manure pie.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19524106</next>\n<prev>19523032</prev>\n<first>19522955</first>\n<last>19533642</last>\n<when>1391611806</when>\n<utime>02/05/14 04:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
