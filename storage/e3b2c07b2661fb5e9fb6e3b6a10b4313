They always treat me like a hero for getting rid of it for them.  Last week, the guy even came out while I was shoveling and handed me a cold beer. Get the dried, field aged nuggets that easily break apart in your hands.  It takes about five minutes to fill a bag that will make dozens of trays, and it's free.  Well, I say free.  $3+ a gallon for the gas to get there sucks.  Better fill two bags to make the trip pay off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5925976</next>\n<prev>5925910</prev>\n<first>5925694</first>\n<last>5929452</last>\n<when>1154557007</when>\n<utime>08/03/06 01:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
