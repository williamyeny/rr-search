I've incubated on an open shelf in the mid 70's, then moved trays to the greenhouse in the summer, which because of the lights and no AC was in the mid 80's to low 90's and had some of the best pinsets ever.  Note this is a ten degree increase over incubation temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold shocking is for cold weather edibles and won't benefit cubensis at all.  Those of you who have been cold shocking should stop and watch what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid confusion, note that an overnight dunk in the refrigerator is for control of bacteria during the soak and is not cold shocking.
