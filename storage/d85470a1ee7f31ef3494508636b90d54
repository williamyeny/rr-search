So you think my issue isnt the no soak/simmer tek but the way I run my PC with the weight on from turn on to shut off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's exactly why you fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are building 15 psi of air pressure. What you want is 15 psi of steam pressure.&amp;nbsp; This means you have to leave the weight off for a few minutes after you see steam venting.&amp;nbsp; This gets rid of all the air in the pressure cooker, ensuring the entire area is saturated with steam.&amp;nbsp; At this point put the weight on to build pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The method of simply putting grains and water in a jar to pressure cook is how we did it for decades.&amp;nbsp; We also had to deal with clumpy grains, a higher fail ratio, and slower colonization due to all the grain dust and dirt.&amp;nbsp; It isn't however the source of your contamination-that's your incorrect pressure cooker operation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19279154</next>\n<prev>19279086</prev>\n<first>19278858</first>\n<last>19284337</last>\n<when>1387134920</when>\n<utime>12/15/13 09:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
