Mushrooms <i>eat</i> their food.  I speculate in a few years, you won't ever even hear the term 'nitrogen' in relation to fungi.  Potency isn't related to substrate, so you can add all the junk you want and it won't make them more potent.  You'll want to isolate for a strain on agar that is more potent, and then save it in master slants.<br />RR"}}
