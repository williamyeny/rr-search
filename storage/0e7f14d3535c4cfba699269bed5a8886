{"key":"post-5609480","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5609480</id>\n<content>Overlay is not the same as full colonization of the casing layer. Overlay is when the casing layer has not only fully colonized, but the mycelium has matted up, forming what almost looks like a crust.  Overlay is very rare.  In all the trays I've ever made, I've never had it happen, so have no pictures.  If you'll follow the basic casing teks, you won't get overlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember:  A fully colonized casing layer means you either used too much coir in the mix or waited too long to initiate pinning.  It is not overlay.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5609713</next>\n<prev>5609443</prev>\n<first>5601692</first>\n<last>5611241</last>\n<when>1147214988</when>\n<utime>05/10/06 01:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
