Secondly, most of those type units measure humidity at the meter itself, not the probe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have too many holes.  It takes that many to constantly provide air exchange.  However, understand that you have to pick up misting to replace the lost humidity due to air exchange.  A loss of moisture from the substrate(replaced by rain or misting) is perhaps the second most important pinning trigger.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a cigar shop and get an analog hygrometer.  Calibrate it by wrapping in a damp towel for an hour, and then adjusting the dial so it reads 99%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a dry climate or run air conditioning which dries out the air, run a cool mist humidifier in the room your grow is located.  Try to get your ambient room humidity up to 50% and you'll do fine.  As said above, don't forget to step up the misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7360680</next>\n<prev>7358214</prev>\n<first>7357589</first>\n<last>7363670</last>\n<when>1188658218</when>\n<utime>09/01/07 05:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
