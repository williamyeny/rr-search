First, is having too large of holes in your lid.  You want very high CO2 levels during colonization.  If your lid allows too much exchange, pins will form because air exchange is a major pinning trigger.<br />The second biggest cause is bacterial contamination in the substrate/spawn material.  The mycelium gets up against the contamination and it presents a natural barrier that is equal to the glass edges of the jar.  The mycelium senses full colonization and sets pins because full colonization is also a major pinning trigger.<br />By the way, small invitro pins can be used right along with the grains to spawn to bulk.  They don't need to be removed.   I've done this many times, and the pins revert back to mycelium and take off growing again.<br />RR"}}
