After that, you set your mycelium back and it does little good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jars don't stall, mycelium does.  The biggest cause is failure to provide gas exchange so they run out of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second biggest cause of stalling is bacterial contamination.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quart jar of healthy mycelium on rye that is shaken at 25% will be completly colonized three to four days later.  If not, something is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6490272</next>\n<prev>6488778</prev>\n<first>6488589</first>\n<last>6490272</last>\n<when>1169569275</when>\n<utime>01/23/07 06:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
