Once pins are set, humidity can be reduced a bit, but don't get out of the 90's. The 'old' advice of keeping humidity lower for cased substrates is incorrect.  As hyphae said, keep humidity high, and air exchange high. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PE's don't pin well unless you do strain isolations and find a really good fruiting isolate.  What you have is about average pinset for multispore inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6455346</next>\n<prev>6454432</prev>\n<first>6454112</first>\n<last>6455346</last>\n<when>1168685622</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 12:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
