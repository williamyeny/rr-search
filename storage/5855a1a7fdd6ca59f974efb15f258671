It's that time of year, and ever since I showed that trick to mrs rabbit, I hear the vacuum cleaner start up in the kitchen several times an hour.  They love the fruit bowls and anything else sweet.  They're attracted to the smell of the mycelium, but they don't usually breed in our projects.  They rarely cause much problem unless they're there by the thousands.  The red pepper spray you can get at hydro shops knocks them dead too and is non toxic to us, although it might spice up your fruits if any gets on them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my computer screen is any indication, they're also attracted to light, so a small zapper might work, but I've never tried one for gnats yet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5901686</next>\n<prev>5900843</prev>\n<first>5899363</first>\n<last>5904771</last>\n<when>1153920995</when>\n<utime>07/26/06 04:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
