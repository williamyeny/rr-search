NEVER leave grains on the surface where they're exposed to contaminants.  You didn't make a contaminant barrier, you made a contamination magnet.  Always cover any grains with your substrate material.  If you don't, they dry out, and the mushroom mycelium goes into stasis, and then the faster growing molds can take over and grow on your exposed grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing looks green in the top picture.  If that's just crappy lighting, then it's ready to case.  I hope it succeeds for you, but don't hold out high hopes with all that exposed grain on top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6881801</next>\n<prev>6881742</prev>\n<first>6881731</first>\n<last>6883394</last>\n<when>1178500332</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 04:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
