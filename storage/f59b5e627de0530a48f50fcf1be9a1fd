It's not just FAE you want, but actual wind and turbulence now and then to 'wash' the stale air out of the casing layer itself.  I believe in keeping it simple with tubs.  You can simply drill a few holes top and bottom for FAE rather than using a pump.  Just remember as said above, fan vigorously a few times a day.
