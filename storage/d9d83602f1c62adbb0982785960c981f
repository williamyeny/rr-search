Already it is reading 100% humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So I guess sticking the hygrometer to one of the FC walls gives inaccurate readings&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly.&amp;nbsp; The holes in the sides admit air from your room, which will be at a lower humidity than the air within the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; If your hygrometer is against one of those holes, room air is passing right through the hygrometer.&amp;nbsp; Probably the best thing is to hang the hygrometer from a wire attached to the center of the lid, so it sits near the center of the chamber.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you (or anyone else reading this) built your shotgun terrarium per the tek, you can put the hygrometer away and forget it. Your humidity IS fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12822416</next>\n<prev>12822056</prev>\n<first>12821914</first>\n<last>12822510</last>\n<when>1277824140</when>\n<utime>06/29/10 06:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
