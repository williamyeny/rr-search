Cut a 5/8 hole and stick a water hose into it, and run this into you're terrarium.  Now, take a pair of vice grips or whatever you have, and pinch the hose until just enough moisture passes through it to maintain humidity.  You can leave it on 24/7 without a timer if you pinch the hose down enough.  Experiment until you get it right. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1600780</next>\n<prev>1595273</prev>\n<first>1592062</first>\n<last>1657438</last>\n<when>1054505077</when>\n<utime>06/02/03 01:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
