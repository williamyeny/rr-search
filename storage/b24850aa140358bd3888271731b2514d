The verm on top must stay totally dry.  You also want to be sure to wipe down the glass above the substrate before putting the dry verm on top.  Otherwise, contaminants will work their way down the glass into your brf.  You can't save it so don't bother.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the rest of them as well.  When one is bad, the rest are going to be suspect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5943490</next>\n<prev>5942901</prev>\n<first>5942451</first>\n<last>5943686</last>\n<when>1155046828</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 05:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
