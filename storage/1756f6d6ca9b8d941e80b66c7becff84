Use no more than a teaspoon for 2 gallons of soak water.  If you're soaking in plain water, skip the lime.  Use one tablespoon of gypsum per gallon of soak water, regardless of how much grains are in it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6009884</next>\n<prev>6009846</prev>\n<first>6009636</first>\n<last>6009884</last>\n<when>1156906511</when>\n<utime>08/30/06 05:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
