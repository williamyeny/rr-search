Since I produce a few thousand substrates per month, I get a LOT of metabolites when I 'birth' the substrates.&amp;nbsp; I collect these, mix with water and drain into our vegetable garden, which causes an explosion of growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking one could add 'nutrients' to a substrate during dunking to obtain extra mushroom growth is akin to thinking one could eat his own excrement and drink his own urine to get extra strength to run a marathon.&amp;nbsp; It just doesn't work that way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14750158</next>\n<prev>14750052</prev>\n<first>14749456</first>\n<last>14755970</last>\n<when>1310393343</when>\n<utime>07/11/11 05:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
