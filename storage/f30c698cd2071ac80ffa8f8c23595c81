{"key":"post-5887964","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5887964</id>\n<content>Honey is a piss poor nutrient for LC, even when used in tiny amounts.&amp;nbsp; You're using nearly 20% honey so that would be a good reason for the slow growth.&amp;nbsp; However, I've had the best luck with this species using Malt Extract Agar(MEA) supplemented with 3.5 grams of calcium-sulphate(gypsum) and 7 grams of finely ground hardwood sawdust per liter. Put the gypsum and sawdust in a coffee grinder and grind to a powder before mixing with the cold water. Tap water should be fine if it's non-chlorinated in your area, but I prefer distilled water for agar work, especially if you have a well.&amp;nbsp; I've found well water can be quite high in minerals and some of these tend to inhibit growth. Of course, well water is great if you run it through a filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, depending on which MEA recipe you use, you may want to cut back slightly on the malt and yeast to about 75% of the recommended amounts. Use the full amount of agar agar so it won't be soupy. I've found fastest growth on petri dishes when the mycelium is a big 'hungry' so a weaker mix seems to keep the mycelium searching for food.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind, this is a very slow growing mycelium compared to most other mushroom species, so attention to sterility is mandatory.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I use between 1/20 and 1/15 of a gram of gentamycin sulphate per liter in my agar as an antibiotic when germinating spores, cloning, or using a culture obtained from somebody else that might be of unknown cleanliness.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this species fruits well on most hardwoods.&amp;nbsp; In the Pacific Northwest, Alder sawdust and chips are excellent, but I've also had good luck fruiting on Douglas Fir chips mixed into Alder sawdust.&amp;nbsp; Douglas Fir sawdust and chips resulted in a poor fruiting. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5889320</next>\n<prev>5887406</prev>\n<first>5887406</first>\n<last>5946749</last>\n<when>1153605407</when>\n<utime>07/23/06 12:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
