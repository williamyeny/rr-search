Gypsum supplies calcium and sulfur, both necessary for fruit formation.  As a side benefit, gypsum helps prevent swings in pH, either up or down.  In other words, it tends to keep the pH stable, right where you set it with lime.  Every form of bulk substrate can benefit from the addition of gypsum.<br />Oyster shell flour, powdered limestone, calcium carbonate, and hydrated lime can all be used to raise the pH to the desired level.<br />The more substrate ingredients you mix together, the better performance will be.  A balanced diet will work better than any single food source.  Coffee, coir, straw, manure, compost, worm castings, etc., are all good by themselves, but mixed they're even better.<br />RR"}}
