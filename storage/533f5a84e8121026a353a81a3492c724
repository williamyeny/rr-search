Heating 400 square feet in Hawaii is not the same as heating 400 square feet in Northern Alaska.  Room insulation also matters much more than the size of the floor space in the room, as does how high the ceilings are, etc.  Heating needs are calculated in cubic feet, not square feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for a small grow area, you can usually enclose a smaller corner of the room, and heat it without heating the entire large room.  Those $45 oil filled electric space heaters toss off a lot of heat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6239291</next>\n<prev>6239158</prev>\n<first>6239158</first>\n<last>6239331</last>\n<when>1162499031</when>\n<utime>11/02/06 10:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
