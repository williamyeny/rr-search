I have at least a 99.99% success rate with grain to grain transfers.  The key is to learn to do it right.  If you don't have a flow hood, you'll need 100% still air.  Have the jar lids off no more than five seconds.  Don't set the lid down.  Hold it with one hand while pouring from your master jar with the other hand.  This allows you to return the lid as soon as possible.  Don't stick anything into the master.  Bang it against a tire to break it up, and then pour the grains out like sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean your glovebox and leave damp(with water).  Wash your gloves with alcohol after putting them on.  Wipe the jars and lids with an alcohol soaked towel prior to opening.  Work fast and accurately.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7516495</next>\n<prev>7516181</prev>\n<first>7516024</first>\n<last>7520003</last>\n<when>1192399396</when>\n<utime>10/15/07 01:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
