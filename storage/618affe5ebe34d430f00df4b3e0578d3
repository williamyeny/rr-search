In fact, they stir around the air so much they cause more problems than they solve.  I have three or four of them sitting in my storage shed, never to be used again.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879888-glove_box_007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879888-thumb_glove_box_007.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879880-glove_box_006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879880-thumb_glove_box_006.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6081341</next>\n<prev>6081295</prev>\n<first>6081031</first>\n<last>6082436</last>\n<when>1158755658</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
