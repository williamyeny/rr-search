You must wait until full colonization or you are guaranteed to get contaminants.<br />Third, you don't sterilize bulk substrates, you pasteurize them.  Sterilized substrates are much more susceptible to contamination.<br />Fourth, you don't heat treat substrates in the oven.<br />Fifth, aluminum foil and/or light will have nothing to do with contamination whether or not light hits your project.  Foil on the sides of a tray will actually increase side pinning by reflecting light down the sides deep into the substrate.<br />Sixth, spawning wbs to coir is considered a bulk substrate, not a casing.  The casing is the non-nutritious layer that is placed on TOP of a fully colonized bulk substrate.<br />Remember, your contamination problem probably would not have occurred had you waited for full colonization of your WBS, and properly pasteurized the coir before spawning to it.<br />RR"}}
