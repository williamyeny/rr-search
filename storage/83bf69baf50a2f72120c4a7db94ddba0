I thought I would try to find a way to minimize bacteria growth.</blockquote><br />Bacteria is not a contaminant of the fruiting stage.&nbsp; If bacteria takes over your grains or cakes in jars before they're colonized, you'll have problems.&nbsp; However, fully colonized spawn is not susceptible to bacteria, and in fact certain bacteria help to stimulate pinning.&nbsp; <br />That's the reason we pasteurize bulk substrates such as manure or coir rather than sterilizing them.&nbsp; It's to kill the mold spores while preserving the bacteria.<br />RR"}}
