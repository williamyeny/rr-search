{"key":"post-6348733","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6348733</id>\n<content>Bear in mind, 1 1/2 cups of grain is too much for a quart jar.  Use one cup per quart or you won't have room to shake.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also worried they might turn out too wet, due to the grains at the bottom of the jar not getting drained/dried enough.  How fast they colonize will be the test for you though.  As long as the grains look and feel dry on the surface when they go into the PC, they'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6348759</next>\n<prev>6348726</prev>\n<first>6348718</first>\n<last>6348759</last>\n<when>1165625858</when>\n<utime>12/09/06 02:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
