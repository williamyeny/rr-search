Do this several times to inoculate several dishes.  Allow them to grow for a day or two until they've expanded about 1/4&quot; from the transfered piece, and then grab another tiny piece of mycelium and again transfer to a new dish.  Don't wait for contaminants to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contaminants on agar are not failure.  That would have been a wasted jar if you hadn't used agar to clean up the culture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7548073</next>\n<prev>7548023</prev>\n<first>7547496</first>\n<last>7557764</last>\n<when>1193097877</when>\n<utime>10/23/07 03:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
