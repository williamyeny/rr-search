If the bag has been open in your house, just about anything can be lurking there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dunk in tap water.  If your local water is bad, use bottled or distilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse the substrate under a faucet prior to beginning the dunk, then rinse again afterward.  It's also best to dunk in a sealed jar in the refrigerator to prevent bacteria growing while the block is underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's a few small pins on the cake or other substrate, don't pick them unless they're aborts.  Healthy primordia/pins easily survive a dunk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5601606</next>\n<prev>5601503</prev>\n<first>5601387</first>\n<last>5603774</last>\n<when>1147040273</when>\n<utime>05/08/06 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
