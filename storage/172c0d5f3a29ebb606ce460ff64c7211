Didn't mean to sound argumentative, but only had a few minutes at the time.  Our biggest problem however is with grains or substrates contaminating, not the fruits themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I embarked on a similar mission.  The active ingredient in Banrot 40WP is approved for use on mushroom crops by the FDA, even though it is labeled by the manufacturer for use on ornamental plants only.(lawsuit concerns I suspect)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that grains, substrates, and casing layers would not germinate one single fungi spore if they were treated with Banrot.  It also appears to stop bacteria.  I left a sterilized grain jar open in my kitchen for over an hour, then inoculated with an agar wedge, and it colonized and fruited normally.  Banrot can withstand the PC, so it's usable on grains.  If I remember correctly, I used a tablespoon for each five gallons of water, then used that to hydrate the grains.  It seems like I halved that for casing and bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, those experiments were short lived even if 100% successful.  The smell of the banrot is like a pesticide, and I just hate chemicals.  I'm an organic gardener outdoors, so want to be inside as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copper is a natural fungicide, so I wonder how it would do?  I've thought of stripping a solid core wire, then winding it into a spiral to see what it would do to trichoderma, clodosporium, dactylium, or penicillium on a petri dish.  You can also get copper powder.  Perhaps a copper screen such as is used in data centers for rf isolation could be laid on top of the casing layer to prevent mold spores from germinating?  The copper itself might also be harmful to the mushrooms or people, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the safest way to help control molds is to keep your casing surface at a ridiculously high Ph.  A salt shaker could be used to sprinkle hydrated lime right on the &lt;i&gt;surface&lt;/i&gt; where mold spores land, but where the mycelium hasn't colonized yet.  Good luck.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5819680</prev>\n<first>5819131</first>\n<last>5820420</last>\n<when>1152048293</when>\n<utime>07/05/06 12:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
