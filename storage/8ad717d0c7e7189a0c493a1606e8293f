You'll send up so many spores your house will be a mess to try to grow in.  In fact, I had a substrate block with some trich on the bottom that I didn't notice untill a week or two later. Two months later, I'm still fighting trich that shows up in my cultures and grain jars, and that's after running my flowhood for an hour before I start work.  <br />Always toss out green on sight.  You battle trich before it grows by providing good air exchange.<br />RR"}}
