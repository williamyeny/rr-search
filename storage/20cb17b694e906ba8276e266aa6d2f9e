Peat fits the bill perfectly.  Verm helps to hold water, but has poor texture.  That's why a combination of peat and vermiculite makes an excellent casing recipe.  Coir is very nutritious for fungi, providing nearly as much food as horse manure, and more than many other bulk substrate materials such as straw.<br />Some growers use a small amount of coir in casing recipes, but I choose not to.  Other growers use as much as 40% coir to 60% vermiculite and still have good results, but initiation timing becomes critical.<br />Vermiculite by itself is probably the worst choice for a casing layer, due to the poor texture.<br />The above casing layer is not overlayed.  Overlay is matted mycelium that is impervious to moisture.  Initiate fruiting, if you haven't done so already.<br />RR"}}
