Where injection can help is if the substrate &lt;i&gt;below&lt;/i&gt; the casing gets too dry.  Just inject 2cc into each of half a dozen spots around the substrate.  If you inject slowly, the water will stay where you put it.  2cc isn't going to make a geyser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Injection is also a benefit if your pf cakes are too dry during a flush.  An injection can hold them over until after the flush when you can dunk.  Just don't overdo it.  You don't want a waterlogged cake or bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5845222</next>\n<prev>5844695</prev>\n<first>5844656</first>\n<last>5845222</last>\n<when>1152596411</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 08:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
