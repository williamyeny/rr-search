I've grown on 100% spent coffee grinds, as have many growers.  It's an excellent substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly, your substrate is too wet.  Field capacity in a bulk substrate means no more than several drops should squeeze out when you take a handfull and squeeze very hard.  If a small stream runs out, make sure it stops within a second or two.  Otherwise, it's too wet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7137983</next>\n<prev>7137921</prev>\n<first>7137874</first>\n<last>7166569</last>\n<when>1183758195</when>\n<utime>07/07/07 12:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
