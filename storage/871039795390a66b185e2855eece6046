Your cakes might have been contaminated with bacteria, or they might just be slow to pin, or if multispore inoculation, there's always the slight chance of a non fruiting strain.  I'd dunk again overnight and put them back in.  Make sure you're not setting the cakes directly on the perlite.<br />Fanning is good, even with all the holes.  The holes also tend to <i>increase</i> humidity rather than the other way around by drawing air up from below the perlite.<br />RR"}}
