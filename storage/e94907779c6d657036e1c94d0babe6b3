So instead of chucking them can i possibly make mycelium syringes, or collect all the mycelium and make a mixed casing</blockquote><br />No.&nbsp; <br />The uncolonized parts will soon contaminate, and it's awfully hard to remove it all.&nbsp; When substrate doesn't colonize, there's always a reason.&nbsp; If it's not due to lack of gas exchange, then either your substrate is contaminated with bacteria or the mycelium is too weak.&nbsp; Regardless, it's the trash can tek and time to start over with fresh substrate and spores.<br />RR"}}
