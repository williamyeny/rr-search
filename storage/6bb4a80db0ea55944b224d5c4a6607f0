Higher won't help the mushroom mycelium any and it will encourage competitor molds and bacteria.  I don't own an incubator and haven't used one in years.  I incubate all jars on a shelf at normal room temperature, also exposed to normal room lighting from day one.  Quart jars of rye are fully colonized in two weeks at 75F.  Any temperature over 80F will result in a higher contamination rate with little decrease in colonization time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4762556</next>\n<prev>4762084</prev>\n<first>4760109</first>\n<last>4762556</last>\n<when>1128590492</when>\n<utime>10/06/05 12:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
