Even then, it's 'iffy'.&amp;nbsp; I always toss out contaminated substrates immediately on sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original poster needs to bury that thing in his yard.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13771611</next>\n<prev>13771266</prev>\n<first>13753610</first>\n<last>13792253</last>\n<when>1294805116</when>\n<utime>01/12/11 06:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
