Potency seems to be genetic in nature, and not related to some chemical that is added to the substrate, and trust me, I've added everything under the sun and the result with isolated, proved strains was always exactly the same.  No change.  If you do a 'search posts' in advanced mycology, you'll find dozens of threads, but not one single substantiated test that anything has increased potency.  It's all talk, and simply repeating what people have read, which is not science.<br />RR"}}
