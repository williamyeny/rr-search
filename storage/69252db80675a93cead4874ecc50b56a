Three to five inches of rinsed and well drained perlite will provide humidity in the upper nineties.  Drill holes in all six sides.  Be sure to put spacers under it so air can circulate all the way around.  You want air percolating up from the bottom, because it will be drawn into the low pressure air in the chamber, via the perlite and it will be humidified as it travels through the perlite.<br />The theory of operation is that air currents travel from high pressure to low, or cold to warm, thus air will be drawn up through the cool, moist perlite and into the slightly warmer air in the terrarium itself, providing constant circulation.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/287245516-thumb_Terrarium_2a.jpg\"></a>"}}
