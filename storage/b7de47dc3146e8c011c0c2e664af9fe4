Look, tape up all but 2 or 3 of those big ass holes in ur fc and put it buy a sunny window for 1 or 2 hours and watch that gauge go way up and ull see that all those holes kill the humidity. Dont worry about fae cause u can still take off the lid and fan it 2 to 3 times a day. Sometimes u just need to see for ur self man, and 100 people telling u what to do is no substitute for a little experiance. So take 2 hours out of ur day tommorow and ull see whats what. Not trying to piss anybody off I just know cause Ive used that same jug several times in the past. Just try it man for real.</blockquote><br />Unfortunately, your knowledge of physics matches your spelling and grammar skills.&nbsp; Taping holes in a properly made shotgun terrarium reduces humidity and fresh air, both of which are very important.<br />Telling someone that fanning 2 to 3 times a day will in any way match the performance of constant fresh air leads one to wonder if you've actually grown your first mushroom yet.&nbsp; One would have to fan 2 to 3 times per hour to achieve the natural air exchange that a shotgun terrarium delivers.<br />The OP's problem is a bad hygrometer, probably a made in china piece of shit from walmart. No amount of 'fixing' the terrarium is going to satisfy a defective hygrometer.&nbsp; That is like changing the oil on your car because it has a flat tire.<br />RR"}}
