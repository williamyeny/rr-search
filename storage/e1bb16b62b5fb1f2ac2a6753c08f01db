You want the rye berries to look dry when you're finished.  Any visible moisture will eventually run down the sides due to gravity and pool up in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I soak for 24 hours, bring to a boil for five minutes, then drain into a strainer while still boiling.  Let the rye drain for a few minutes, then toss the grains around in the strainer so steam can evaporate the excess moisture off the outside of the kernels.  When the grains have dried on the outside, load jars.  If the kernels are twice the size they were when dry, you have enough moisture inside. There is no need to boil until you see busted kernels.  I add gypsum to the soaking water.  This helps keep the grains from sticking together later.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also important to rinse the grains very well before the soak.  Fill up a large kettle with the grains and water and mix them well.  Drain off the water and repeat three or four times until you pour off clear water.  This rinse gets rid of the grain dust that will cause clumping later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a pic of two colonizing rye jars with the correct moisture content. Pan cyan on the left, cube on the right. You'll see there is no visible moisture on the sides of the jars or around where the kernels touch, nor is there any burst kernels.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-17/627178716-Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-17/627178716-thumb_Rye_jar_ready_to_shake.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5594034</next>\n<prev>5593815</prev>\n<first>5593815</first>\n<last>5594034</last>\n<when>1146852906</when>\n<utime>05/05/06 09:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
