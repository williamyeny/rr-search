Most squirrel cage motors have the labled CFM determined at 1&quot;.  Filters range from .8 to 1.25 or so.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on that, your 465 CFM blower will give just over 200 linear feet per minute of 'airspeed' leaving your blower.  That is fine, if not a bit too much.  If you have a bit of excess airflow, you can either get a motor speed controller, or simply block off part of the intake, or even use a prefilter to restrict the volume of air.  The correct airflow will be achieved when you can light a cigarette lighter in front of the hood and it bends the flame over 90 degrees, but doesn't blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5450846</next>\n<prev>5449680</prev>\n<first>5448502</first>\n<last>5494896</last>\n<when>1143567143</when>\n<utime>03/28/06 07:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
