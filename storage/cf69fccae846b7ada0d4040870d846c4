What will happen is all the humidity you are trying to put into the terrarium will be lost to condensation on the walls due to the temperature differential.  I'd skip the heating pads, etc., and get a space heater or other such device to heat the entire area.  You'll have far fewer problems.  Cubes will fruit very well at 68 to 70F.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5221893</next>\n<prev>5221569</prev>\n<first>5221408</first>\n<last>5221893</last>\n<when>1138219314</when>\n<utime>01/25/06 10:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
