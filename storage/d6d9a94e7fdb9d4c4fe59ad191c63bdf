I think it's a mistake to let jars sit after sterilization unless you never plan to use them.  The sterilization process gives you a three to four week window of opportunity to get the grains colonized.  To 'completely' sterilize a jar of rye would take 24 hours in the PC and would turn the grains to mush.<br />By the way, the endospores are bacterial.  Mold spores are killed by fairly low temps, so if your contamination problem is green, then it's being introduced after sterilization.<br />RR"}}
