Rough percentages I just use my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have meant to ask about layering, is there a knack to it? I basically just keep them all very thin, first substrate then spawn, just enough spawn to cover the previous sub layer, until I reach the top. Last layer a bit thicker substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the way to do it.&amp;nbsp; Disregard anyone who says layering is outdated.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium in the grain layer re-knits together first and then takes off into the substrate with a vengeance. For this reason, it's better to have fewer, but thicker grain layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've done mixing and layering thousands of times each.&amp;nbsp; With spawn bags, one must shake, so by nature it's well mixed.&amp;nbsp; With trays of manure or other bulk substrates we have the luxury of layering.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to always cover with a layer of substrate on top so there are no exposed grains, as you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the rest of you, please quit 'jacking the thread.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19464188</next>\n<prev>19463673</prev>\n<first>19463064</first>\n<last>19478796</last>\n<when>1390528394</when>\n<utime>01/24/14 03:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
