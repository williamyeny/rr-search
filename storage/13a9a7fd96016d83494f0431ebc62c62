{"key":"post-6265557","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6265557</id>\n<content>I mounted fluorescent fixtures to the wall behind the greenhouse, after first putting adhesive, foil backed foam on the wall.  The foil reflects the light from the fluorescents through the plastic on the greenhouse making it much brighter.  This also keeps the lights out of the moist air.  You don't want a fluorescent ballast inside the greenhouse.  They develop up to 500 volts, so don't mix well with moisture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6265288</prev>\n<first>6263907</first>\n<last>6265557</last>\n<when>1163104500</when>\n<utime>11/09/06 10:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
