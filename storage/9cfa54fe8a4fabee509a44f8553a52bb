I read trich comes off when wiped.&amp;nbsp; Out of 6 cakes only 1 is doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The qtip test is invalid because bruising will often show on the qtip as well.&amp;nbsp; That's mutant mushroom tissue, most frequently caused by not waiting a full week &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; full colonization before birthing the cakes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cause is failure to expose the cakes to a day/night lighting schedule during the colonization phase.&amp;nbsp; People who use 'incubators' that keep the jars in the dark have a higher incidence of these mutant forms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10095113</prev>\n<first>10081099</first>\n<last>10095243</last>\n<when>1238708309</when>\n<utime>04/03/09 12:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
