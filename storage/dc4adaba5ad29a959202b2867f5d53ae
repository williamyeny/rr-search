From the sounds of it, you just want to combine strains of the same species.  They may or may not share genetics(cross), but either way there is little to no harm in mixing vendor named strains because they're all the same species anyway.  The chances are very high that they will combine into a single organism via anastomosis by the time fruiting comes.  Search the posts.  This has been asked and answered dozens of times in the last year or two.  There's several grow logs in that forum where guys have mixed 'strains' in the same tray with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6475878</next>\n<prev>6475844</prev>\n<first>6475694</first>\n<last>6479255</last>\n<when>1169223713</when>\n<utime>01/19/07 06:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
