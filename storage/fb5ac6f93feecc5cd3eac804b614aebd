Jars are tall enough not to matter.  For petris, just keep them in a stack and only open the top one.  I only use soap and water in my gloveboxes and after cleaning, leave the floor damp.  This helps to hold down anything that might settle there.<br />A rack is a good idea too.  I use one in front of the flowhood when working with petris to get them into the middle of the flow, so I have laminar flow under the dishes as well as around and over them.<br />RR"}}
