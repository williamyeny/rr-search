A sterilized substrate is almost certain to contaminate with the green prior to full colonization.   For straw and manure, I stick to the low end of the scale at 140F-150F.  It seems to work much better.  Trich spores are killed by one hour at 120F, so there is no need to go even to 180F.<br />RR"}}
