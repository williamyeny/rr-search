Heating it up for a few minutes to about 150-160F and letting it sit at that temp for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to take a lot more than a few minutes for the center of the substrate to reach 150F.&amp;nbsp; In fact, in large filter patch bags, it will take about an hour for temperature to be reached.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you weren't measuring water temp. You want to measure temp in the center of the bag of substrate, and then hold 140F to 160F for one full hour after temperature is reached.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11310785</next>\n<prev>11310714</prev>\n<first>11310714</first>\n<last>11315385</last>\n<when>1256397491</when>\n<utime>10/24/09 06:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
