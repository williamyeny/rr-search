I read in the above mentioned book that brown rice flour makes the mushrooms considerably more potent than rye berries: &quot;Up to 1% alkaloid content by dry weight.&quot; Why would you use rye berries then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. This book also mentions pasteurized horse manure as a casing. I thought manure was supposed to be a substrate, NOT a casing? And even if you can use it as a casing, why over-complicate things? In other words, what's wrong with vermiculite or peat moss? *shrug*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm confused by the whole thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, you just read it wrong.  I've never read the book, but if it says that brf produces more potent mushrooms than grains, it's full of shit.  Potency is genetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I hope you just read it wrong, because horse manure is a substrate, never a casing.  It would be hard to imagine someone publishing a book without submitting it for peer review prior to printing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7942884</prev>\n<first>7934836</first>\n<last>7942968</last>\n<when>1201495822</when>\n<utime>01/28/08 06:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
