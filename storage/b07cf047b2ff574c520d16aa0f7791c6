Molds are killed off by temps around 130F, and most live bacteria is killed off by 180F, so even a few microwave grows have succeeded.  However, anyone who owns an oven, usually has a stovetop to boil/steam the jars, which is the tried and true way that can achieve 100% success, but there's nothing wrong with experimentation.<br />RR"}}
