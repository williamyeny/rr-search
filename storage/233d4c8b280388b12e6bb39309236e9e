Water will NOT exist in a liquid state above 100C without being under pressure.  Don't give me the silly little 'distilled water in a pyrex glass in the microwave thingie', because I've already seen that trick.  We're talking water that has rye or brf in it.  That is hardly distilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, mason jars are meant to hold vacume, not pressure.  The lids will vent no matter how tight you make them because they will warp to let the steam out.  This is done to make the jars safe for little old ladies who tighten the lids too much when making jam.  You can't sterilize in the oven.  If you think so, do it and show us the mushrooms you grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, read my original post.  The part that is in italics.  I have no idea what an ing is, but as an engineer, I know water can't exist in a liquid state without pressure.  What about that is wrong and what book do I need to read?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5641949</next>\n<prev>5641726</prev>\n<first>5640554</first>\n<last>5649231</last>\n<when>1147892862</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 10:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
