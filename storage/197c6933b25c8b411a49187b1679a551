So you think my issue isnt the no soak/simmer tek but the way I run my PC with the weight on from turn on to shut off?</blockquote><br />That's exactly why you fail.<br />You are building 15 psi of air pressure. What you want is 15 psi of steam pressure.&nbsp; This means you have to leave the weight off for a few minutes after you see steam venting.&nbsp; This gets rid of all the air in the pressure cooker, ensuring the entire area is saturated with steam.&nbsp; At this point put the weight on to build pressure.<br />The method of simply putting grains and water in a jar to pressure cook is how we did it for decades.&nbsp; We also had to deal with clumpy grains, a higher fail ratio, and slower colonization due to all the grain dust and dirt.&nbsp; It isn't however the source of your contamination-that's your incorrect pressure cooker operation.<br />RR"}}
