It will be a moldy mess when you open the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manure will dry just fine in cold weather.  I'd spread it out in the sun/rain until you're ready to use it.  After it's totally dry, you can put it into paper bags for storage indoors.  There will be no smell.  I'm still using dried manure I collected three years ago, and it still works as well as the day I collected it from the field(already aged).&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7760971</prev>\n<first>7760749</first>\n<last>7761087</last>\n<when>1197730309</when>\n<utime>12/15/07 04:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
