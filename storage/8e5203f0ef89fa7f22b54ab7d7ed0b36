Also, drill a few holes around the bottom near the level of the top of the perlite.  If you have two to three inches of damp, but not wet perlite and no standing water, you can easily maintain 99% humidity even with openings for air exchange.  It's not only ok, but actually desired to have the casing layer begin to dry out a little between mistings.  A constant rate of evaporation from the substrate is a major pinning trigger.<br />Lack of air exchange is a major cause of molds such as trichoderma.  You should always assume that contaminant mold spores are going to be landing on your project.  There is nothing you can do about it.  It's a fact of growing.  The key is not to provide an environment in which they can germinate and grow.  Molds such as trich and cobweb thrive in stale, still, humid air.  Fresh, moving air is good for mushrooms and death to molds.<br />RR"}}
