The holes should be on all six sides, and the sides of the tub need to be clear. In addition, I've posted dozens of times that blocking holes in a shotgun defeats the purpose.&amp;nbsp; Not only does it LOWER humidity, it cuts down on fresh air(number ONE pinning trigger).&amp;nbsp; Your hort dome gets FAR more light than that opaque tub.&amp;nbsp; Once you birth the cakes, bright light becomes a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; You don't get that in a blue tub.&amp;nbsp; In fact, light in the 'blue' spectrum tends to produce the best pinsets, and a blue tub absorbs exactly the spectrum you want for your fruiting cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, fresh air exchange causes a desired loss of moisture from the substrate, which is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; You must mist the cakes directly to replace this lost moisture for best results.&amp;nbsp; The perlite will get plenty of mist from the overspray, but it is the cakes themselves that need to be misted.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10264781</prev>\n<first>10263564</first>\n<last>10265114</last>\n<when>1241142741</when>\n<utime>05/01/09 04:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
