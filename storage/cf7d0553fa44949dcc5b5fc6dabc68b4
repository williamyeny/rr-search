That was healthy mycelium you killed.  Cobweb mold is EXTREMELY rare in pf cakes.  Dactylium is a contaminant of casing layers, especially peat based. It's also grey, not white.<br />I'd recommend washing them under the faucet, and then dunking for at least a few hours in plain water.  Perhaps that will help mitigate some of the damage the peroxide did.<br />RR"}}
