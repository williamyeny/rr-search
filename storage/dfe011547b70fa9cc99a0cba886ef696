If you can't get perlite, you can use several layers of damp paper towels in the bottom to get humidity, but be sure to change them out every two or three days to avoid them getting mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lay a sheet of wax paper over the top of your tray.  Wrinkle it up into a ball first, then flatten it back out and lay it on.  The wrinkles will provide passages for air, while holding in the humidity right at the surface where you need it.  Replace the sheet of wax paper with a new one every two days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6640657</next>\n<prev>6640581</prev>\n<first>6640393</first>\n<last>6642998</last>\n<when>1173194268</when>\n<utime>03/06/07 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
