Calibrate or replace the guage.  Personally, for a tub/terrarium, I'd skip the idea of a fan and simply leave the lid on at a slight angle so it constantly has a bit of free air exchange due to the poor fit.  Don't worry about trying to maintain any sort of sterility in there. It isn't necessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5209307</next>\n<prev>5206213</prev>\n<first>5205806</first>\n<last>5209307</last>\n<when>1137870231</when>\n<utime>01/21/06 09:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
