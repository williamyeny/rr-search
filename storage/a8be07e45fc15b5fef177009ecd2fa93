If that isn't good enough, go elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because some pimply faced school-kid hasn't learned what we have so he can write a 'paper' for his teacher, doesn't negate my decades of actual experience and a few million pounds of mushroom production.&amp;nbsp; It also doesn't negate the experiences of thousands of growers who have followed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek#lighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;lighting requirements of mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; and reported substantially increased yields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; energy if you didn't know.&amp;nbsp; If something uses energy and gets bigger, it's deriving energy.&amp;nbsp; It's not a tough concept.&amp;nbsp; Light is energy.&amp;nbsp; Calories are a measure of energy.&amp;nbsp; Give your mushrooms light and they get bigger and supply more calories when you eat them.&amp;nbsp; Therefore light is being used as a direct source of energy.&amp;nbsp; It's not a &lt;i&gt;reaction&lt;/i&gt;, which is what happens when a leaf or mushroom cap physically turns to orient itself toward the light.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19506828</next>\n<prev>19503258</prev>\n<first>19499183</first>\n<last>19527880</last>\n<when>1391261235</when>\n<utime>02/01/14 03:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
