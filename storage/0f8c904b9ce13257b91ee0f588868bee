Look at the above picture before  added the water.  The edges were curled up from being too dry.  I haven't seen that before from dishes that were less than several months old.  I will consider when growth of both organisms stopped and the dish became totally dry as the end of the experiment.  I know that dry reishi mycelium will start growing again after at least two years.  I don't know how long the contaminant would remain viable.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4040000</next>\n<prev>4010301</prev>\n<first>3941617</first>\n<last>7855221</last>\n<when>1112729339</when>\n<utime>04/05/05 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
