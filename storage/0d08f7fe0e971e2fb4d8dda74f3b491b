In commercial HVAC systems, a varicone is commonly used to regulate airflow, thus keeping the building at the correct static pressure.&nbsp; If static pressure is too high, the doors don't close, if too low, dirt enters the building.&nbsp; However, the blower motor runs at the same speed all the time and the intake is blocked to control pressure.&nbsp; You can test this yourself.&nbsp; Block part of the intake on a blower while&nbsp; a clamp-on ammeter is around one of the motor leads.&nbsp; You'll see a decrease in current.<br />To BEEP, it sounds like you didn't build your plenum large enough.&nbsp; If the same pressure is exerted across the back of the filter, the flow will be even out the front.<br />RR"}}
