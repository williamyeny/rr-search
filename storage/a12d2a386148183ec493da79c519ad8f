We use the refrigerator to dunk in because organic matter under water at room temperature will grow bacteria in a matter of hours, ruining your project.  The cold isn't the best thing for the crop, but it recovers from the cold much easier than getting over a case of bacterial contamination.  It isn't 'cold shocking' per se, because tropicals such as cubensis don't need that.  Cold shocking is for temperate edible species that fruit in the fall after cold weather sets in.<br />The dunk is to get your substrate up to it's maximum moisture content just before fruiting so it can sustain a larger crop.  Once you remove the cakes from the dunking water and place in fruiting conditions, they will pin, but remember, they pin on their own schedule rather than yours, so be patient.  Have fun.<br />RR"}}
