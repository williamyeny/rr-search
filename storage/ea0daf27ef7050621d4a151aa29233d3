Fruit size is generally related to moisture content, so it sounds like you let them dry out early and they've never recovered.  Once you get behind the curve, it's hard to get caught up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every multispore grow has different genetics, so it's a roll of the dice whether you get a good strain or not, which could be a factor too. Your casing layer looks very uneven, so technique played a big part too.  Laying wax paper over the top of a cased or uncased substrate at primordia formation time helps greatly to get a good, even pinset.  After that, you have to pour a lot of water to them to get a good crop.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6842790</prev>\n<first>6791192</first>\n<last>6843047</last>\n<when>1177730960</when>\n<utime>04/28/07 06:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
