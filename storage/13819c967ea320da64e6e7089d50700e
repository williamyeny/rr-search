Mycelium takes forever to colonize down from the top.  If you just made it, I'd suggest mixing it all up, verm and all.  Then cover with foil and place on a shelf for a week or two to colonize the horse manure.  When it's fully colonized, you can fruit it as is by removing the foil and placing into fruiting conditions, or add a casing layer which is optional.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5672043</next>\n<prev>5672022</prev>\n<first>5671874</first>\n<last>5686169</last>\n<when>1148570839</when>\n<utime>05/25/06 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
