Get your stuff to field capacity then load your jars.  Tyvek or whatever can be put on them if you're not going to use them right away.  Put them in the PC or other large kettle with a good sealing lid.  Fill COLD water two thirds of the way up the jars.  If the jars try to float, put a plate or some other weight on them.  Turn on the stove and bring to a boil.  Remember, glass is an insulator so the heat won't immediately transfer.  Allow the water to boil for five minutes, then just shut off the stove.  If using a large, thick kettle, that's all you have to do.  With a smaller pot, you might need to turn on the stove again in half an hour for a few minutes.  Using a thermometer the first few times will help you work out the routine to follow.  Keep the center of the jars or bags above 140 for an hour, but try to keep it below 170 at all times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5726811</prev>\n<first>5726757</first>\n<last>5728619</last>\n<when>1149824511</when>\n<utime>06/09/06 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
