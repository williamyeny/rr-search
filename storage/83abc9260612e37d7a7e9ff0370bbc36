I've seen a few cakes hanging from twine and they had fruits over the whole surface.   I doubt it increased yield any because the more fruits you get on a small substrate, the smaller they will all be.  It looked cool though.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6077048</prev>\n<first>6076008</first>\n<last>6077132</last>\n<when>1158674675</when>\n<utime>09/19/06 05:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
