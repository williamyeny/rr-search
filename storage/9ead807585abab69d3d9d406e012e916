They don't need to be in the water at all.  I use two layers of old jar lid rings between the bottom of the kettle and the jars.  This way they're completely out of the water, so no water gets in.  Begin counting time when steam is clearly escaping the lid when using this method, not just when the water boils.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6478906</next>\n<prev>6478814</prev>\n<first>6478777</first>\n<last>6478924</last>\n<when>1169280062</when>\n<utime>01/20/07 10:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
