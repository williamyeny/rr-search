{"key":"post-6141317","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6141317</id>\n<content>Sorry, the 5 square feet was a brain fart.  However, 300 cfm won't cut it due to the losses involved.  My flowhood is 2 square feet and has a 650 cfm blower that is barely enough.  Add the extra 1/3 surface area, and it works out to 750 cfm to get the same speed I have which will bend the flame of a bic lighter over 45 to 90 degrees, but not blow it out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I had too many things going on at once as I typed earlier and got sidetracked.  I still stand by the 750 cfm.  You can get one from Grainger for around $150.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6141319</next>\n<prev>6141294</prev>\n<first>6140801</first>\n<last>7038731</last>\n<when>1160181560</when>\n<utime>10/07/06 03:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
