The white, milky slime you see is bacteria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't consider glass petri dishes useful for mycology at all.  The plastic dishes come 20 to a sleeve and presterilized.  You open the sleeve immediately before pouring the dishes.  As soon as they solidify, wrap with parafilm, not plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have far less problems with bacteria if you'll let the agar cool almost to room temperature before pouring.  Remember, as the agar cools, it shrinks which draws in air/contaminants to the petri dish.  Allow the filtered bottle of agar to cool until no heat protection is required for your hands.  This will cut down on condensation as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6102715</next>\n<prev>6102601</prev>\n<first>6101422</first>\n<last>6105956</last>\n<when>1159290731</when>\n<utime>09/26/06 08:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
