The only way your substrate could have reached 212F is to boil off 100% of the moisture within.  That is a fact.  Sterilization requires a higher temperature than 212F, so in no way were those jars sterilized.  Good luck with your project.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5974666</next>\n<prev>5974619</prev>\n<first>5974058</first>\n<last>5976819</last>\n<when>1155877291</when>\n<utime>08/18/06 08:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
