That's asking for broken jars due to the rapid temperature change.  Load the pc, add the cool water, seal, and <i>then</i> turn on the stove.  This ensures that everything heats evenly.<br />When the weight starts to rattle, turn down the stove until it doesn't rattle at all.  This should occur at about 14.5 psi, which is a great operating pressure. You'll have to re-adjust the stove a time or two because as the jars heat up, they'll absorb less heat. By not allowing the weight to rattle, water loss is reduced, allowing longer cycles if needed.   I use 90 minutes for rye in quart jars.<br />RR"}}
