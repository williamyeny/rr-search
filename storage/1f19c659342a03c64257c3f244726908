Once the fruits grow into small mushrooms, you can mist again, but be sure to up the air exchange so the fruits don't sit wet for any length of time or they abort.  You can currently use a syringe or something similar to carefully water the casing layer without getting the pins wet.<br />Coffee is an excellent substrate and it seems to help increase pinning quality, but I doubt it's the N content.  Perhaps the antioxidants?  You want to use spent coffee grinds in your substrate so you can't add it now.  Dunking in coffee is almost a sure recipe for green mold.  Grains can be soaked in weak liquid coffee prior to sterilization.<br />RR"}}
