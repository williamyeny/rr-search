However the ones that fruited would not only have been competing with spores of substrains of its strain but also spores of a whole strain all together. That means they are probably pretty strong. If you isolated and cloned one of them it would probably fair quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these comments are 100% incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, 'strains' of a commons species will easily 'mate' and do not meet the criteria for being called a hybrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes no difference to to the species whether the spores came from mushroom caps from different regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say otherwise is as incorrect as saying that a white woman from Europe who mates with a black man from Africa will have the genes 'compete' with each other and the child will be either white or black, but not a combination of the two.&amp;nbsp; It just simply doesn't work that way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15368616</next>\n<prev>15368595</prev>\n<first>15368560</first>\n<last>15376000</last>\n<when>1321291584</when>\n<utime>11/14/11 07:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
