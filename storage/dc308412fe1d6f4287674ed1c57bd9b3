A sterilized substrate is almost certain to contaminate with the green prior to full colonization.   For straw and manure, I stick to the low end of the scale at 140F-150F.  It seems to work much better.  Trich spores are killed by one hour at 120F, so there is no need to go even to 180F.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4510106</next>\n<prev>4510090</prev>\n<first>4509808</first>\n<last>4512131</last>\n<when>1123518810</when>\n<utime>08/08/05 07:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
