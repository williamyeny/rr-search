Wood is the favorite food of trichoderma.<br />An uncased substrate can give very large dense fruits too.  Cubensis certainly doesn't require a casing layer, as pf cakes prove well.  Texture is important in a casing layer because you want lots of little air pockets between the casing layer and the substrate.   These air pockets create little areas with 100% humidity, which stimulates primordia formation, and a good, loose texture also keeps air circulating around and within the casing, getting rid of the gasses, and replacing them with fresh air, which is another pinning trigger. A loose casing layer also allows light to penetrate, which is a third pinning trigger. A dense, or packed casing not only will not colonize well, but has none of these little air pockets that are so important, nor will it allow light to penetrate.  That's why you want a course, loose, fluffy casing.<br />RR"}}
