I may have over exagerated on the perlite haha. It's pretty well hydrated without water being visible. The perlite has absorbed all of the water. Thanks for the help&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perlite is crystalline and doesn't absorb water.&amp;nbsp; Rinse the perlite well, drain fully, and dump into the fruiting chamber.&amp;nbsp; Don't run a humidifier, except in the room the terrarium is located if necessary.&amp;nbsp; The proper calibration procedure is to wrap the hygrometer in a damp cloth towel for an hour, and then adjust to read 99%.&amp;nbsp; If it won't do that, it's crap.&amp;nbsp; In fact, even if you calibrate the chinese junk they're peddling on us, it won't stay calibrated for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13878295</next>\n<prev>13878184</prev>\n<first>13876001</first>\n<last>13878958</last>\n<when>1296436698</when>\n<utime>01/31/11 03:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
