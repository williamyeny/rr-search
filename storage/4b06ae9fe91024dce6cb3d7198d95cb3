If you can't find peat, Jiffy mix and sunshine mix #3 have both been used for casing layers.  Otherwise, just fruit your substrate uncased.  You can always dunk between flushes.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5738682</next>\n<prev>5738668</prev>\n<first>5738640</first>\n<last>5756598</last>\n<when>1150066177</when>\n<utime>06/12/06 01:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
