I read a post by Roger Rabbit and he said that he has seen substrate with contams in it effectively produce potent mushrooms.  Since the myc. content is MUCH greater that the green content I figured it may work. </blockquote><br />I think you misunderstood the post.  I've often said a substrate that gets a bit of green as the fruits are ready to harvest should be tossed out, but the fruits are safe to eat.<br />In your case, you spawned a contaminated jar to bulk substrate.  That is guaranteed to fail.  Sorry.<br />RR"}}
