But don't get mad if your jars get contaminated after being almost 80% colonized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to put them in the oven ....I'd suggest:&lt;br /&gt; placing lids on the bottom of a pot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; putting the jars in the pot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; filling the pot with water until it is a little past the base of the jars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN putting the jars in the oven&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you hear the water in the pot that is inside of your oven boiling start your 90 minute count down...Keep the oven at 250f by the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^ Everyone just sort of skipped over that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically if the guy REALLY wanted to put it in the oven.... I mean...he could put the jars in a pot of water like mentioned by me earlier (that no one seemed to acknowledge)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not going to work out either.&amp;nbsp; First of all, air is a horrible heat transfer mechanism.&amp;nbsp; It would take hours to heat the pot of water and jars using a 250F oven.&amp;nbsp; Then, once the water boiled, what do you suspect will happen to the steam which is at 212F when it contacts the sides of the pot at 250F?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take advantage of superheating in my wood fired steam boiler, but it's also a sealed unit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16285561</next>\n<prev>16285160</prev>\n<first>16284779</first>\n<last>16287867</last>\n<when>1338004606</when>\n<utime>05/26/12 06:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
