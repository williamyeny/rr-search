If you use a fridge that way, be sure to only have the cool side in your grow area. You can also lower the temp and increase humidity by placing a wet towel over a box fan. A coolmist humidifier will also slightly lower the temperature by evaporation. You can get a cycle timer and lots of other grow room goodies here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4681179</next>\n<prev>4680612</prev>\n<first>4680482</first>\n<last>4779600</last>\n<when>1127114809</when>\n<utime>09/19/05 10:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
