You want to use a thermometer stuck into the center of the casing mixture, and that thermometer needs to read 140F to 170F for an hour to an hour and a half.  That would probably take three hours or more in the oven, thus drying out the mixture.  I'd recommend using quart jars and pasteurizing in a large kettle or PC.  Just use a thermometer stuck into one of the jars and be sure to maintain pasteurization temps for that amount of time.  <br />Also, don't bother measuring your water.  Add water until your casing mixture is at field capacity, then pasteurize.<br />RR"}}
