I put a towel down between the two rubbermaids for extra insulation to keep the floor from drawing the heat out.  Put both lids on top with a towel between them for insulation as well.  This should keep the water hot during the entire pasteurization cycle.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3963861</next>\n<prev>3961667</prev>\n<first>3961449</first>\n<last>3963861</last>\n<when>1111665112</when>\n<utime>03/24/05 01:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
