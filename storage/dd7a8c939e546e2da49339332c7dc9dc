Besides, mold spores are killed by temps above 135F, so allowing them to germinate is a non-issue.&nbsp; Your problem was sterile procedure during or after inoculation.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>penhed said:</strong><br />use worm castings...has the nitrogen boost you want plus benefical microbes...which are contam fighters</blockquote><br />Worm castings are in no way, shape, or form the equal of coffee grinds as a food source for fungi, and it's not just about nitrogen. There are many other compounds as well in a good supplement, coffee having over 200.&nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants.&nbsp; Disregard NPK when dealing with fungi.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>anonjon said:</strong><br />Depends on the species. I'm not a big fan of it for cubensis. The gourmet growers use it more.</blockquote><br />Small amounts of spent coffee grinds of the nature of 5% to 10% will increase yields by 25% or more.&nbsp; Commercial growers may be more successful at making it work then cubensis growers because of their higher level of experience and attention to detail, coupled with a refusal to cut corners.<br />Advising one to avoid coffee grinds despite the benefits, is like telling a kid to keep his tricycle forever because switching to a bicycle might cause him to skin his knees as he learns something new and more challenging.<br />RR"}}
