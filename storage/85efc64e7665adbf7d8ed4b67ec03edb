Bleach works due to its high Ph, but hydrated lime works better.   Use one cup of hydrated lime per ten gallons of 140F to 170F pasteurization water for an hour to an hour and a half.  Drain well and use.  Don't squeeze the water out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6209524</prev>\n<first>5268507</first>\n<last>6209652</last>\n<when>1161777856</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 03:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
