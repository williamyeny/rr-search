To anyone who can't grasp this simple fact, I apologize.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thread has gone on long enough.&amp;nbsp; I thought if it was kept open, those who had trouble grasping this most basic fact of physics 101 could learn, but apparently not.&amp;nbsp; Sorry. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11616609</prev>\n<first>11604701</first>\n<last>11616689</last>\n<when>1260386976</when>\n<utime>12/09/09 09:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
