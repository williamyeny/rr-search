It's also open rangeland, so we have cows, llamas, and horses everywhere for free manure, not to mention deer, elk, bear and mountain lions to complete the experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be cutting a couple of mushroom caves into the side of our mountain over the winter.&amp;nbsp; A neighbor has a huge mining backhoe on tracks like a tank, but he can't operate in the area(septic drain field) until this winter when the ground freezes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna cost a bit more than $1500 though. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9011205</next>\n<prev>9011091</prev>\n<first>9010049</first>\n<last>25587528</last>\n<when>1222836551</when>\n<utime>10/01/08 07:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
