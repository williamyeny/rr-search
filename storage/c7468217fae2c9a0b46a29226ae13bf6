It's usually in the mid seventies, and in the summer approaches 80F.<br />Colonization will be faster at 80F to 82F as roadkill and hyphae suggested.  My problem with 'incubators' is they often spike much higher than that, which stimulates thermophilic molds and bacteria.  They also get very stale air inside unless fanned out regularly.  My open shelf colonization eliminates the stale air problem, and in the winter I run a small space heater in that area.  Just don't let the temps get above 83F and don't allow the air to be stale and you'll do fine.  As said above 69F is a bit cool, and while the jars will still colonize, they'll be slower.  Try to find a shelf a bit higher in the room.  Often a top bookshelf will be several degrees warmer than a low one.<br />RR"}}
