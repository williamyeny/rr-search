Mycelium does not germinate from spores and colonize a jar of rye berries in three days.  After three days, it's extremely rare to even SEE mycelium with the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you shake a jar, even if fully colonized, it takes 24 hours for the mycelium to knit back together.  Until then, the grains look uncolonized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever made that syringe had no idea what he or she was doing.  It's way too dark.  Dark is bad.  Fewer spores are better.  That is a fact.  A large number of spores is also going to have a large number of contaminants attached.  Using too many spores is counter productive.  That was known over twenty years ago when paul stamets wrote 'The Mushroom Cultivator' because he made that clear in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody needs to read about Amazon strain.  There is virtually no difference between cube strains regarding the rate of colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fully colonized jar should not smell like partially cooked rye.  it should smell like fresh mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spores are NOT large.  They are microscopic and invisible to the naked eye.  It requires a microscope to see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to do some serious reading before going further.  If that jar was inoculated by spores even FIVE days ago and is fully colonized, it is mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That looks like mold, not mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear enough?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6635955</next>\n<prev>6635940</prev>\n<first>6635109</first>\n<last>6636010</last>\n<when>1173071179</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 07:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
