{"key":"post-8432086","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8432086</id>\n<content>I'm working on a full-length book that will ship with an attached DVD in the front cover to give visual learners the chance to see it done.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we just bought a new home in the mountains, and right as we were in the process of moving, my website server crashed and burned, leaving me with no website.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/banghead.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:banghead:&quot; title=&quot;:banghead:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, relatives(shudder) are coming this weekend to visit, and mrs rabbit is insisting that I stop working on my website to hang curtains, mow the lawn, fix the sink, blah, blah. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:tongue:&quot; title=&quot;:tongue:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm working on my site, so if you're watching these videos and something goes wrong, it's probably because I broke something.&amp;nbsp; There's a few more of the video short clips posted on the website now, but you're likely to get kicked off the site everytime I add a new clip and hit 'update'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8432283</next>\n<prev>8431953</prev>\n<first>8429590</first>\n<last>9551491</last>\n<when>1211465250</when>\n<utime>05/22/08 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
