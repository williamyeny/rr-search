I'd use part of what you have left over from that to purchase or build a nice flowhood.  With what you have left over from the flowhood, get a box of 500 petri dishes and some agar supplies for that end of the hobby.  After that, a nice zoom microscope is great for identification of macroscopic qualities such as gill structures, and a lab microscope to check for contamination in your cultures. . .Wait, you said only $1000?<br />RR"}}
