Rye and wbs should really get 70 to 90 minutes @ 15 psi, and popcorn which is the worst choice by the way, 90 to 120 minutes.  BRF can work ok at 45 minutes, but it isn't normally used in quart jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6679111</next>\n<prev>6679087</prev>\n<first>6679087</first>\n<last>6679983</last>\n<when>1174117463</when>\n<utime>03/17/07 10:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
