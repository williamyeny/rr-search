(Excess coffee in the grain soak water can lead to invitro pins also)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you visit fp, you'll notice more than 10,000 square feet of colonization area for the spawn bags stamets sells, brightly lit by fluorescent fixtures for over 12 hours per day.&amp;nbsp; I've never counted a single pin in any of those bags.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8781561</next>\n<prev>8781465</prev>\n<first>8781465</first>\n<last>8785138</last>\n<when>1218899978</when>\n<utime>08/16/08 06:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
