A good IR scanner/camera can see the perfect outline of a man through over a foot of solid concrete from <i>his</i> heat sig.&nbsp; When I worked at microsoft, we had an IR camera for checking electrical connections, and it could read the label on our baseball hats from through two walls.&nbsp; They can see FAR more shit than they release in those pictures showing red around windows and chimneys and blue elsewhere.&nbsp; <br />Just a fyi in case you're growing and think they can't see your lights if they have reason to look.&nbsp; I know better.<br />RR"}}
