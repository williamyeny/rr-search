They'll warp, check your manual. AAs are probably about the only ones OK for direct flame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as they have water in them, they can't exceed the temperature of water at operating pressure, and this won't warp a pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; If the OP broke jars it was for some other reason such as popping the weight off at the end of the cycle, running out of water, or failure to use a trivet on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason cheapo PCs warn against using large propane burners is that if the blowout plug is released it won't let enough steam escape to prevent overpressure if the burner is at full level.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18438200</next>\n<prev>18437190</prev>\n<first>18436966</first>\n<last>18439201</last>\n<when>1371586856</when>\n<utime>06/18/13 11:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
