Here's a link that explains it further. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/envirohort/articles/misc/sphagnum.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.ext.vt.edu/department&lt;wbr&gt;s/envirohort/articles/misc/sphagn&lt;wbr&gt;um.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The calcium carbonate is used to raise the pH.  I prefer hydrated lime because it goes to work right away when you need it.  We don't lime for the mushroom mycelium, because it actually &lt;i&gt;prefers&lt;/i&gt; a slightly acid pH.  We lime because contaminant molds &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; a low ph, so by making it 7 or above, the casing layer favors mushroom mycelium over molds.   I'd suggest a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  That will get you into the ballpark without danger of making the casing too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6596241</next>\n<prev>6596012</prev>\n<first>6589562</first>\n<last>6596454</last>\n<when>1172124075</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 08:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
