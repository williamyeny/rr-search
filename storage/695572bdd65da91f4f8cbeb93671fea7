Forget the alcohol inside the glovebox, forget the fan and filter, but DON'T skip the flame sterilization.  That's like buying a car without an engine to make sure you don't get in a wreck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloveboxes need to be STILL, not sterile. Nobody dumps their brf or grains out on the floor of the glovebox.  Just use a clear tub with two arm holes cut in it.  Wear latex gloves.  Use an alcohol torch outside the glovebox to prevent condensation forming on the walls that make it hard to see.  While the needle or scalpel or inoculating loop is still red hot, bring it back into the glovebox.  As soon as your arm fills the hole, the air inside will instantly stop.  You can mist the inside of the box with water so that the floor is damp.  This will tend to keep any contaminants that settle to the floor right there where they land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want sterile air, you need a laminar flow hood.  A computer fan and filter, no matter what it says on the filter including the word hepa, won't work in a glovebox.  They will raise your contamination risk, not lower it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6909779</next>\n<prev>6909638</prev>\n<first>6908097</first>\n<last>6910042</last>\n<when>1179080743</when>\n<utime>05/13/07 09:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
