Unless you have something constructive to add to help me along the path I've chosen to take, just move on please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was attempting to be constructive, based on many failures over the years with just such a setup.&amp;nbsp; They don't get sufficient fresh air, and heating them causes condensation which gets the insulation wet, leading to mold. The lights create excess heat because they must be inside, yet fluorescent ballasts don't do well in high humidity because when they shut off and cool down, they draw in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being rude will get you nowhere around here.&amp;nbsp; You asked for help, so don't tell me to move on when I showed you the courtesy of replying to your question based on personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15870875</prev>\n<first>15870554</first>\n<last>15870963</last>\n<when>1330375817</when>\n<utime>02/27/12 10:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
