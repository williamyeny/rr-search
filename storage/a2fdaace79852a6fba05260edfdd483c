{"key":"post-8369064","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8369064</id>\n<content>I think you're incorrectly referring to a fruiting chamber as a 'casing'.  The problem stems from reading too many posts from those members who misuse the terminology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrarium/fruiting chamber should not be sealed up.  Drill  a few holes at least into it and fan several times per day.  Air exchange is the number one pinning trigger once full colonization of the substrate is reached.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want lots of fresh air, and near saturation humidity.  Fan and mist as required to achieve the above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8369196</next>\n<prev>8369050</prev>\n<first>8369034</first>\n<last>8369196</last>\n<when>1210105654</when>\n<utime>05/06/08 11:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
