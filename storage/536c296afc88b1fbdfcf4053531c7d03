The verm barrier will protect the contents from bacteria or other airborne contaminants.  The danger in inoculation is sticking a dirty needle through the verm barrier and into the substrate below.  The needle itself becomes the vector for contaminants.  Try placing the jar in the plastic bag along with a syringe that the needle has been flame sterilized.  Seal the bag while the needle is still red hot.  This amounts to using a large plastic bag as a glovebox.
