About five to ten minutes after the water begins to boil, steam starts escaping between the lid and the kettle.  At that point, turn down the stove to the &lt;i&gt;lowest&lt;/i&gt; setting that will keep the water boiling, and start your timer for 1 hour, not 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use two layers of jar lids and fill the water to the top of the top layer or even 1/4&quot; above it, you'll have plenty of water for the cycle.  Just remember to turn the stove down.  You also need a kettle with a very tight fitting lid.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6478906</prev>\n<first>6478777</first>\n<last>6478924</last>\n<when>1169282109</when>\n<utime>01/20/07 10:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
