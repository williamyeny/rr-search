It won't kill trich that is already established, only the spores.  Any outbreak of contamination, as dcyans said above must be tossed out.  Don't try to save a casing or cake with green mold.  It will only spread its spores and take out anything else you have going.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3010391</next>\n<prev>3007405</prev>\n<first>3005782</first>\n<last>3012446</last>\n<when>1092638456</when>\n<utime>08/16/04 09:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
