All you need to do after cleaning them out is wash with soap and water.  There's no need to use alcohol.  They'll be sterilzed before you inoculate the next batch.  Follow all instructions for sterilization, and don't cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6834203</prev>\n<first>6834203</first>\n<last>6834281</last>\n<when>1177555034</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 05:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
