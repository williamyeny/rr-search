The SGFC is meant to be used in rooms that have an RH above %30, anything below and you will run across humidity issues. Temperature can also cause problems. I could not get the humidity to stay consistent in my last project until I placed a small space heater in the room. I suspect that the increase in temperature caused more water to evaporate from the perlite and thusly raised the RH in the FC. Give it a try, it could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faulty reasoning.&amp;nbsp; A space heater in the room will &lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt; lower humidity, not raise it.&amp;nbsp; I'm certain your 'humidity problem' was exactly like 100% of the other members here, which is a &lt;i&gt;made in china &lt;del&gt;hygrometer&lt;/del&gt;(piece of crap)&lt;/i&gt;, a total waste of money and the leading cause of members trying over and over again to fix what isn't broken.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15430001</next>\n<prev>15428123</prev>\n<first>15427225</first>\n<last>18284219</last>\n<when>1322408627</when>\n<utime>11/27/11 05:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
