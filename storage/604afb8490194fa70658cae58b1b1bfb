In addition, pressure cooking bulk substrate materials kills off beneficial organisms that not only fight molds, but also help to stimulate pinning.  Even if it's 'named' a casing mix, 2 parts coir to one part verm is a substrate, not casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Substrates such as horse manure, cow manure, and coir should be pasteurized, and then covered with foil until full colonization prior to exposing to fruiting conditions.  That's why you're two weeks into it without seeing anything.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6897200</next>\n<prev>6896977</prev>\n<first>6896977</first>\n<last>12031365</last>\n<when>1178808674</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 05:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
