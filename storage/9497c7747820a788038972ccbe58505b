When you mist your cakes or other substrate, the excess mist falls on the perlite, keeping it hydrated as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to be losing moisture from your substrate.&amp;nbsp; You also want to be putting moisture back in.&amp;nbsp; The ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Anything you do to cut down on fresh air supply will make things worse not better.&amp;nbsp; I've colonized substrates in the mid 70s and fruited in the mid 90s without any problems at all.&amp;nbsp; Just remember to mist as required.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10942241</next>\n<prev>10942140</prev>\n<first>10941720</first>\n<last>10944826</last>\n<when>1251320364</when>\n<utime>08/26/09 11:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
