Chicken manure added to the substrate will give a few monsters.  When you open the bag, if it smells at all of ammonia, let it sit on your back porch in the sun and air for a few days until the smell goes away. This will work winter or summer, even in below freezing weather. Yes, mix it right in with the coir, hydrate and pasteurize at 140F to 160F for an hour to 90 minutes, but no longer than 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6614329</next>\n<prev>6613646</prev>\n<first>6613560</first>\n<last>6622205</last>\n<when>1172542789</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 04:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
