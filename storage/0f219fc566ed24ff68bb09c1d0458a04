Rinse, then while dripping wet, roll in dry vermiculite so it will stick by absorbing the moisture on the side of the cake. I do it by placing the cakes in a large bowl of vermiculite and sweeping the verm by hand over the cake that way. You want a solid layer of vermiculite covering the cake. <br />Once you've placed the cakes into the terrarium, mist heavily so that you completely soak and saturate the vermiculite.  It then becomes a moisture reservoir as well as a sort of mini-casing layer.<br />RR"}}
