If not, toss it now. Put some salt over any moldy spots that show up between now and harvest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, remember that attempting to cut out a sporulating mold only spreads it further by releasing all those spores into the air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19394178</next>\n<prev>19394166</prev>\n<first>19393785</first>\n<last>19394403</last>\n<when>1389305949</when>\n<utime>01/10/14 12:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
