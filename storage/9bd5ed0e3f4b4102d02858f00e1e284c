Normal incandescents are in the 3000K range, which is too low.  HPS is even worse, in the 2000K range.  You want light at the other end of the spectrum.  Cool white fluorescent is around 5000K and natural daylight fluorescent is 6500K, making it the best choice for the money.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6973604</prev>\n<first>6973604</first>\n<last>6973773</last>\n<when>1180295644</when>\n<utime>05/27/07 10:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
