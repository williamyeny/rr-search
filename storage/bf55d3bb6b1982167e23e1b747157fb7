There is nothing that will kill the former and spare the latter.&amp;nbsp; That would be like a rat poison that wouldn't also kill your dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still grow hundreds of pounds of mushrooms per week.&amp;nbsp; I toss out green substrates at first sight.&amp;nbsp; The other day I caught Mrs Rabbit picking shiitake off a substrate while one nearby had a small spot of trich.&amp;nbsp; She was going to wait until later to remove it.&amp;nbsp; Once she managed to extricate my boot from her ass, she promised to never make that mistake again. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14094744</next>\n<prev>14094577</prev>\n<first>14091761</first>\n<last>14096643</last>\n<when>1299726829</when>\n<utime>03/10/11 05:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
