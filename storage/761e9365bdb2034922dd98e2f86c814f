{"key":"post-6850136","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6850136</id>\n<content>No. I left the pf tek on the video and cut out other stuff to make room.  In a few months, I'll make a follow up dvd or even several.  I have enough stuff filmed for 4 or 5 more dvd's.  I had to cut out the basic mycology, microscopy, and contamination sections, as well as a whole section that covered the growing parameters of several species.  I also had to cut out the section on building mini-greenhouses.  There's only so much that will fit on a 120 minute dvd.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7088382</next>\n<prev>6850130</prev>\n<first>6849825</first>\n<last>7088514</last>\n<when>1177886427</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 01:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
