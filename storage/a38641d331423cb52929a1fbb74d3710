That's just the non-nutritive top layer that is over the substrate.  It's the &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt; that needs to get rested and recuperated prior to the next flush, not the casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you pick a flush, it's best to let the cased substrate sit idle for a few days without misting or anything else.  Let it just sit and dry out a bit.  During this time, the mycelium will 'rest' so to speak, so don't do anything to try to force it to fruit again.  After four or five days, you can soak the whole thing by filling the tray up with water, and either let it sit in water for a few hours, or preferably, allow the faucet to gently run into the tray, overflowing it for a few hours.  The running water is superior to still water because it hydrates the substrate better and also washes away contaminant spores that may be present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the soak period, you can fill in any divots you created while picking, but don't re-case the whole substrate.  Now, place back into fruiting conditions and watch the pins explode.  Crappy second flushes are often caused by trying to force a substrate right back into fruiting mode as soon as a flush is picked, which is bad procedure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6771265</next>\n<prev>6767864</prev>\n<first>6767434</first>\n<last>6782140</last>\n<when>1176179759</when>\n<utime>04/10/07 07:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
