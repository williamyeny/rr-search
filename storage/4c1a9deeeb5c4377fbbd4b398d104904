Respirators are designed to protect the wearer.  We don't require that in mycology.  What we need is to protect our projects from ourselves.  Surgical masks stop at least 99% of your exhaled bacteria.  Respirators, such as the N95 etc., are designed to protect doctors from their patient.  That isn't the use we're putting them to.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7509645</next>\n<prev>7509299</prev>\n<first>7508553</first>\n<last>7510348</last>\n<when>1192141042</when>\n<utime>10/12/07 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
