You can try fruiting this one uncased.  It won't do quite as well as a properly made and maintained casing layer, but it might help narrow down your problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you mean by a 'hot' pH?   You want your pH adjusted slightly sweet of neutral, 7.5 to 8.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7237935</next>\n<prev>7190153</prev>\n<first>7190153</first>\n<last>7372949</last>\n<when>1184729618</when>\n<utime>07/18/07 06:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
