I guess you could use more but i would rather spawn more poo with the other jars &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been around a long time, but I've never seen anything even remotely like that.  Let's keep things realistic please.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I've found that one to three will get a bit faster colonization and a jump on contaminants.  Also remember, the grains are a major portion of the nutrients available in the finished substrate, so skimping on spawn has a point of diminishing returns.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6663026</next>\n<prev>6662794</prev>\n<first>6662723</first>\n<last>24694350</last>\n<when>1173753857</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 05:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
