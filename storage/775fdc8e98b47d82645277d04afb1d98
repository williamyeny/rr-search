What will happen is a computer fan will create turbulence, which stirs the air that is already in the glovebox around, increasing contamination risk.  A still air glovebox works best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7662095</next>\n<prev>7662034</prev>\n<first>7662034</first>\n<last>7663429</last>\n<when>1195662890</when>\n<utime>11/21/07 06:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
