Second, make sure the watt rating on the pot matches the watts of the DC motor or you'll melt it.  If the potentiometer has solder terminals you should solder.  Many come with sta-con type connectors, so you'd crimp your wires to a connector and slide it on.  The bottom line is the connection has to be tight.  Solder will make a good tight connection.  Tape will only insulate, but not provide for good conductivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pot goes in series with the motor.  A 100K ohm pot has way too much resistance.  I'd look for a 150 ohm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7547299</next>\n<prev>7547088</prev>\n<first>7546726</first>\n<last>7547307</last>\n<when>1193086540</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 11:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
