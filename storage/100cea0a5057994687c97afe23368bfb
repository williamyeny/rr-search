Even if the jar on the outside is cool the middle might be hot and kill your spores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to scream whenever I see that sentence repeated.&amp;nbsp; How many times have you let a cup of coffee sit until it's cool, but the inside of the cup burns your mouth?&amp;nbsp; C'mon guys, if the jar is cool, the contents being wet, will be cool as well.&amp;nbsp; Water is a heat conductor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave quart jars of grains or even a stack of brf jars in the PC, they'll need overnight to cool fully. However, PF tek jars removed from the PC or kettle will be ready to inoculate when the jars are lukewarm to the touch.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said above, don't do anything to speed-cool the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8709847</next>\n<prev>8709598</prev>\n<first>8707431</first>\n<last>8710587</last>\n<when>1217562222</when>\n<utime>08/01/08 06:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
