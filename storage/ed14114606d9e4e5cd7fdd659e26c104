{"key":"post-7532252","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7532252</id>\n<content>I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; grumpy today. I'm sick with the flu. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mad2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mad2:&quot; title=&quot;:mad2:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; However, the boards are here to study and learn.&amp;nbsp; They're not here to spoon feed each and every step of the way to those with no desire to learn.&amp;nbsp; I've long recommended to every new grower to spend a few hours, reading back twenty to fifty pages in this forum.&amp;nbsp; If you'll do that, you will learn more in an afternoon than you could learn in a month of asking questions one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light is extremely important to good mushroom formation, and it's nothing to do with which way is up.&amp;nbsp; Gravity takes care of that function.&amp;nbsp; The post quoted above is only one of many times I've typed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is every time this question gets asked, people repeat the same 'stuff they've read' and thus if one of us fails to catch the misinformation, then somebody gets a grow compromised by using a desk lamp or some other less than desirable lighting source, rather than the best possible lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's enough confusing points in mushroom growing to keep a board like this busy forever. Ask about things you're not sure of, or of the details you don't understand &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; searching. However, for the basic questions, the answers are all right here at your fingertips.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to all.&amp;nbsp; I'll try to be less pissy.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7532301</next>\n<prev>7531752</prev>\n<first>7530819</first>\n<last>7532894</last>\n<when>1192749912</when>\n<utime>10/19/07 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
