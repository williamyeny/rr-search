{"key":"post-6833126","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6833126</id>\n<content>Your title says 'patching after fruiting' and your question asks if you should you 'patch before fruiting'.  Which is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fruiting, you can fill in the divots caused by picking, but don't re-patch the whole thing. Prior to fruiting, you can patch the first areas of mycelium to poke through, which helps to even out the pinset.  After patching, cover the tray up for a couple of days, then expose to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6832244</prev>\n<first>6830951</first>\n<last>6833126</last>\n<when>1177537820</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 12:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
