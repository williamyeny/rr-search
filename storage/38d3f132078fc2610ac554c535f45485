Cobweb mold will melt on contact and actually disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those corn jars are toast, so PC first if you want to open them and clean out for reuse, or simply toss them out, jar and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb IS mycelium, just of a different species than the mushroom mycelium you want.  It grows very fast and overwhelms the mushroom mycelium, killing it, or throwing it into dormancy.  Peroxide will kill Dactylium by melting it on contact if sprayed onto a casing layer, but it won't help with molds in jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6221607</next>\n<prev>6221266</prev>\n<first>6221266</first>\n<last>6222390</last>\n<when>1162072650</when>\n<utime>10/29/06 12:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
