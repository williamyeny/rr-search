{"key":"post-7887774","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7887774</id>\n<content>Mycobags are made of plastic and have a tyvek filter built in.  Look at them like a flexible jar, only larger.  Other names they're sometimes called are 'filter patch bags', 'spawn bags', 'gusseted poly bags', and a few others. 'Mycobags' don't colonize-what's inside them does. You'll still need to mix substrate and pressure cook.  If you don't have a pressure cooker, stick to 1/2 pint jars and the pf tek, even it that isn't what you wanted to hear.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7889740</next>\n<prev>7887756</prev>\n<first>7885187</first>\n<last>7889740</last>\n<when>1200504463</when>\n<utime>01/16/08 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
