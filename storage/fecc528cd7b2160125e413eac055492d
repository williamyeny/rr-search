Flat out wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You seriously need to read and study and not start a thread for every single question that pops into your head.  The members can help answer what you don't understand AFTER study, but this isn't a place to learn &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commercial growers use buffered peat and NO verm as casing.  Their income depends on growing as many mushrooms as they can for the money they spend to grow them.  Do you really think a multi-billion dollar industry is just throwing money away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read, search and study.  ALL the questions you're starting these threads lately for are already answered in detail, and available by a simple search, which is faster than typing a question.  Those who know these answers are sick and tired of typing the same stuff hundreds of times, over and over again, and aren't going to do it anymore.  Those who &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; know the answer will make something up just to take a wild guess, and the disinformation continues. . .&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7834922</next>\n<prev>7834839</prev>\n<first>7833452</first>\n<last>7842766</last>\n<when>1199552744</when>\n<utime>01/05/08 07:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
