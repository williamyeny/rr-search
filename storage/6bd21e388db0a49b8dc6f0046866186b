Time will tell if it's mold or mushroom mycelium.  You can increase your chances by taking much smaller samples when you clone.  The smaller the tissue, the less chance for contaminant spores to be on it. I usually clone pieces the size of a grain of rice or less.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7406059</next>\n<prev>7403528</prev>\n<first>7403528</first>\n<last>7415422</last>\n<when>1189735239</when>\n<utime>09/14/07 05:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
