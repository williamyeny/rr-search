Dry perlite does nothing for you. When it finishes draining, put it back in the FC, and then remove the floating cakes from the water, rinse them gently under the faucet and put them back in.   Doing the above won't hurt the pins as long as you keep the air exchange up for an hour or two until they dry off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6821198</next>\n<prev>6821187</prev>\n<first>6820575</first>\n<last>6821514</last>\n<when>1177303028</when>\n<utime>04/23/07 07:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
