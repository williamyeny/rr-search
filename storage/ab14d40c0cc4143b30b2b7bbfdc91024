{"key":"post-5806388","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5806388</id>\n<content>It isn't advanced.  In fact, it's quite basic and doesn't belong in the advanced forum, just like 90% of the posts that improperly get put there.  Mushroom metabolytes will stop bacteria dead in a petri dish. I've affirmed this repeatedly with my experiments.  That's also why jars with a bit of wet spot bacteria always seem to have a buildup of metabolytes to go with it.  It's again why grain jars or bulk substrates/casing layers incubated at too high a temperature have more metabolytes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't new 'news'.  We can thank a gentleman by the name of Alexander Fleming for discovering the antimicrobial properties of fungal metabolytes back in 1929.  A few years later, two other gentlemen surnamed Florey and Chain, both British but working in the US, learned to produce commercial quantities of the metabolyte and all three earned the Nobel prize, not because their 'myc piss' could kill bacteria in a petri dish, but because it could ALSO cure microbial infections in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, fungal metabolytes are harvested from liquid cultures of fungi in tanks of 30,000 gallons and above.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metabolytes from our mushroom crops are protecting the crop from infection, thus they serve as 'medicine'.  Whether or not that medicine is useful for humans or not is subject to further study, but my statement obviously concerned its natural duty with the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures below have been previously posted.  They are mushroom metabolytes in the very first stages of being actively secreted from the mycelium.  Even an untrained eye will easily notice that these are microscope pictures.  The total distance across the largest of these is only a few dozen microns.  Considering the color of the halogen bulb on my microscope, it would be awfully hard to see the amber color of such a small area of liquid, thus they 'look' clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a ton of research going on right now in the field and I suggest anyone interested to look into subscribing to the &lt;i&gt;International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Solomon Wasser.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380084-Metabolite_5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380084-thumb_Metabolite_5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380079-Metabolite_4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380079-thumb_Metabolite_4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380063-Metabolite_1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380063-thumb_Metabolite_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380069-Metabolite_2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380069-thumb_Metabolite_2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5966995</next>\n<prev>5805607</prev>\n<first>5720404</first>\n<last>5978056</last>\n<when>1151681861</when>\n<utime>06/30/06 06:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
