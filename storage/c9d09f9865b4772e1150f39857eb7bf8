They will look as though green or blue powder was sprinkled in that area.  If the cake itself is blue or blue-green on top, with no distinct layer, it's bruising.  Also, if you touch mold spores with a q tip, they rub right off onto the q tip. If it's bruising, the q tip stays clean.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7778076</next>\n<prev>7777949</prev>\n<first>7777949</first>\n<last>7778076</last>\n<when>1198100929</when>\n<utime>12/19/07 11:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
