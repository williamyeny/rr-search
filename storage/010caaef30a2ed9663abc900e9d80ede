The mycelium doesn't come together and create a hybrid, it grows along side one another and you will end up with some TC and some GT. So sorry mustard tiger it was all in your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if two strains crossed, which they often do, it wouldn't be a hybrid.&amp;nbsp; If a lady named Smith and a man named Jones had a baby, would you call it a hybrid?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Taken farther, if a man from Japan and a woman from Africa had a baby, would it be a hybrid?&amp;nbsp; No, it would still be the same species, human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no sub-strains.&amp;nbsp; A strain is a strain, period.&amp;nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, not the name some idiot wrote on a print, the spores of which can create tens of thousands of individual strains.&amp;nbsp; When people get a print and call it a 'strain' I go batshit, because it only serves to spread disinformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why edibles are only sold as strains when an isolated single sector of mycelium is traded.&amp;nbsp; If you fruit a shiitake for example and take a sporeprint, your original strain is gone once you start growing from spores again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15077234</next>\n<prev>15076225</prev>\n<first>15075469</first>\n<last>15079516</last>\n<when>1316011522</when>\n<utime>09/14/11 05:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
