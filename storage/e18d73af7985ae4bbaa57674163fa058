Let them sit for 30 min, then set the analog to what the digital hyg says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&amp;nbsp; Use the towel method if you're growing mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; If you're keeping cigars in a humidor, use the salt method.&amp;nbsp; No hygrometer is accurate beyond about 1/3 of it's scale.&amp;nbsp; You must calibrate in the area you're going to be operating.&amp;nbsp; Digital hygrometers are crap.&amp;nbsp; I can't say it enough.&amp;nbsp; If you have $300 to spend, you can get one that isn't too bad until you spray it with mist or you don't harvest until after spores have plugged the transducer, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; it's crap just like the cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10139675</next>\n<prev>10139645</prev>\n<first>10138533</first>\n<last>10139677</last>\n<when>1239337249</when>\n<utime>04/10/09 07:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
