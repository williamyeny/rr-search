You can get good tyvek at your local home megacenter in the paint department in the form of tyvek coveralls.  You can make a couple hundred filters out of a suit that costs five bucks.  Save the post office stuff for mailing.<br />You just want your grains double the original dry size, and dry on the outside when you load the jars.  However you do that is fine.  I soak for 4 to 30 hours, then boil for five minutes at a rapid boil, then drain.  The boiling makes the excess moisture steam off the grains as they drain.  It helps to shake the strainer around to toss the grains a bit and make more moisture steam off.<br />The old method described in stamets book is to put the water and grain in the jar and PC, but that method results in a lot of cracked kernels because they expand too fast.  Cracked kernels release starches that inhibit colonization and can lead to other problems such as bacterial blooms.<br />RR"}}
