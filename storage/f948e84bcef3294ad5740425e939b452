Ive seen it addressed that a casing with a casing layer that is without its own nutrients, is no more effective at producing mushrooms than a cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're misusing terms due to reading posts from other noobs who also misuse terms, thus everyone gets screwed up.&amp;nbsp; 'Casing' is not a name for a project.&amp;nbsp; It has two meanings.&amp;nbsp; The verb form refers to the &lt;i&gt;act of placing&lt;/i&gt; a casing layer over a substrate, and the noun form refers to the &lt;i&gt;non-nutritious layer&lt;/i&gt; that is placed over the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole conversation is moot because &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt;, which most new members are learning to grow with, requires no casing to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want air space in your terrarium for the dissipation of gasses.&amp;nbsp; In addition, this space is needed for the fruits to grow.&amp;nbsp; Many growers have stacked cakes and also placed them on BBQ skewers with mixed results.&amp;nbsp; If you're interested in maximum yield, break the cakes up and spawn them to a bulk substrate such as manure or coir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it and learn sterile procedure, switch to grains such as rye to spawn to manure or straw, coir, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13253684</next>\n<prev>13253594</prev>\n<first>13253499</first>\n<last>13254150</last>\n<when>1285612811</when>\n<utime>09/27/10 09:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
