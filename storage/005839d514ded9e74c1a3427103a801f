Mycelium is only one cell in thickness and can't be seen.&amp;nbsp; You only see it when it gets very thick.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12286384</next>\n<prev>12285108</prev>\n<first>12285108</first>\n<last>12289673</last>\n<when>1269748799</when>\n<utime>03/28/10 06:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
