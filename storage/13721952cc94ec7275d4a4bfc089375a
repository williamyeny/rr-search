Letting it run for 15 minutes will saturate the floor as you found out.  I'm sure a fan like you described will completely exchange the air in one minute, so you'd have less RH swing if you let it come on three or four times a day for only one minute.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5399330</next>\n<prev>5398670</prev>\n<first>5398670</first>\n<last>5400074</last>\n<when>1142365985</when>\n<utime>03/14/06 09:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
