The pictures above were taken with a zoom microscope of mycelium on a petri dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antibiotic properties of mushroom metabolytes have been known for many decades.   In fact, popular medicinal antibiotics such as penicillin are made from the metabolytes of fungi just as you see being secreted in the picture above.  They are clear when secreted by the mycelium, but if in contact with grains or brf/compost, etc., they get colored by whatever they're in contact with, thus the incorrect 'name' of piss, which drives me up the wall.  I have some more detailed pictures, including some of metabolytes being secreted by mycelium right after leaving the spores if anyone is interested.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5978056</next>\n<prev>5966995</prev>\n<first>5720404</first>\n<last>5978056</last>\n<when>1155999698</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 06:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
