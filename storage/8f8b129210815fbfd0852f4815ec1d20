Getting ready to set up a casing tomorrow. I remember doing a 50/50 casing of soil and verm a couple months back. To sterilize the soil (fresh from my backyard) I used some tek where u put it in the microwave for so long and wait a bit to cool off and its sterile. It worked like a charm, but now I cant find the tek anywhere.&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:frown:&quot; title=&quot;:frown:&quot;/&gt; If anyone knows about it please redirect me, or if u have ur own little casing sterilizing tek lemme know! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;  Its been so long, do u sterilize the verm for a casing? I cant remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verm is mineral so there's no harm from sterilizing it.&amp;nbsp; An oven works fine.&amp;nbsp; Bake it on a cookie sheet at 350 for half an hour or so.&amp;nbsp; The only purpose is to kill off any mold spores that may have landed on it since the manufacturing process, which uses extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's little to be gained from breaking up and casing BRF cakes, which are 2/3 vermiculite already.&amp;nbsp; Simply fruit them as cakes, or break them up and spawn to a bulk substrate such as manure.&amp;nbsp; Use water to pasteurize or steam to sterilize, not a microwave.&amp;nbsp; Don't sterilize casing or bulk substrate materials.&amp;nbsp; We only sterilize spawn such as brf cakes or grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13226316</next>\n<prev>13226298</prev>\n<first>13223032</first>\n<last>13226405</last>\n<when>1285085642</when>\n<utime>09/21/10 07:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
