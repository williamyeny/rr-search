Cubensis, like many species sets primordia for the first two to three flushes at the time pins for the first flush are set, then they become dormant until their time comes.   If the heads are black, they're aborts.  If not, they'll grow during the succeeding flushes.  If you take them off, yields will suffer horribly.<br />RR"}}
