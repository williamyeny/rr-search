Most of us use simple rubbermaid totes for gloveboxes, so breathing near the lid could get bacteria inside, so watch for that and either tape the seal or use a surgical mask.  The air in the room doesn't need to be sterile by any means.  As long as the glovebox has still air and you've sprayed inside with water, you'll be fine.  Don't use flammable stuff in your glovebox.  You can mist it with your regular mister with plain water, and whatever contaminants land on the floor or back and side walls, will stick there due to adhesion.<br />RR"}}
