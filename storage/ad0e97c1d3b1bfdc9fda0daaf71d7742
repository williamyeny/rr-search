I typically see pins within six to ten days after applying the casing layer, when kept at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital hygrometers (in my opinion of course) are not worth the plastic they're made from. Get an analog hygrometer at a cigar shop and you can calibrate it.  To calibrate, wrap your hygrometer up in a damp bath towel for half an hour.  Unwrap and simply adjust the screw on the back until the dial reads 98%.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5586925</next>\n<prev>5585053</prev>\n<first>5580550</first>\n<last>5587004</last>\n<when>1146679477</when>\n<utime>05/03/06 09:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
