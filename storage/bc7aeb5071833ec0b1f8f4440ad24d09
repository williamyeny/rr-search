If you need to fluff it up a bit, add vermiculite.  Toss in some coffee grinds from after brewing coffee.  The filter can go in as well. If using store bought manure from lowes, be sure to smell it first.  If there's any hint of ammonia, let it sit on a tarp in the outdoors for a few days before pasteurizing to flash off the ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6543431</next>\n<prev>6542401</prev>\n<first>6541169</first>\n<last>6543694</last>\n<when>1170919967</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 09:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
