Rez effect is a poor name for using verm as a bulk substrate.&amp;nbsp; It was originally thought by the person who coined that term that verm was only a water reservoir.&amp;nbsp; I also used to think this until my own experiments proved otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16393849</next>\n<prev>16393439</prev>\n<first>16392641</first>\n<last>25154824</last>\n<when>1339933113</when>\n<utime>06/17/12 02:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
