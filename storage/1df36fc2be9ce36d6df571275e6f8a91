We got rid of the thread rating system.  Anyone could give a thread ratings, and the system got abused to the point that the ratings were useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to isolate strains, or isolate away from contamination, you need the flat plane of a petri dish, and lots of them.  It takes several transfers to get away from contamination or towards single sector isolated strains, and using jars would be messy and take up a LOT of room.  You also want the mycelium growing on top of the medium, not all the way through it as you get with a thin layer of brf.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6854799</prev>\n<first>6854799</first>\n<last>6855021</last>\n<when>1177982334</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 04:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
