With mj, one can plant seeds that will generally produce a crop similar to the parents.  Such is not the case with mushrooms.  Each mushroom produces millions, if not billions of spores.  Each spore has a set of genetics unlike any other spore. 'Think fingerprints'.  Now, another analogy.   Humans breed fairly true because a male and female produce offspring, thus the child is a 50-50 cross.  Following that analogy, understand that mushrooms can have 20,000 or more 'sexes' represented in those billion or so individually unique spores.  Thus, the chances of a collection of mushroom spores breeding true to the parents is very low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea...the STRAIN THREAD is stickied at the top of the page.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6594868</next>\n<prev>6594823</prev>\n<first>6593412</first>\n<last>6594868</last>\n<when>1172107037</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 03:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
