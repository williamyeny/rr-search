{"key":"post-6108367","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6108367</id>\n<content>I wouldn't suggest that design. I use my glovebox when doing isolations away from contamination so that the flowhood doesn't blow contaminants all over the place.  If the flowhood was one side of the glovebox and turned off, contaminants would stick to the flowhood filter, then be blown off next time the flowhood was turned on.   Build a flowhood for flowhood work, then take a clear rubbermaid tote and cut two arm holes in it-Instant glovebox for $12.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6109080</next>\n<prev>6107272</prev>\n<first>6105755</first>\n<last>6109080</last>\n<when>1159401809</when>\n<utime>09/28/06 03:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
