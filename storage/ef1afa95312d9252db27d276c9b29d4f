{"key":"post-8954090","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8954090</id>\n<content>Thanks. I requested the tags be developed because the moderator staff was getting sick and tired of having to jump into multiple threads every day to correct flat out wrong and bad info being passed out to new growers, who then fail by following that bad advice.&amp;nbsp; Our hats go off to Ythan for coding the tags and making this possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, people need to quit pm'ing us to ask for the tag, which is totally inappropriate. The moderator staff is reading threads and the advice given.&amp;nbsp; We'll award the tags based on knowledge and experience &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;over time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, not degree of vacuum pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new tag has also been created in the hunting forum of 'trusted identifier' to help out there as well.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully, we've made the right choices.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8954254</next>\n<prev>8952859</prev>\n<first>8952859</first>\n<last>18991188</last>\n<when>1221840321</when>\n<utime>09/19/08 07:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
