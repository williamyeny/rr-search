You flame, and then inject.  Boiling a pint for an hour in no way, shape or form sterilized them.  In fact, I doubt seriously the center of the jars even reached 212F/100C during that time.  I steam 1/2 pints for at least 90 minutes, but usually 2 hours.  Pints will need nearly double that amount of time.<br />It's very likely that the syringe needle pushed contaminants from the top of the jar down into the substrate, and that's why it only contaminanted on the ones you injected.  You'll want to follow the pf tek to the letter the first few times until you learn the ropes.  Go pick up some 1/2 pint wide mouth jars at the grocery store and make a fresh batch.  You can see a pf tek video on yahoo or YouTube by clicking the search term 'pf tek mushroom cultivation'.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
