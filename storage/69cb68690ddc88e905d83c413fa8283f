I just looked for that picture, but it seems to have gotten lost or deleted somehow. Next time, use an inoculating loop or piece of small gauge wire.&amp;nbsp; The rounded edge of the wire won't damage the spores the way a spoon, knife or scalpel will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ziplock bags are sterile when you open them, so no need for alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10428654</next>\n<prev>10428602</prev>\n<first>10423587</first>\n<last>10428654</last>\n<when>1243777035</when>\n<utime>05/31/09 04:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
