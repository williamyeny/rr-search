Casing layers are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Casing&lt;/i&gt; is a verb, meaning it's the ACT of applying a casing layer, not a noun that refers to a tray used for growing mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no such word as 'casings', since verbs don't have a plural form.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9066480</next>\n<prev>9066173</prev>\n<first>9066029</first>\n<last>9066480</last>\n<when>1223829025</when>\n<utime>10/12/08 07:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
