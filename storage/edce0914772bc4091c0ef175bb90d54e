It has lots of pieces of white and brown paper mixed in, just like sheetrock.  I think it's the broken pieces from the manufacturing process that they chop up and put into bags. It works great.  Remove the paper, but don't get too anal about a few scraps you might miss.  The mycelium will colonize them easily.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7719928</next>\n<prev>7719543</prev>\n<first>7717402</first>\n<last>7719928</last>\n<when>1196884393</when>\n<utime>12/05/07 09:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
