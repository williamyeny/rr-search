If you don't like it, fill out a support ticket and let the administrators handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusarium is a contaminant of grains, plants and soil.  The only way it would ever contaminate a mushroom crop is if someone failed to sterilze their grains first.  Under normal conditions of growth, fusarium will not be seen in mushroom cultivation.  I closed the first thread to stop discussion of weapons on a mushroom website.  That isn't our purpose.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn't be expected to write a book on the specific fungi you posted that the Russians weaponized.  In 35 years of mushroom cultivation, I've never seen it.  If you restart this thread, I'll issue a ban.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6403918</prev>\n<first>6403912</first>\n<last>6407670</last>\n<when>1167414070</when>\n<utime>12/29/06 07:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
