The pf tek section of the video is available on YouTube or Yahoo here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=mushroom+cultivation&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://video.search.yahoo.com/se&lt;wbr&gt;arch/video?p=mushroom+cultivation&lt;wbr&gt;&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei&lt;wbr&gt;=UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; They're out of order, so be sure to watch them in sequence.  Feel free to pm the links to anybody who you think needs it.
