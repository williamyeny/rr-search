The dry tissue can also be grown out on agar without spores, but it takes a lot of transfers and patience.  I'd suggest antibiotic agar.  You can use up to 15mg of Gentmycin sulphate per liter of agar to help control bacteria.  You'll just have to isolate away from the molds though.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7077447</prev>\n<first>7077447</first>\n<last>7077477</last>\n<when>1182483505</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 06:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
