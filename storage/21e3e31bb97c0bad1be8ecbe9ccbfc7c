You can't apply wild mushroom logic to cultivated mushroom logic unless you also want to grow with no sterilization, etc.  Full colonization is one of the major pinning triggers for cultivated mushrooms.   It's also a major pinning trigger for wild mushrooms as well.  Full colonization occurs when the mycelium runs up against a natural barrier such as the edge of the log, OR another mushroom or mold species which has consolidated it's niche.<br />RR"}}
