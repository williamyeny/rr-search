If it's too thick, sand, soil, rocks, perlite, coir, verm, etc, can all be used to cut it.  You don't need to pasteurize or anything.  Just mix your colonized cakes into the manure and cover it with cardboard to keep the sun off.  Straw is better, so keep looking for it, but cardboard will give shade while it colonizes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6995966</prev>\n<first>6995966</first>\n<last>6996004</last>\n<when>1180731598</when>\n<utime>06/01/07 11:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
