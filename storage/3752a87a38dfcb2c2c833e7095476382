I don't know where this 'too high humidty' crap originally started, but it's incorrect and mushrooms thrive in 99% humidity.  Drain off any standing water and add well drained perlite until it's three to five inches deep, and provide plenty of fresh air.  It sounds like you need to make a run to the store to get more perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6914433</next>\n<prev>6913228</prev>\n<first>6911648</first>\n<last>6914904</last>\n<when>1179156803</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 06:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
