Mushrooms don't want or need a blue mood light.  It will be interesting to see how jackals EL wire works out.  The color temperature seems in the right range(if not a bit too high even), but I'm not yet convinced the intensity is there.  A $6 fluorescent fixture with a cool white or natural daylight tube inserted is a proved lighting method that will deliver excellent pinsets.  Bright, high frequency light, with as little a heat signature as you can get it preferred.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6790274</next>\n<prev>6790238</prev>\n<first>6790217</first>\n<last>9665277</last>\n<when>1176660599</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 09:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
