Verm is added to fluff it up and as a moisture reserve, but its not necessary. It will still fruit just fine.</blockquote><br />Fluffing up with verm is a secondary benefit.&nbsp; Vermiculite provides valuable minerals and will support much larger and more robust fruits.&nbsp; It's not much use as a moisture reservoir with coir because coir holds more moisture than verm.&nbsp; It is however, very valuable and should not be skipped.&nbsp; Fruiting is far more prolific when verm is added.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>calicyco said:</strong><br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><b><i>thatoneguy211 said:</i></b><br />which do you guys use, fine grade or medium grade verm?</blockquote><br />Use medium if those are your two options. You don't want a fine verm mud, bigger chunks will fluff it better. Either will work though.</blockquote><br />Fine verm is superior.&nbsp; Of the four grades of vermiculite commonly available, skip the large and the very fine.&nbsp; Fine and medium are OK, but fine is better for our use, from brf tek to bulk substrates and casing layers.<br />RR"}}
