If you got the masonry lime for mixing with mortar, it will cause the problem you're seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using horticultural hydrated lime, a good ballpark figure is to use one teaspoon per cup of peat.  Don't count the verm when adding lime.  Also, make sure you mix the lime and gypsum together first, and then mix those into the DRY peat before adding moisture.  If the peat is wet, the lime will disolve and clump, meaning it won't mix well.  You'll have zones of very high pH and zones of low pH.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7232914</next>\n<prev>7232911</prev>\n<first>7232875</first>\n<last>7233255</last>\n<when>1185624928</when>\n<utime>07/28/07 03:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
