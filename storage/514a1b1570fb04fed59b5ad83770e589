If you keep your house closed up, they'll help scrub the air.  If you keep windows and doors open 24/7 like I do, they won't do any good.  Be sure to shut them off before doing sterile work.  They move a lot of air, so cause drafts.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7441445</next>\n<prev>7441018</prev>\n<first>7440835</first>\n<last>7442412</last>\n<when>1190505515</when>\n<utime>09/23/07 02:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
