Can you move the box under a tree where it gets some sun, but also some shade?  That will heat up the interior of the box and also the substrate, which will speed things along.  Some of the books say to keep an even, steady temperature, but I've found that to be bad advice.  They do very will with a normal day/night cycling of temperature.<br />RR"}}
