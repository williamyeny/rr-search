See I just threw a shirt over 1 of my FC's cause I was lazy lastnight + fell asleep early so light was entering the bottom sides, woke up to fruits growing downwards lol.</blockquote><br />Actually, they don't triple in size.&nbsp; They may expand by that much, but they'll be skinny and not weigh much more.<br />Mushrooms are phototropic in that they'll orient toward light.&nbsp; That's so they can absorb what I'll call <i>'energy'</i> out of lack of a better term.&nbsp; Give proper light during growth, and you'll have fat, meaty, heavy fruits.&nbsp; Grow in less than enough light and you'll have thin and light fruits.<br />Those PE on the disk cover were on an upper shelf while a different type of grow was happening with MH lamps below.&nbsp; They turned away from my weenie headed 6500K fluorescent and began growing towards the MH. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif\" alt=\":laugh:\" title=\":laugh:\"/><br />RR"}}
