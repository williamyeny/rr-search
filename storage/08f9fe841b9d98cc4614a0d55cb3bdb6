A larger plenum will help to ensure laminar flow. That means your flowhood will be at least 18&quot; thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a squirrel cage blower.&amp;nbsp; What that 1.4&quot; of static pressure means is that when they pressurized it(the plenum) to that amount, the flow in cfm was what was stated in the specs, which you didn't post.&amp;nbsp; You can easily operate it at a lower static pressure, but the flow will be lower than stated in the specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24&quot; X 24&quot; is four square feet.&amp;nbsp; In a perfect world with no friction and 100% efficiency, a 400 cubic feet per minute fan(cfm @ 1&quot; static pressure) would deliver 100 linear feet per minute in air speed leaving the face of the filter, which is what you want.&amp;nbsp; Since we don't live in a perfect world, and no fan is 100% efficient, I'd suggest a blower in the 500-600 cfm range. Make sure it's rated at that cfm @ .8 to 1.4&quot; of static pressure.&amp;nbsp; Most grainger.com motors are rated at .8&quot; static pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a deal on one that's slightly larger and the flow is too much, you can always block off part of the intake, or even stack two pre-filters together to cut down on the flow.&amp;nbsp; Another option with AC motors is to get a motor speed controller, which can be found online for under $50.&amp;nbsp; However, if you get a motor rated 500 to 600 cfm@.8 static pressure, I can't imagine it flowing too high.&amp;nbsp; It would probably just develop more static pressure, since your filter is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anno has some good info about flowhoods on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fungifun.org/English/Flowhood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt; that you might want to check out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8904353</next>\n<prev>8903328</prev>\n<first>8902831</first>\n<last>26602060</last>\n<when>1221010375</when>\n<utime>09/10/08 04:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
