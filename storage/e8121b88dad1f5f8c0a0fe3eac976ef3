Every multispore inoculation will be different, thus we say, &quot;A cube is a cube&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7174337</next>\n<prev>7174229</prev>\n<first>7171642</first>\n<last>7174337</last>\n<when>1184428851</when>\n<utime>07/14/07 07:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
