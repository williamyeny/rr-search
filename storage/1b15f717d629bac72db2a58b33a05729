In nature mushroom mycelium is <br />in the ground (in the dark) until it's ready to fruit. </blockquote><br />This is incorrect.&nbsp; Mycelium crawls to the surface beneath the duff, or in the case of <i>P cubensis</i> it's in a cow pie <u>on</u> the surface.&nbsp; It's not at all in the dark. Mycelium benefits from small amounts of light during colonization on the same day/night cycle they'll be fruiting in.&nbsp;  It doesn't mean you'll fail if you don't, it means optimum performance can be increased if you do.<br />RR"}}
