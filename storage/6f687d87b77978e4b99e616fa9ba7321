No liquid enters the straw unless you remove your finger.   That's what happens when you stick a needle into alcohol.  The alcohol sanitizes the outside of the needle, but does nothing for the inside.  That's why we flame sterilize.  Heating the needle red hot cleans both inside and outside, eliminating contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6392489</prev>\n<first>6392489</first>\n<last>6393565</last>\n<when>1166722485</when>\n<utime>12/21/06 07:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
