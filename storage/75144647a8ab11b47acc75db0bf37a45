{"key":"post-5190208","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5190208</id>\n<content>There is no way to sterilize rye in a microwave, regardless of holes or no holes, plastic or other type of lid.  It takes temperatures in excess of 100C to sterilize grains, and by definition, you can not achieve a temperature higher than 100C if water is present, without pressure.  The only way a microwave or conventional oven could get rye hotter than 100C would be to evaporate all of the water out first. If you want to play, you'll need a pressure cooker or autoclave.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5190157</prev>\n<first>5149165</first>\n<last>5190208</last>\n<when>1137506029</when>\n<utime>01/17/06 03:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
