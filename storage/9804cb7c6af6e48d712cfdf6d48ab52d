The little paper coated thing from a loaf of bread won't work.   Go to the hardware store and get bailing wire, or better yet, get what I use. It's stainless steel aircraft safety wire.  It costs ten bucks for three hundred feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to leave the bag unsealed until after the PC cycle to prevent blowouts as the PC cools and the contents of the bag are still hot. This causes the bags to try to blow up like a balloon. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6043253</prev>\n<first>6040606</first>\n<last>6043627</last>\n<when>1157812846</when>\n<utime>09/09/06 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
