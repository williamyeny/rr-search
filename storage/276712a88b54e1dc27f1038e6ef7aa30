When in doubt, consider advice by members with the tag over those without.&nbsp; Don't consider members without the tag to be idiots, but when there is directly conflicting info and one of the members has a TC tag, consider it more valid.<br />An alternative is to use the 'search posts' feature at the top of every page, and then enter the username of the cultivator you want to get results from.&nbsp; The search engine will then return relevant results from that person only.<br />I agree there's a lot of crap to wade through.&nbsp; Don't consider 'old' posts to be more accurate than new posts either.&nbsp; Up until a couple of years ago, we constantly had members posting that if a cake has a spot of green mold, the mushrooms from it are toxic, which is total BS.<br />RR"}}
