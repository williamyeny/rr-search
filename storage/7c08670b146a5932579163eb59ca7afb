Cheap tools are usually not a bargain.  Anyway, I do up at least 100 filter patch bags per month and don't even own an impulse sealer.  I seal the bags with tie wire.  This allows me to open them in front of the flow hood at full colonization, then seal them back up again to fruit in the bag.  If you heatseal it, you have to cut the bag open.<br />RR"}}
