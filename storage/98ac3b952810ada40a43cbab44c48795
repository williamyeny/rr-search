The fruiting chamber sitting on the ground with a light in the ceiling works. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colored tops are fine. You just need some sort of light source that your mushrooms can grow toward. Cutting a light into the chamber is over kill in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad information.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bright, high frequency light will give more pins, and larger, meatier mushrooms with considerably more weight at harvest, and the light needs to be close to the substrate, not on the ceiling with the mushrooms on the floor.&amp;nbsp; This has been known for many years.&amp;nbsp; It has nothing to with 'mushrooms growing towards the light', as if they're lost and need to find the way home.&amp;nbsp; They grow towards light because they're deriving energy from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can grow in total darkness and still get a few tiny fruits, and even those will grow straight up.&amp;nbsp; They know which way to grow because it's opposite gravity.&amp;nbsp; If you want a wall to wall flush of big meaty fruits, use proper lighting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13161749</next>\n<prev>13161591</prev>\n<first>13160964</first>\n<last>13162002</last>\n<when>1283910391</when>\n<utime>09/08/10 04:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
