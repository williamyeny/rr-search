I say as an added precaution put some peroxide/water solution on your cotton swab and just rub the center of it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gawd, I hate it when people repeat bad info that was discredited years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruising will rub off on a q-tip and mold spores often do not.&amp;nbsp; That 'test' is bogus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got caught up in that a few years ago when someone first posted it.&amp;nbsp; I thought it made sense and even repeated it a time or two until I tried it and found it's bunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold is EASY to tell from bruising.&amp;nbsp; Bruising on mycelium looks just like a bruise on your body.&amp;nbsp; It's the color of the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Mold spores look like a 'scab' on your body, standing above the surface.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10710092</next>\n<prev>10709776</prev>\n<first>10708948</first>\n<last>10727995</last>\n<when>1248121801</when>\n<utime>07/20/09 11:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
