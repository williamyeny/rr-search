I like to lift a stack of ten dishes when inoculating or pouring, and that's nearly impossible with glass.  If you buy your plastic dishes in bulk, the disposable ones are less than ten cents each.  You can't buy the alcohol or soap to wash them for that, imo.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5024859</prev>\n<first>5024104</first>\n<last>5024880</last>\n<when>1133917117</when>\n<utime>12/07/05 02:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
