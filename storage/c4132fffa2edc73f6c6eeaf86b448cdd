There's only urban myths and they keep getting spread and added to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PE is the exception because of its shape.&amp;nbsp; It's not necessarily more or less potent than any other.&amp;nbsp; I've had plenty of bunk PE too, but they still had the same shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough strain threads.&amp;nbsp; Please use the existing one(s).
