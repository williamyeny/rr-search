The fact is, cubensis will 'pin' with no light at times, if the substrate is fully colonized and the survival instinct says, &quot;make spores before you die&quot;.   There is absolutely NO reason to keep your colonizing jars in the dark.  During spawn and casing run, a few brief looks won't hurt too much, bur remember that looking drops the CO2 level, and &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; a major pinning trigger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll move this over to basic cultivation.  It's off topic in advanced mycology.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8152843</next>\n<prev>8150410</prev>\n<first>8150410</first>\n<last>8165685</last>\n<when>1205681934</when>\n<utime>03/16/08 06:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
