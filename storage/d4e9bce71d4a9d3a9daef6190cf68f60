Is that not specifically for when one has a setup in a clear container, in order to prevent light from hitting the sides? Im thinking yes since your addressing side pinning... As far as that I have a non transparent tub and i am not having any trouble with side pins other than what you have addressed as the microclimate between cake and side. I had not thought of that, thanks for pointing that out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light hitting the sides does not cause side pinning.&amp;nbsp; As said, it's the microclimate.&amp;nbsp; HOWEVER, you should be using a clear tub.&amp;nbsp; This way you have five sides admitting light rather than one side(top).&amp;nbsp; This results in MUCH more light, which is necessary for proper pinset and flushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, fresh air is the number one pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; You don't get fresh air through polyfill.&amp;nbsp; Many strains are CO2 tolerant, but others are not.&amp;nbsp; If you have a CO2 intolerant strain, you'll get piss poor results without proper fresh air supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;jflow008 said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there any reason that i should not clone a larger healthy mushroom vs a medium healthy one? The only reason i can think of is that one fruit is an eighth and that would look funny if one is going to divide them. Not that my foaf plans that. I know some people think caps are more potent than stems but im pretty sure thats BS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large fruits are less potent per gram than small fruits.&amp;nbsp; Clusters provide the most product in small mushrooms per square foot of growing space.&amp;nbsp; If you're going to clone, the last thing you want is to clone a large mushroom.&amp;nbsp; Clone a young, rapidly growing mushroom from a cluster.&amp;nbsp; This gives you the most product at the highest quality.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12747276</next>\n<prev>12724401</prev>\n<first>12697649</first>\n<last>12747276</last>\n<when>1276268013</when>\n<utime>06/11/10 05:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
