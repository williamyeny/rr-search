Just hook green to ground, white to white, and black to black.  Be sure to make your connections mechanically and electrically tight.  A loose connection will heat up and cause it to short out.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5976161</prev>\n<first>5976108</first>\n<last>5976199</last>\n<when>1155936472</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 12:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
