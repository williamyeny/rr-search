This is murrica! </blockquote><br />Very true.&nbsp; Walmart is flat-out un-American, and the largest purchaser of made in china crap in the world.&nbsp; Every time someone shops there, they kill an American job.&nbsp; My last time in one of their stores was 1982, before at least half of the members here were born.<br />Of course, if you ever need to feel good about yourself, just go park in their lot for an hour and watch the caliber of people going in and out of the place.&nbsp; You'll be too scared of cooties to enter after that.<br />RR"}}
