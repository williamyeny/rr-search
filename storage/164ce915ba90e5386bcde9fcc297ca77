Fortunately, a few of you wild ones went out on a limb and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you starting your coir bulk grows, how about photo-documenting every step of the way?  Try new things and new additives because that's how we learn.  Never be afraid of failure because we learn as much from our screw-ups as we do from our success stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir works OK by itself, but as with any bulk substrate, adding in other ingredients makes it far better.  Coffee grinds, cow manure, horse manure, chicken manure, worm castings, seaweed, hemp fibers and straw can all be added.  Who knows what else mushrooms will devour?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we already know coir has a low Ph, so be sure to use lime, especially if you're adding coffee grinds. For a starting point, treat it as having the same Ph as peat and start out with one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of expanded coir. We also know gypsum adds calcium and sulfur which both aid in mycelial metabolism and gypsum also helps to stabilize the substrate, avoiding swings in Ph as the mycelium consolidates its hold on the coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6264943</next>\n<prev>6264735</prev>\n<first>6263954</first>\n<last>6567867</last>\n<when>1163091407</when>\n<utime>11/09/06 06:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
