At that point, add the flour.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the 2,1,1 recipe is a guideline, but if your verm is course it won't hold as much water, so you may need to use more verm or less water.&amp;nbsp; When you load the jars, the mix should look and feel dry, and absolutely NO WATER should drip out of a handful when you squeeze it as hard as you can.&amp;nbsp; Cakes made on the dry side perform better, colonize faster, and contaminate less often.&amp;nbsp; Remember, you're going to dunk and roll anyway before the flush, so that's when the water to support mushrooms gets added.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10050058</next>\n<prev>10049650</prev>\n<first>10040436</first>\n<last>10084241</last>\n<when>1238129905</when>\n<utime>03/27/09 07:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
