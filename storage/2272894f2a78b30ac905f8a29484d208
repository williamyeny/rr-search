Perlite wil have ZERO effect if there's standing water.  Always drain the perlite fully before dumping into the FC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Dry perlite will have ZERO effect on your humidity, except perhaps to lower it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, condensation on the walls has nothing to do with humidity.  Condensation indicates a temperature differential between inside and outside the terrarium.  Your windows get condensation in your house on the inside where it's dry and warm.  Your can of beer or glass of iced tea gets condensation on the outside where it's exposed to warm air.  The same principle exists in your terrarium.   Drained perlite will deliver 99% humidity in a terrarium and if there's no difference in temperature with outside the terrarium, there will be no condensation on the walls.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5515999</next>\n<prev>5515247</prev>\n<first>5512834</first>\n<last>12509169</last>\n<when>1145040110</when>\n<utime>04/14/06 09:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
