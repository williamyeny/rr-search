Cobweb spreads by breaking off tiny strands of mycelium and sending them in the air currents.  That's why it spreads/comes back so fast. You can see this under a microscope in a petri dish.  The dactylium mycelium wags like a dog's tail, then shoots strands across the dish.  It's really cool to watch. Be sure to spray down the entire surface of your casing layer even if the cobweb is only on a small part of it.  Use the 3% peroxide from the drug or grocery store right from the bottle.  It may take a few applications before you get it whipped.<br />RR"}}
