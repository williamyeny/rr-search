It's true you get fruits sooner by fruiting uncased, and the humidity can be maintained with a sheet of wax paper over the top of the substrate tray.  However, the casing layer supplies moisture to the substrate when you mist, which an uncased substrate can't easily absorb.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can inject water with a syringe, and also can pour a small amount around the edges when they start to pull away from the sides a bit.  Be very careful though when doing this that you don't saturate/waterlog your substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6251954</next>\n<prev>6251213</prev>\n<first>6251043</first>\n<last>6267508</last>\n<when>1162788185</when>\n<utime>11/06/06 06:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
