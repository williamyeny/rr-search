However, live bacteria will grow very well on brf, as many careless growers have discovered.&nbsp; It has the same <i>greasy</i> appearance and <i>garbage smell</i> as when found on grains.<br />The one thing we do know is that sterilizing brf cakes at 100C for an hour renders them able to grow mushroom mycelium, provided sterile procedures are followed.&nbsp; <br />Whether there are no endospores, or the ones that are present are simply easier to kill than grain endospores, remains to be discovered.&nbsp; Rice grows under completely different conditions than rye or wheat, so it's likely the endospores formed on grain crops in a hot, dry climate are better able to survive than endospores formed on a crop grown in wetter conditions, such as rice.<br />RR"}}
