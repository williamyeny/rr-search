(1-2 mm)  Put the lid on first, then the filter disk, then the metal ring.  This method keeps your filter disk on the outside where it will stay dry.  The two small holes will allow for plenty of gas exchange, while preventing the rye from drying out.  I'd also recommend using weak coffee to hydrate the grain, and adding a small pinch of hydrated lime per jar.  A pinch of gypsum per jar is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5086623</next>\n<prev>5086234</prev>\n<first>5081973</first>\n<last>5086623</last>\n<when>1135120315</when>\n<utime>12/21/05 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
