The important thing is to have the grains at twice their original dry size, with no burst kernels and no excess moisture in the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 24 hour soak, the grains are fully hydrated, but personally, I boil for a few minutes after the soak for one reason-It allows the grains to steam off the excess moisture from the surface as the rest of the water drains in the collander.  By shaking the collander, the grains release the excess moisture as steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experienced growers are all successful and most have evolved their own tek for preparing the grains.  As long as your grains seem dry on the outside, and are twice the original size without burst kernels, they are ready for the pressure cooker, regardless of how one goes about reaching that point.  Some growers even dry the grains off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say to any new grower to read the way the experienced cultivators do things and try a few ways.  After you pressure cook your product, don't hesitate to toss it out without inoculating if things don't look right, and start over.  Try, then try again until you get it right.  Once you find a method that works for you, stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6259469</next>\n<prev>6259357</prev>\n<first>6257384</first>\n<last>6259469</last>\n<when>1162958542</when>\n<utime>11/08/06 06:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
