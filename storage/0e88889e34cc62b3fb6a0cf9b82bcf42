{"key":"post-6099122","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6099122</id>\n<content>In cultivation we make a distinction between air exchange and gas exchange.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gas exchange&lt;/i&gt; is when the gasses must percolate up through a verm barrier or other filter to three or four small holes in the lid. The small filter on spawn bags allows for gas exchange. The very limited exchange that takes place allows the excess CO2 to get out of the jars and be replaced by very small amounts of filtered room air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Air exchange&lt;/i&gt; is when we remove the lid on a fruiting chamber or run a fan in a greenhouse to forcefully fan the contents in order to blow out the stale air and replace it with large amounts of unfiltered room air.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6099132</next>\n<prev>6098966</prev>\n<first>6091078</first>\n<last>6105886</last>\n<when>1159222470</when>\n<utime>09/26/06 01:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
