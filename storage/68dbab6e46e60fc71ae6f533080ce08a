In other words, for 1/2 cup of rye grass seed, use 1/4 cup of coffee/water.  For a quart mason jar, use 1 1/4 cup of rye grass seed and 5/8 cup water.  I still stand by my statement that rye berries will give more sclerotia faster, but suit yourself.  The rye grass seed teks are outdated and obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8089362</next>\n<prev>8089114</prev>\n<first>8083509</first>\n<last>8093602</last>\n<when>1204393426</when>\n<utime>03/01/08 07:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
