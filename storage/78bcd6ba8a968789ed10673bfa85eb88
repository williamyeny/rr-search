{"key":"post-5774569","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5774569</id>\n<content>My greenhouse floor stays totally dry.  Where is the excess water coming from?  Perhaps you're running the humidifiers too long?  I find the air in a greenhouse can only absorb so much moisture in a given time.  If you can reduce the 'on' time of your cool mist to one minute or less, very little water should ever drip.  Then, just cycle as needed to maintain humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5775252</next>\n<prev>5774551</prev>\n<first>5773191</first>\n<last>5776958</last>\n<when>1150865479</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 07:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
