Take off the foil, and I wouldn't have them in an incubator unless you fan it out a lot.  Don't let them sit in stale air.  They'll colonize in two to three weeks on a bookshelf at normal room temperature anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8470800</prev>\n<first>8470387</first>\n<last>8470819</last>\n<when>1212344193</when>\n<utime>06/01/08 09:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
