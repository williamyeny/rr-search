{"key":"post-6219430","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6219430</id>\n<content>Bang the jars against a fully inflated car or bicycle tire to break up the grains into individual kernels so they can be simply poured out of the jar without touching them. Then, put a bit of coir in a tray, then pour a bit of grain, then a bit of coir, etc., until the tray is full.  I don't like to mix with hands or tools because sometimes it damages the kernels.  Broken kernels leave openings for contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6219141</prev>\n<first>6218919</first>\n<last>6219430</last>\n<when>1162007508</when>\n<utime>10/28/06 06:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
