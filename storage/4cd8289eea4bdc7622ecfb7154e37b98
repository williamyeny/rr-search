Be sure to inject and draw water from far below the vermiculite barrier, since that's where the contamination is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you've removed it from the jar, the cake is no longer sterile, so you wouldn't want to use it to inoculate grains.  It can inoculate any bulk substrate however.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7700079</next>\n<prev>7700043</prev>\n<first>7699727</first>\n<last>7700111</last>\n<when>1196469019</when>\n<utime>12/01/07 02:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
