{"key":"post-5830940","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5830940</id>\n<content>You're going to need some sort of filter on your jars to allow gas exchange without contaminants entering. The mycelium produces CO2 just as you do when you exhale.  The gas exchange is required to get rid of some of that so they don't suffocate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't incubate at over 80F or you'll stimulate contaminant molds and bacteria over mushroom mycelium.  A few nickel sized growths is normal for five days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no negative effects of looking at your jars in the light.  Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  The total darkness thing is outdated and incorrect. I doubt seriously they'll finish without contamination if all you have is foil over the jars.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5830970</next>\n<prev>5830931</prev>\n<first>5830347</first>\n<last>5880573</last>\n<when>1152287555</when>\n<utime>07/07/06 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
