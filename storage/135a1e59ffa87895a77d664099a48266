So I plan to do that and then add it to the coir with the boiling water when i get ready to mix up my bulk substrate. Since I work at starbucks I have plenty of access to coffee grounds hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barista by day, Mycologist by night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not a proper method of pasteurization and will lead to a high contaminant rate.&amp;nbsp; Mix all your ingredients, add water to bring to field capacity, and then place in jars or bags and slowly heat to 140F in a pot of water.&amp;nbsp; Keep the center of your substrate at that temp for 60 to 90 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Don't allow the temp of the material to exceed 160F during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can cut gypsum back to 5% without a loss in performance.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13069187</next>\n<prev>13069125</prev>\n<first>13068284</first>\n<last>13072774</last>\n<when>1282160515</when>\n<utime>08/18/10 10:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
