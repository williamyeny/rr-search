It was taking fully colonized coir about to be on its 3 rd flush here soon finishong up second here soon, and putting chunks into new coir. Then putting that into colonize. No need to i have 10 quarts of wbs colonizing as we speak. Again just a question i thought would be good to know.</blockquote><br />This will not succeed.<br />One reason is that by the time it's flushed, the substrate is covered in contaminant spores, some of which have already germinated and begun to grow.&nbsp; If you spawn this to freshly pasteurized substrate, the molds will outgrow the mushroom mycelium.<br />The other reason is that the mycelium is old and tired.&nbsp; After a few flushes, they don't stop producing due to running out of nutrients, but rather because the mycelium has produced fruits and reached the end of it's natural life cycle.&nbsp; Giving this old mycelium a fresh substrate would be like giving an old man a steak dinner.&nbsp; It's not going to make him young and virile again.<br />RR"}}
