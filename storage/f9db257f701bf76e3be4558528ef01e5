Air exchange is the key.  Keep a supply of fresh air in your growing chamber and trich will be a rare headache.  I've also found during the summer months when the trich spore load is very high, you can put a bit of hydrated lime in a salt shaker and lightly shake it on the surface of your casing material.  This provides a very high ph zone right were the airborne spores land, preventing germination.  <br />RR"}}
