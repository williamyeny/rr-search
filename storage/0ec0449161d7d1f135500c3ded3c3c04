{"key":"post-5942584","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5942584</id>\n<content>Both ideas are sound.  I colonize substrates such as compost, manure, and wood chips/sawdust in filter patch bags all the time.  In fact I have over 50 bags colonizing right now of at least ten different species.  In my location during the summertime, it's about the only way to beat the horrible ambient contaminant spore load count.  I often pasteurize compost/manure in quart jars, then transfer to filter patch bags to colonize, and inoculate each with a quart of grain spawn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5942465</prev>\n<first>5941131</first>\n<last>5942584</last>\n<when>1155013520</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 08:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
