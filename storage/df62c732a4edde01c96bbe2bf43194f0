Since 20 volume peroxide is 6%, you'll want to dilute it 50/50 with water, and then spray it on cobweb mold.  There isn't much more use for peroxide than that.  Good air exchange will prevent cobweb in the first place, making peroxide unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7478503</next>\n<prev>7477342</prev>\n<first>7477091</first>\n<last>7478503</last>\n<when>1191360258</when>\n<utime>10/03/07 12:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
