It's not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuzz on the base is generally caused by insufficient fresh air exchange, but some strains just do that regardless.&amp;nbsp; It's not a problem unless other symptoms of insufficient fresh air appear such as long stems or excessive mold outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17085467</next>\n<prev>16800861</prev>\n<first>16799535</first>\n<last>17085467</last>\n<when>1346987969</when>\n<utime>09/07/12 06:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
