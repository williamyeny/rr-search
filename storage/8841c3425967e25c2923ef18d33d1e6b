You could even put them in the fridge or dunk them in cold water for a few hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FromRussiaWiLuv said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea, that's a good idea. I honestly never liked the shotgun terrarium. I'm not saying it doesn't work, but I've always lived in too dry of a place or it to be effective for me. I would tape up MOSTof the holes, if you have ac in there then you have plenty of circulation. Maybe one row of holes is all you would really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FromRussiaWiLuv said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're fine bud. Tape up those holes and keep fanning and misting. As long as there's circulation in the room then you're fine. A fan on low in a large room provides plenty of FAE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FromRussiaWiLuv said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh gotcha on the sig. And regardless, I can guarantee its accurate information. It's simply putting two and two together. If he can't get a terrarium with a fogger/mister above 80% , then my best guess is the climate in which he's trying to do it in is too arid.... Correct? Taping most of the holes up will fix the problem after a cold dunk. I don't see how that's innacurate information. I've tried a shotgun terrarium at least 6 or 7 seperate times at a few different locations years ago. I've had to tape and untape holes more times then I would ever care to. Plus, that fan from the AC will do a good job drying it out as well if you have a bunch of holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FromRussiaWiLuv said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they feel really heavy, it may just be the outside drying out, you could probably skip the dunk. I would mist often until they start to look refreshed again. If you still see no signs within a week with 24 hr light, misting and fanning regularly, then something is very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FromRussiaWiLuv said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you have plenty of condensation building up on the inside of the chamber, you should be good. If there's no water droplets clinging to the walls of the terrarium then your humidity is too low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're handing out very bad advice in every single post above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will NEVER be condensation on the sides of a shotgun terrarium, nor should there be condensation on the sides of any functioning terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cakes that are heavy are too wet, not too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 hours of light is bad for mycelium which operates on a 24 hour circadian rhythm which requires a day/night routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should never be holes taped up on a shotgun terrarium, as this lowers both fresh air and humidity.&amp;nbsp; Shotgun terrariums will work well in very dry locations.&amp;nbsp; Where I live it's usually around 5% to 10% humidity outside the shotgun terrarium, and 95% inside.&amp;nbsp; Besides, fresh air is the number one pinning trigger, so don't sacrifice it for excessive humidity.&amp;nbsp; A fog is never good as it's the same as rain and will saturate substrates, ruining performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold shocking is used on fall fruiting cold weather mushrooms. &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; is a tropical species which doesn't benefit from cold shocking, and in fact is set back and damaged by it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18524008</next>\n<prev>18523151</prev>\n<first>18519272</first>\n<last>18528659</last>\n<when>1373192268</when>\n<utime>07/07/13 01:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
