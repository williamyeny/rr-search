I just tossed out nearly a dozen spawn bags this morning.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a tip a lot of people don't know.  NEVER do sterile work when you're sick.  I had the flu and inoculated some bags in front of the flowhood, wearing two surgical masks stacked together and latex gloves, thinking that would be enough protection.  Wrong.  Viruses can easily penetrate right through a laminar flow HEPA filter.  Surgical masks can stop bacteria, but not viruses.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6546248</next>\n<prev>6342368</prev>\n<first>6342322</first>\n<last>6546299</last>\n<when>1165465311</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 06:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
