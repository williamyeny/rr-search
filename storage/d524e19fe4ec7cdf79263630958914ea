Make up more dishes and begin transferring the best looking mycelium in very small pieces to new plates.  Isolate for rhizomorphs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures below are from a strain isolation cycle.  The first picture is from a small swipe of spores on each section of the plate, and the first batch of transfers away from the original colony ten days later.  The second picture is from two or three days after the first, and shows the very first signs of rhizomorphic mycelium.  They should be transferred as soon as noticed.  &lt;i&gt;Don't allow petri dishes to grow fully out.&lt;/i&gt;  The third picture is after the second transfer and shows a fully isolated rhyzomorphic strain in the six o'clock position on the dish.  The other two sections on the last dish still need another transfer.  From starting the spores on agar until the last picture which is ready to inoculate grains, was just under three weeks.  Speed is critical, so make transfers fast and get your final product ready as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-20/787402919-Strain_Isolation_02a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-20/787402919-thumb_Strain_Isolation_02a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-20/787511125-Strain_Isolation-First_transfera.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-20/787511125-thumb_Strain_Isolation-First_transfera.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-20/787402939-Strain_isolation-third_transfer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-20/787402939-thumb_Strain_isolation-third_transfer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5645199</next>\n<prev>5640844</prev>\n<first>5640844</first>\n<last>5652585</last>\n<when>1147875250</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 05:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
