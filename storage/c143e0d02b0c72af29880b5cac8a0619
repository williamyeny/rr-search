They do very well on horse manure cased with peat/verm indoors.  Keep the casing layer to 1/4\" maximum thickness.  They also prefer to fruit in the 80F range, so keep your room a bit warmer when fruiting.  Pan cyans/copelandia generally take 14 days or so to begin pinning after exposing to fruiting conditions, so be sure to have your casing layer properly limed so it can go the extra time without growing a nice crop of green. You also want to let the casing layer colonize most of the way before removing the foil and putting in the FC.<br />RR"}}
