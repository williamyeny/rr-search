The name someone wrote on the syringe or print is irrelevant. We've heard every so-called 'strain' in the book is super potent, and we've heard every so-called 'strain' in the book is bunk for potency. <br />We've heard reports on every tek in the book being excellent for potency and we've heard reports on every tek in the book having bunk potency.<br />It's just because new growers don't understand genetics and think good or bad potency is due to something they did or neglected to do.<br />Light is necessary for the mushrooms to reach full size and weight.<br />RR"}}
