Bear in mind, farms buy this stuff by the hundreds of tons, and they load it into side-dumping semi trailers from an overhead hopper. The stuff is water soluble. Don't waste time or equipment grinding it back to its powder form.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14077644</next>\n<prev>14077615</prev>\n<first>14077585</first>\n<last>14078200</last>\n<when>1299467570</when>\n<utime>03/07/11 05:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
