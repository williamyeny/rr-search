It's not recommended, but people have left cakes submerged in the refrigerator for weeks without killing the mycelium. In fact, I have liquid mycelium cultures stored in the refrigerator for years that are still viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, 24 to 36 hours is the recommended time for dunking cakes, and bulk substrates are usually fully hydrated after 4 to 6 hours.  The biggest reason for not going longer than that is bacteria will grow from the substrate in the anaerobic conditions under water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6872535</next>\n<prev>6871597</prev>\n<first>6871460</first>\n<last>6872535</last>\n<when>1178298631</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 08:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
