The cube strain that was renamed should be boycotted until it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copes are a logical second grow after one masters cubes.  Copes are not as fast as cubes, and generally take twice or more as long to begin pinning after exposing to fruiting conditions.  For this reason alone, if you're not experienced at casing teks, yours may fall to contamination due to the extra time involved.  It's also a temptation to 'do something' like scratching when pins don't form as fast as you think they should, therefore ruining the project.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5337262</next>\n<prev>5337189</prev>\n<first>5336726</first>\n<last>5337766</last>\n<when>1140876778</when>\n<utime>02/25/06 04:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
