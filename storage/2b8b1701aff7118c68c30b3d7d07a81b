Be sure to wash your hands and arms first, then put on a freshly laundered long sleeve shirt to cover the skin on your arms.(dead skin cells flake off all the time and they'll have bacteria)  Remember, a glovebox does not have to be totally airtight or sterile.  It only serves as a place for you to open or inoculate jars or petri dishes in a draft free environment.  I haven't used attached gloves in years because they're such a pain in the butt to work in.  Latex gloves give you really good control.  Of course, do your glovebox work in a very clean room with no fans or air conditioners etc running.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5678183</next>\n<prev>5677994</prev>\n<first>5677972</first>\n<last>5678557</last>\n<when>1148694142</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
