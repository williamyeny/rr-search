I don't recommend trying to force mycelium back into veg mode once it starts fruiting.  Sometimes it works, but at the risk of contaminants getting a foothold during the time the mycelium is weakened.  However, if you've already crumbled it up, go for it.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6637046</prev>\n<first>6636083</first>\n<last>6637053</last>\n<when>1173113041</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 06:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
