There's two different zones of growth, indicating that one of them at least is the wrong stuff.  In addition, the solid line around the uncolonized portions tells me they're contaminated.  If the mycelium was trying to colonize those sections, it wouldn't have a distinct edge like that.  The mycelium would 'fade' into the uncolonized areas.  Keep any jars like that away from the others or toss them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6574868</next>\n<prev>6574039</prev>\n<first>6566191</first>\n<last>6574868</last>\n<when>1171645880</when>\n<utime>02/16/07 07:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
