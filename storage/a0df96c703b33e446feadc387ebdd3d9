{"key":"post-7794872","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7794872</id>\n<content>There's lots of ways to hydrate a cake.  Dunk and roll is my favorite method.  You're actually hydrating the individual mycelium cells, so it's a good idea to push the cakes a few inches under water so there's a bit of water pressure on them.  Remove after 24 to 36 hours and roll in dry verm, which is then heavily misted after being placed into the FC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another method is to pile up verm as deep as you can on top of the cake and keep that saturated.  Another is to set the cake in a saucer of water.  The straw method also works.  These last methods are fine during a flush.  Between flushes or prior to the first, I'd still suggest a dunk and roll.  Mushroom farmers have been soaking substrates in water to rehydrate them for at least a thousand years.  It's the time-proven method.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7794875</next>\n<prev>7794606</prev>\n<first>7793607</first>\n<last>7794887</last>\n<when>1198507199</when>\n<utime>12/24/07 04:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
