{"key":"post-5633871","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5633871</id>\n<content>60% coir is the same as no casing layer at all.  It will fully colonize.  It's ok though as cubes will fruit without a casing layer, but not quite as well.  I would recommend 50/50 peat/verm for your next project.  Peat is also a fraction of the cost of coir, so you'll get a better product at a reduced price.  When/if you switch to peat, be sure to only case the top.  We don't case the bottom of a bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5633891</next>\n<prev>5633840</prev>\n<first>5632714</first>\n<last>5634990</last>\n<when>1147735217</when>\n<utime>05/16/06 02:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
