{"key":"post-6214554","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6214554</id>\n<content>Glad you were successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to avoid confusion on nomenclature, you can't call an uncased project a 'casing'.  The casing is a top layer that helps to supply moisture and a microclimate conducive to fruiting.  What you did was fruit an &lt;i&gt;uncased substrate&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 50/50 is a &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;casing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; recipe, not substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply the casing over the top of the substrate, which is the layer that supplies the food to the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise I'm not nitpicking, but new folks get confused with the misapplication of terminology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you apply the casing layer, it's best to cover the tray with foil to allow the casing to colonize for a few days.  When mycelium is poking up through 20 to 30 percent of the casing layer, place the tray into fruiting conditions.  You can lightly patch the spots the mycelium has reached the surface to even out your pinset, but it's optional.  It does result in a more even pinset that makes for better eye candy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To soak a cased substrate,(I prefer the term &lt;i&gt;soak&lt;/i&gt; over dunk) the easiest way is to put it in the sink with the faucet running gently and allow it to fill up the tray and overflow for a few hours, then drain and place back into fruiting conditions.  It helps to put a couple of rocks or full jars of water on top of the substrate to hold it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on a successful grow!</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6214572</next>\n<prev>6214528</prev>\n<first>6214528</first>\n<last>6216859</last>\n<when>1161897704</when>\n<utime>10/27/06 12:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
