A fully colonized casing will be a very poor performer because it defeats the purpose of having a casing in the first place.  Introduce to pinning conditions as soon as the mycelium shows through the surface.  Some growers patch that first spot or two, then when the rest begins to poke through, introduce to fruiting conditions, but patching is optional.  Never wait for full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5964564</next>\n<prev>5963863</prev>\n<first>5963496</first>\n<last>5964564</last>\n<when>1155612313</when>\n<utime>08/15/06 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
