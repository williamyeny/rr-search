Once it hits the edges of the jar, it can't expand any more, so it stops taking on water.  When you rinse the cake after the dunk, give it a good smell.  If it smells like fresh mushrooms, you're good to go.  It looks ok, but the smell test is more sure.  If it smell like dirt, it's mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a believer in the verm roll after dunking.  The verm sticks to the cake and serves as a moisture reservoir after you mist, slowly releasing the moisture to the cake.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7013711</next>\n<prev>7013583</prev>\n<first>7013330</first>\n<last>7014390</last>\n<when>1181099906</when>\n<utime>06/06/07 06:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
