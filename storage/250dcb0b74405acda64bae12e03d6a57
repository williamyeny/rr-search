If they were tempered they would be brittle, And a brittle pressure cooker would make no sense, Seeing at there are thousands of pounds pushing outwards. A tempered PC wouldn't expand at all it would just burst... I don't know about you, but I was a welder for 6 years, and I know about the structure of steel..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever tried to cut a piece of tempered glass? It shatters into a thousand pieces. Just as your PC would IF it WAS tempered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt; Yes, I have a special diamond cutter for tempered glass.&amp;nbsp; It works great and does not shatter the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your six years welding experience notwithstanding, his PC tempered NOW, and not in a good way, since the bottom got much hotter than the sides and top. If your understanding of the 'structure of steel' means you think pressure vessels are made from mild steel, a bit of study is in order, because &lt;b&gt;pressure vessel steel is tempered&lt;/b&gt;. I fail to understand how in the age of the internet people have become so lazy that they'll talk trash without so much as taking 20 seconds to do a simple search. This is the second time this afternoon I've had to rip a head off for spewing bullshit without having an understanding of the basic facts. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ASTM_International_standards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;The ATSM has produced many standards&lt;/a&gt;, including for pressure vessel steel, and requirements for welding the same, for which I'm a certified welder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any pressure vessel which has been ran dry is toast, period. End of story.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who uses one after overheating is a candidate for the Darwin Award. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, one shouldn't assume it's steel.&amp;nbsp; Many pressure cookers are forged aluminum, including the top of the line All American.&amp;nbsp; The factory won't even repair units which have been ran dry.&amp;nbsp; They're disposed of, just as are pressure vessels which have been shock cooled, both of which destroy the integrity of the metal.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15431930</next>\n<prev>15431798</prev>\n<first>15431153</first>\n<last>15440870</last>\n<when>1322440569</when>\n<utime>11/28/11 02:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
