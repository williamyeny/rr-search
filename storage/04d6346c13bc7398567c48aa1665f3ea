As for the process, you have it correct.  Remove the vermiculite, and fill the jar all the way to the top, then put the lid back on.  Refrigerate during the soak to control bacteria in the aneorbic environment under water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6225706</next>\n<prev>6225064</prev>\n<first>6225042</first>\n<last>6226362</last>\n<when>1162180446</when>\n<utime>10/30/06 05:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
