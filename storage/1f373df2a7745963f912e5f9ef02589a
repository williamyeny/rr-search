You need a hygromter.  Humidity is invisible microscopic particles of moisture that are suspended in the air and can't be seen.<br />Drill holes in your tub, even if it means going to the hardware store and buying a drill.  Drill holes in all six sides and use three to five inches of well drained perlite for humidity.<br />Indirect sunlight from the sides is fine.  If you notice them all growing towards the window, simply rotate the terrarium every day.<br />RR"}}
