I even run a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;commercial mushroom farm&lt;/a&gt; in this dry climate using adapted shotgun terrarium technology with passive air exchange and no humidifiers. Simply mist a few times daily as you're supposed to do and it will work fine.&amp;nbsp; We have lots of members in desert climate zones.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17967511</next>\n<prev>17967505</prev>\n<first>17967478</first>\n<last>17967511</last>\n<when>1363523877</when>\n<utime>03/17/13 03:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
