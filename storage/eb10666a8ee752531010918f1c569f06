It won't look like, taste like, or even BE a cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for mixing the dry ingredients together first, is because dry ingredients WILL mix together.   Wet ingredients will clump and bond to each other, and not mix properly.  It ain't dogma, it's common sense.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7834852</next>\n<prev>7834512</prev>\n<first>7832918</first>\n<last>7834852</last>\n<when>1199548692</when>\n<utime>01/05/08 05:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
