It's enough for about 500 petri dishes so it goes a long way.  I've mixed it myself, and I've bought it premixed.  I prefer the latter, but that's because I have too many other projects going, so it helps to let somebody else do part of the work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to the oriental food store, ask for 'auger auger' because that's how they say it.  If you pronounce it aager, they will just look at you funny.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6609875</next>\n<prev>6609836</prev>\n<first>6609009</first>\n<last>6611293</last>\n<when>1172454863</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
