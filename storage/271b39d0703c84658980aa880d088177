It's going to be an engineering problem to regulate heat from top to bottom.  Without a fan that can circulate vertically, you'll see up to a 10F differential between lower and top shelves.  A substrate temperature over 84F actually slows down growth.  Thus, any ambient temp over 81 for jars or 78 for trays of manure, and you're slowing down mycelium growth while promoting bacteria and thermophilic fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7298294</next>\n<prev>7298222</prev>\n<first>7297515</first>\n<last>7313583</last>\n<when>1187219318</when>\n<utime>08/16/07 02:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
