As Agar said it's all marketing hype and quite frankly, annoying.  It's also irrelevant, since all cubes are the same species.  The reason we made the STRAIN THREAD that's a sticky at the top of the page is to keep these discussions that only distract new growers from cluttering up the forum.  Good luck and welcome to the shroomery.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6804330</prev>\n<first>6803580</first>\n<last>6804354</last>\n<when>1176922787</when>\n<utime>04/18/07 09:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
