In fact it's been around 10F the last few mornings.&amp;nbsp; Just set your terrarium somewhere near the stove where it will maintain 75F or so.&amp;nbsp; Don't heat the terrarium itself or your precious humidity will turn into condensation on the walls, and your crops will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since wood heat tends to dry out the air in your house, get a couple of humidifiers and run them 24/7.&amp;nbsp; I keep two coolmists running, one on each side of my wood stove.&amp;nbsp; They make it nice and cozy inside and there's no static when I walk across the carpet and touch something metal.&amp;nbsp; A rule of thumb is if you get shocked from touching stuff, the air in your house is too dry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9072022</next>\n<prev>9069802</prev>\n<first>9067189</first>\n<last>9072058</last>\n<when>1223912061</when>\n<utime>10/13/08 06:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
