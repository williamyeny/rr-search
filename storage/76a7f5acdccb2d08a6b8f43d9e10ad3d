They require stale, still air.  That makes green molds fairly easy to control.  All the sterile procedure in the world won't help once your project is in fruiting conditions.  At that point, give fresh air and keep it moving.  Green molds will still pop up from time to time, but they won't be devastating.<br />RR"}}
