Inject whenever your intuition tells you the substrate is thirsty.  Over time, you can develop a pretty good feel for picking up a tray and 'reading' the moisture content by the weight.   The advantage is a quicker flush and there's no casing layer to contaminate.  The disadvantage is in somewhat smaller pinset, which wax paper might help to fix.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5502632</next>\n<prev>5501192</prev>\n<first>5500197</first>\n<last>13139081</last>\n<when>1144763547</when>\n<utime>04/11/06 04:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
