Two rows of jar rings will get the bottom of the jar out of the water.  If you don't have that, use a row of empty jars on the trivet, so the jars with substrate are elevated out of the water.  1/2 pint jars are not tall enough to avoid the splashing as the water boils if they're down in it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6616038</next>\n<prev>6615910</prev>\n<first>6615866</first>\n<last>6616038</last>\n<when>1172591339</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 05:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
