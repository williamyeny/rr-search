If you have them on a shelf in the open air, there is no need to turn them upside down.  Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium so there is no need for darkness.  Don't put them in direct sunlight though.  Normal room temperature is fine too.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7406375</next>\n<prev>7404709</prev>\n<first>7404459</first>\n<last>18686285</last>\n<when>1189721941</when>\n<utime>09/14/07 01:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
