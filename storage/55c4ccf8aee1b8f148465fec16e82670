Foil serves to keep condensate from dripping off the lid and getting into your jars.  Coffee filters are useless for mycology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapid cooling your jars is asking for the internal moisture content to get screwed up, as well as risking cracking the jars themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't necessary to leave the jars in the PC until they're room temperature, although that's best.  You should however, leave them until they're cool enough to remove without heat protection for your hands.  It never pays to be in a hurry in this hobby.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6110374</next>\n<prev>6110339</prev>\n<first>6106653</first>\n<last>6110839</last>\n<when>1159450497</when>\n<utime>09/28/06 04:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
