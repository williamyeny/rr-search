Transfer tiny pieces of each to new dishes.  As the original dish grows out and more sectors emerge, transfer each of these to new dishes.  Do the same with the ones that have already been transferred once because they'll sector into several growths.  Repeat the process until you have all isolated strains with no divergent sectors.  This requires a LOT of petri dishes, but is well worth it and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, use half of each dish to inoculate a quart or two of rye, then case and fruit out each strain so you can find the one or two super strains that suit your needs.  Put the other half of each dish into the refrigerator, making sure each one is carefully marked to match it to the quarts of rye that are being fruited.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6297934</next>\n<prev>6297385</prev>\n<first>6297328</first>\n<last>6297958</last>\n<when>1163901954</when>\n<utime>11/19/06 04:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
