You get more product from a bulk substrate such as manure or coir, but it does squat for potency, which is genetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bird seed shoud be spawned to a bulk substrate as said above.  It doesn't fruit as well as rye when cased.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6563971</next>\n<prev>6561954</prev>\n<first>6560309</first>\n<last>6564068</last>\n<when>1171387729</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 07:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
