This way i would be able to increase my humidity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would lower humidity.&amp;nbsp; As said above, perlite works due to the very high surface area that evaporates moisture.&amp;nbsp; With standing water, you only have a flat surface area the size of the tub.&amp;nbsp; With perlite, you have a thousand or more times that much area, thus much higher humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, humidity isn't the most important pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is.&amp;nbsp; Shoot for the maximum amount of fresh air possible, and then mist as required to make up for humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10737122</prev>\n<first>10734703</first>\n<last>10737245</last>\n<when>1248535541</when>\n<utime>07/25/09 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
