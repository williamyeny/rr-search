I am just saying i might not be an expert, but I have th facts down. I did a SGFC, humidity wont stay high, im not sure what your climate is like but if it is not 15% humidity and 6000 feet up then my situation has circumstances, that must have attributed to the humidity levels not maintaining. I know misting and fanning does put moisture onn the myc and fanning allows FAE for the water to evaporate from the casing causing pinning, but I also know higher humidity= larger yeilds. TEKs i believe vary climate to climate.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your insight bhodi...blessings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, you just described my climate zone exactly except my humidity is closer to 5% all winter and I heat with a wood stove.&amp;nbsp; Shotgun terrariums work perfectly here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn't lose two tubs to cobweb because the humidity was too low. . .I'm sure what you thought was a humidity problem was a&lt;i&gt; made in china hygrometer&lt;/i&gt; problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquarium pumps won't supply enough fresh air.&amp;nbsp; Lack of fresh air is the cause of cobweb mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19895538</next>\n<prev>19895316</prev>\n<first>19894643</first>\n<last>19898722</last>\n<when>1398394831</when>\n<utime>04/25/14 06:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
