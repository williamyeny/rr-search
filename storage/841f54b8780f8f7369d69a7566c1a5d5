Just put it in a larger jar, then fill it all the way up with water and put the lid on so the cake is forced under the water.  Leave for 24 hours in the refrigerator.  You should be able to tell by feel from the weight of the cake if it needs moisture or not.  You'll develop that ability with a bit of experience.  Just feel what they weigh before and after dunking.  Lots of cake growers roll the cakes in dry vermiculite when they first come out of the dunk.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6003220</prev>\n<first>6001825</first>\n<last>6003241</last>\n<when>1156737387</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 06:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
