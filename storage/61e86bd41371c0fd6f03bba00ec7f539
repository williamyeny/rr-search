You'd probably get better results to leave it partly open all the time, regardless of the instructions they gave.  If it's pinning/fruiting, it needs air exchange.   Also, contaminants are encouraged by stale air, so air exchange reduces the chances of bad thing happening, not the other way around.<br />RR"}}
