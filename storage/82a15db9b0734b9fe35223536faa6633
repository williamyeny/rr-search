There is no automated system that can replace your eyeballs and mister.&amp;nbsp; I'm an electrical engineer by profession with a specialty in automation, so believe me when I say if the whole process could be automated, I'd have done it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9413811</prev>\n<first>9412430</first>\n<last>9414539</last>\n<when>1229043565</when>\n<utime>12/12/08 02:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
