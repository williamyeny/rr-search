As spores drop, the basida collapses, then another one grows in its place with four fresh spores.  Any nasties from the terrarium or handling will be gone during the first two hours.  The basidia that form after that will have formed on your printing medium and will be clean.  When printing, I cover the caps with a sheet of tyvek to allow air exchange which prevents bacteria buildup, while keeping mold spores off the print.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6407500</prev>\n<first>6407462</first>\n<last>6407613</last>\n<when>1167412823</when>\n<utime>12/29/06 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
