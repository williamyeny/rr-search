With manure or compost, I squeeze as hard as I can and expect a small stream of drips for a second or two and then it should stop.  With sawdust, I don't want any water to come out at all when I squeeze as hard as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's normal for a substrate to shrink.  It isn't from drying out.
