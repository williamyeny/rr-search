I haven't stepped foot in one in over ten years, so break the addiction.  There's nothing you need for mycology that can't be found elsewhere, usually at your neighboorhood garden center or hardware store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll find 'natural daylight' fluorescent tubes at Lowes.  They're usually in the T-8 configuration which means it's the skinny fluorescent tubes, not the fatter ones like cool white.  Be sure to get a fixture made for T-8 if those are the tubes you buy.  And yes, they really do make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6738691</next>\n<prev>6738537</prev>\n<first>6736656</first>\n<last>6744244</last>\n<when>1175548975</when>\n<utime>04/03/07 12:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
