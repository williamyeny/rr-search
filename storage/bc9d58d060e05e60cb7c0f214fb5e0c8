{"key":"post-6995985","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6995985</id>\n<content>I get iodine from a local drug store.  It says &quot;10% iodine solution&quot; on the bottle.  I like it for cloning because it kills bacteria without stressing out the mycelium the way peroxide does.  When you're cloning, you want the mycelium to grow as fast as possible, and peroxide shocks it, and then it has to recover before it grows again.  As we all know, molds grow faster than mushroom mycelium, so we don't want to do anything to slow down growth.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7003037</next>\n<prev>6995737</prev>\n<first>6995737</first>\n<last>7003318</last>\n<when>1180731236</when>\n<utime>06/01/07 11:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
