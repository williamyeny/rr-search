When the caps are fully open, they're ready to pick and won't get larger, so pick those, even though they're tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a 24 hour dunk, followed by a roll in dry verm to give you a casing layer over the entire cake for the next flush.  If it doesn't improve the product, then you have a bunk strain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6760534</next>\n<prev>6760010</prev>\n<first>6755574</first>\n<last>6760761</last>\n<when>1176041425</when>\n<utime>04/08/07 05:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
