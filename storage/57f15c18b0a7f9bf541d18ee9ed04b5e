Carefully spray the 3% peroxide full strength from the bottle between the fruits to cover all the surface of the cake.   If the cobweb is on the fruits already, take the cake to the sink and wash it under the faucet.  Wash all the mold off the cake and fruits. For some reason, gently misting pins seems to kill them, but they can stand a direct blast by the faucet, followed by a dunk, and survive just fine.  Go figure.  Once you wash them off, return to your fruiting chamber, but do whatever you have to do, to have more air exchange.  Cobweb only grows in stale, still air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5151283</prev>\n<first>5151283</first>\n<last>5153343</last>\n<when>1136727829</when>\n<utime>01/08/06 03:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
