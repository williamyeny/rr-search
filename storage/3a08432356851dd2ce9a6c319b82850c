Don't get fresh manure from the pile they make when they clean out the stalls.  To tell if a nugget is aged properly, pick it up in the field and break in half.  It should look like compressed hay, and be completely dry.  If it's still green, or slimy/wet inside, it's not ready.  There should also be no smell from the thing other than a hay/dirt scent.  If it stinks, don't take it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6132994</next>\n<prev>6132337</prev>\n<first>6132063</first>\n<last>6133144</last>\n<when>1159998856</when>\n<utime>10/05/06 12:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
