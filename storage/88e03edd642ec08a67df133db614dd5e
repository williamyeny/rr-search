You'd be better off in a tray.  Don't force the mycelium to colonize the perlite that has no food for it anyway. It will waste needless energy.  Either crumble into a tray and case, or crumble into three times as much coir or manure, but not perlite.  Perlite is for helping to humidify a terrarium, not for use as a substrate.<br />RR"}}
