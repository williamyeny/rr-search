A kitchen is the worst place I can think of to do sterile work.  There is more bacteria and fecal matter in a kitchen than your toilet.   Clean out a closet to use, or better yet, build a still air glovebox.  Flame your needle red hot, then insert it into the jar while still red hot.  The verm and substrate will cool it most of the way, and the first few drops of solution will finish cooling the needle, so the rest of your spore solution can flow contaminant free.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5741098</prev>\n<first>5740863</first>\n<last>5742480</last>\n<when>1150151260</when>\n<utime>06/13/06 01:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
