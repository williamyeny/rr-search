You don't want to puncture them, so I simply lift one edge of the lid barely up and squirt the syringe right down the side against the jar.  Always work in a glovebox or in front of flowhood and wear gloves that have been washed with alcohol after putting them on.  Be sure to flame your needle, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the metal lid goes on the bottom, and I use them upside down so the metal is against the glass rather than the rubber.  This makes it easy to get off.  Next is the filter disk, then the metal ring.  I prefer synthetic filter disks over any other filter material.  I have some that are five years old now and used hundreds of times.  I've never yet had to throw one away.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5683737</next>\n<prev>5683724</prev>\n<first>5683661</first>\n<last>5683738</last>\n<when>1148854025</when>\n<utime>05/29/06 01:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
