This has been posted so many times, I can't believe people still give the horrible advice to attempt to cut it out.  Doing so only spreads the contaminant spores.  There is NO SUCH THING AS GREEN MOLD!  The mold is white.  Only the spores are green.  You CAN'T cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide will NOT kill trichoderma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss out contaminated cakes, or bury them outside.  Don't leave them in the fruiting chamber to finish.  The FC is easy to clean.  The surfaces of all the walls/carpet/drapes/clothing in your house is impossible to clean, thus mold spores will be haunting you for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7530897</next>\n<prev>7530733</prev>\n<first>7530559</first>\n<last>7530967</last>\n<when>1192727830</when>\n<utime>10/18/07 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
