I don't recommend that with molds, but if the mycelium overtakes the bacteria, you can fruit it, but don't try to use it as spawn to bulk or the bacteria will come back to bite ya.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cubes will sometimes overcome bacteria, but oyster mushrooms are strongly antibiotic and will run over bacteria like it wasn't even there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6186987</prev>\n<first>6183769</first>\n<last>6187101</last>\n<when>1161295183</when>\n<utime>10/20/06 12:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
