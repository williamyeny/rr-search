There's a reason the jar didn't finish colonizing though, but you can work on that with your next crop.  It was probably contaminated with bacteria, so when the mycelium ran up against the natural barrier of the contamination, it was just like running up against the glass edge of the jar, thus the mycelium sensed it had fully colonized the available substrate and began fruiting, which is the reproductive cycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6637384</next>\n<prev>6636983</prev>\n<first>6636384</first>\n<last>6639601</last>\n<when>1173113557</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
