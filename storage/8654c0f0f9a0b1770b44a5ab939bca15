And as someone once said, Throwing up into a toilet that is melting infront of you probably isn't exactly the trip your looking for :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've worked for years to try to beat this kind of disinformation, but it still gets repeated for no reason whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm the one who talked about the melting toilet, but that is in relation to rotten mushrooms.  There's a big difference between a &lt;i&gt;mushroom&lt;/i&gt; that was picked and put fresh in a plastic bag to rot, and a &lt;i&gt;cake&lt;/i&gt; with mold on it that was buried outside.  Every mushroom in nature grows in the presence of molds and nobody dies from eating wild boletes, oysters, etc.  For the last time, fruits from substrates that also harbor molds DO NOT RENDER THE MUSHROOMS TOXIC!  In fact, they rarely even impact the flush. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjm/v38n2/v38n2a10.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjm/v38&lt;wbr&gt;n2/v38n2a10.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7666276</next>\n<prev>7666250</prev>\n<first>7666099</first>\n<last>7667504</last>\n<when>1195748523</when>\n<utime>11/22/07 06:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
