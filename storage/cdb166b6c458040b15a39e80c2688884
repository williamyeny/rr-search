Your question is like asking how much weight you can haul in a red truck as compared to a blue or yellow truck, and then demanding people read the question before bringing up that there's different sized trucks, springs, etc.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're not to the point of growing large amounts yet, because you haven't learned the basics.&amp;nbsp; Study, learn, study some more, and then ask questions when you can do better than asking how much does each method yield, as if ANYONE can ever answer such nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm locking this before it becomes a flame fest.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11898254</prev>\n<first>11897964</first>\n<last>11898274</last>\n<when>1264450912</when>\n<utime>01/25/10 10:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
