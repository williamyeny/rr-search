They come pre-sterilized and you can't wash and re-sterilize glass ones for the price of the plastic dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid is supposed to be loose.  It's also not tight fitting on the glass ones.  It's how you get gas exchange.  Wrap with parafilm to prevent contaminants.  Parafilm is gas permeable so allows gas exchange while filtering out larger particles such as mold spores and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6657705</next>\n<prev>6656452</prev>\n<first>6655974</first>\n<last>6658147</last>\n<when>1173575490</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
