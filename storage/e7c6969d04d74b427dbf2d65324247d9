The mycelium actually eats the substrate for food, so it gets smaller as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's too dry in your room, run a cool mist humidifier 24/7 if need be too keep the room air moist.  That will make it easier to keep your terrarium at the proper humidity level.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more air exchange the better, so keep your lid loose after misting just like you are.  As long as you have the correct humidity inside the terrarium, you're fine.  It's normal to need to mist the casing layer to keep it moist.  It's also normal and important for the casing layer to dry out somewhat between mistings.   If it stayed wet all the time, your pinsets would suffer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6201352</next>\n<prev>6200449</prev>\n<first>6200308</first>\n<last>6201352</last>\n<when>1161599850</when>\n<utime>10/23/06 01:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
