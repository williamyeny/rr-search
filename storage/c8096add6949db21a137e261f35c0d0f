That ratio is reversed with fluorescents.  In addition, those who say you only need a little light are either new, or satisfied with crappy pinsets.  Bright, high frequency light will give the best results.  good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6904634</next>\n<prev>6903713</prev>\n<first>6903713</first>\n<last>6904718</last>\n<when>1178948387</when>\n<utime>05/12/07 08:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
