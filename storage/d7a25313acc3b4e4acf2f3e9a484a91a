Hygrometers only have about a 20% range that they're accurate, so for our uses, you want it calibrated at 99%.<br />Fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger, so uncover those holes, and simply run a cool mist in your room as required.&nbsp; This will also make you feel better and your houseplants will also do much better.&nbsp; This is also important for those of you in snowy or extremely cold climates in winter when you have super low ambient humidity.<br />RR"}}
