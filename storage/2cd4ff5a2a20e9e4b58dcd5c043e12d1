However, with a sterile lab, tyvek sleeves, a laminar flow hood and many years of experience, I've had nowhere near 100% success.  I've probably thrown out a few hundred petri dishes over the last several years.  Of course, I've used it several tens of thousands of times with outdoor fruits that entered the lab heavily contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the deal:  A computer fan will not draw air through a hepa filter.  None.   Even if  piece of tyvek is used, or a synthetic filter disk, a computer fan will not develop the static pressure required to move air through the filter. It will simply cavitate and stir the air around, but not draw it through the filter. In fact, when I PC jars with tyvek filters, there's a vacuum in the jars for several hours afterwards, as the air slowly enters the jar through the fiter.  If it takes a few hours to move enough air to fill a jar, think of how many hours it would take to fill a rubbermaid tote.  I'm sure in effect, what you have is a still air glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, gloveboxes need not be sterile.  I don't use lysol, oust or anything else to clean mine but soap and water.  Still air is what makes gloveboxes work, whether or not that still air is sterile or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anytime something is moving in a glovebox, it is swirling around the contaminants within, thus increasing the risk that those contaminants will enter your sterile media.  Good luck to all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7781406</next>\n<prev>7781203</prev>\n<first>7780708</first>\n<last>7784546</last>\n<when>1198175797</when>\n<utime>12/20/07 08:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
