Bacterial endospores require a higher temperature than boiling to kill off and that's the problem with using an oven.  It's impossible for water to be at a temperature above 100c/212f without being under pressure.  Since the oven isn't under pressure, once the interior of the grains reaches 250f, all the moisture will by the laws of physics, be gone.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5092471</next>\n<prev>5091356</prev>\n<first>5091356</first>\n<last>5095703</last>\n<when>1135225756</when>\n<utime>12/22/05 06:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
