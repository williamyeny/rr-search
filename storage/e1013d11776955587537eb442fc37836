During incubation, you'll keep it covered with foil to restrict gas exchange a bit and block off light.  If it's dry, upon spreading over the substrate, spritz it down a bit if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir/verm should be 40/60, not the other way around.  You want to use more verm than coir.  Much better is 50/50 peat-verm.  It's also better to pasteurize casing material than the partial sterilization you get from the microwave.  Try not to let the material temperature exceed 170F.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5732377</next>\n<prev>5731962</prev>\n<first>5731768</first>\n<last>5732650</last>\n<when>1149908406</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 06:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
