You weren't and neither has anyone else. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mad2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:mad2:&quot; title=&quot;:mad2:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose of the electron micrograph below was to show the distinctive shape of the pleurocystidia in &lt;i&gt;Copelandia cyanescens&lt;/i&gt;, but there's a few basidia shown as well, and even in the few that are shown, one can see the individual sterigmata diverging from each basidium at different angles.&amp;nbsp; As can be seen, some spores will hit the opposite gill surface, others hit another basidium or its spores, but some are ejected up to several inches away when a mushroom is standing upright.&amp;nbsp; Anyone with a microscope can easily see that the shape of a spore resembles that of an airfoil.&amp;nbsp; However, it's an airfoil without a control surface, thus they will fly in all directions.&amp;nbsp; Stamets reports they're ejected at a force of 25,000 times the force of gravity.&amp;nbsp; He also knows very well how much force this is, since he got a first hand demonstration of the physiological effects of only 4 to 5 Gs in my aerobatic aircraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere around here I have a larger version of that same picture, with the focus zoomed out.&amp;nbsp; It's probably on one of my backup hard drives, but shows about a hundred basidia, and one can really see how the spores will go in all directions, not straight across or straight down.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-21/027681940-outdoorchulacopelandia1_w_credits_a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-21/027681940-thumb_outdoorchulacopelandia1_w_credits_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13087841</next>\n<prev>13086967</prev>\n<first>13080659</first>\n<last>20834204</last>\n<when>1282526564</when>\n<utime>08/23/10 04:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
