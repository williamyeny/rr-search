You'll hear new growers use it a lot around here, but it's incorrect and only serves to confuse other new growers. The word 'casing' is a verb, and refers to the &lt;u&gt;act&lt;/u&gt; of placing a &lt;i&gt;casing layer&lt;/i&gt;(noun) on top of colonized substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spawn your fully colonized cakes or grains to your bulk substrate material, cover with foil or some other cover to hold CO2 at high levels, but with a few small nail sized holes punched in it so 'some' of the gasses can escape.&amp;nbsp; When fully colonized, you can fruit it uncased by removing the foil cover to allow for a sudden drop in CO2 as fresh air is introduced, or you can apply a casing layer and wait for that to colonize before introducing to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; Peat/verm with gypsum and lime is a good casing layer material should you decide to use one.&amp;nbsp; Coir is a bulk substrate material similar to manure or straw.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9894239</next>\n<prev>9894069</prev>\n<first>9894049</first>\n<last>9898580</last>\n<when>1235977195</when>\n<utime>03/02/09 08:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
