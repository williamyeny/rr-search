I want to let them sit and just do stones at first and maybe that would be the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, but you'll pad your bet by doing several quarts over fewer half gallons, but either work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many sclerotia producing species only make stones at the edges of the substrate, which means up against the glass.&amp;nbsp; Using containers such as filter patch bags with more surface area can give you more product for the same amount of grains.&amp;nbsp; Good luck and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the Mckenna brothers book was out when I was starting. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14019363</next>\n<prev>14019302</prev>\n<first>14019302</first>\n<last>14019363</last>\n<when>1298570299</when>\n<utime>02/24/11 07:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
