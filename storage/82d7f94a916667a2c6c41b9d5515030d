It also has a large surface area which means you have only a fraction of the mycelium per jar that you would have with other grains.  Remember, the mycelium colonizes the surface of the grains, so larger grains means less total grains in a jar, thus less surface area to colonize.  In short, I used popcorn for well over a year before swearing it off forever.  If you can't get anything else, it will work, but consider it a spawn of last resort.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5734176</next>\n<prev>5733563</prev>\n<first>5733563</first>\n<last>5734176</last>\n<when>1149964243</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 09:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
