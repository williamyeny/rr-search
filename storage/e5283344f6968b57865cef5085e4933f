You must indicate to temperature sensitive mycelium that a change in seasons has occured.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunking in the refrigerator is good practice because it keeps bacterial blooms under control while the organic material of the cake is under water.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, it must be undestood that dunking for 24 hours in the refrigerator is NOT cold shocking.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold shocking is for edibles such as agaricus, shiitake, p nameko, shaggy manes, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropical species do not benefit from a cold shock.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6070234</next>\n<prev>6070192</prev>\n<first>6066820</first>\n<last>6074268</last>\n<when>1158508021</when>\n<utime>09/17/06 06:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
