RR said so himself here is a quote from him<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />Which is why I've long said the salt test is totally unacceptable for mushroom growing.&nbsp; 71 + 23 = 94% which is fine, provided you mist a few times daily.<br />Get rid of the heat lamp and put your shotgun terrarium in front of a bright window during the day.&nbsp; Your temps at night are fine.&nbsp; You'll get heating from the window during the day and be OK.&nbsp; Mist as required.<br />RR <br /> </blockquote> </blockquote><br />A bright window does not mean direct sunlight.&nbsp;  It means very bright outdoor light.&nbsp; A south facing window in the northern hemisphere would be considered a bright window.&nbsp;  Try to avoid direct sunlight for more than a few minutes per day.&nbsp; However, a few minutes of direct sunlight will indeed help to trigger a great pinset, as long as all other pinning triggers have been met.&nbsp; Light is a secondary pinning trigger, not a primary one.<br />RR"}}
