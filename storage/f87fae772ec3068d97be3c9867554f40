Trich mycelium is more 'spotty' then cubensis, and NEVER rhizomorphic OR cottony.  It is however, white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air exchange and a cycling humidity will help to control trichoderma but nothing will eliminate it.  I've been doing this for a long time and throw out projects every week, but bear in mind, I'm using wood based substrates these days almost exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see green on a bulk substrate or casing layer, mist it lightly to hold the spores in place, then gently slip the tray into a platic trash bag.  Seal immediately and discard.  There are methods to save a wood or sawdust based substrate from trich if you catch it fast enough, but cased substrates should get tossed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6224412</next>\n<prev>6224390</prev>\n<first>6222763</first>\n<last>6225910</last>\n<when>1162164461</when>\n<utime>10/30/06 01:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
