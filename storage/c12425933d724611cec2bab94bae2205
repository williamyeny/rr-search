Its like rule one .

If you pull of the weight you'll blow your jars up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it's ALL about moisture content.&amp;nbsp; It won't blow your jars up because they have holes in the lids for gas exchange.&amp;nbsp; The pressure inside the jars will vent through the holes, thus taking the moisture out with it(and possibly ruining the filter material).&amp;nbsp; The jars may crack from rapid cooling, but won't blow up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8855554</next>\n<prev>8855317</prev>\n<first>8854198</first>\n<last>11517096</last>\n<when>1220191673</when>\n<utime>08/31/08 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
