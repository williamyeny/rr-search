The mycelium doesn't know when you're looking at it or not. I currently have over 200 pf jars incubating on an open shelf in a room that's lit at least 18 hours per day.   Light isn't a pinning trigger until the CO2 gets dumped and replaced by fresh air.  <br />Forget that 1/2 second of light to trigger pinning.  It's incorrect.  Light is only a <i>secondary</i> pinning trigger.  Full colonization and air exchange are the biggies.<br />RR"}}
