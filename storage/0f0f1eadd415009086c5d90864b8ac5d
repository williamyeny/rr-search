A whole grain of rice has several layers. Only the outermost layer, the hull, is removed to produce what we call brown rice. This process is the least damaging to the nutritional value of the rice and avoids the unnecessary loss of nutrients that occurs with further processing. If brown rice is further milled to remove the bran and most of the germ layer, the result is a whiter rice, but also a rice that has lost many more nutrients. At this point, however, the rice is still unpolished, and it takes polishing to produce the white rice we are used to seeing. Polishing removes the aleurone layer of the grain-a layer filled with health-supportive, essential fats. Because these fats, once exposed to air by the refining process, are highly susceptible to oxidation, this layer is removed to extend the shelf life of the product. The resulting white rice is simply a refined starch that is largely bereft of its original nutrients. </blockquote><br />From <a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.p<wbr>hp?tname=foodspice&dbid=128</a><br />RR"}}
