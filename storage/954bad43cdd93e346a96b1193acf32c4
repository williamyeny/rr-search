Today I've got a stuffy nose, plugged ears, receding cough. Head doesn't feel hot, so nothing flu related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You caught a cold, unrelated to growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of mycelium isn't going to make anyone sick, nor is handling fruits or mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom spore allergy takes time to develop, but nonetheless, you didn't have any spores to breathe when birthing jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom spore allergy is caused/triggered by &lt;b&gt;breathing&lt;/b&gt; spores, not eating them.&amp;nbsp; Even with species which I'm allergic to the spores, such as &lt;i&gt;P ostreatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H ulmarium&lt;/i&gt;, I can still eat and enjoy the mushrooms, but can't be around them in the grow room when they're releasing spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15604791</next>\n<prev>15604172</prev>\n<first>15603915</first>\n<last>15605035</last>\n<when>1325525574</when>\n<utime>01/02/12 07:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
