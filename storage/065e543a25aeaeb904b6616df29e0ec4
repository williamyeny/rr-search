{"key":"post-6880451","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6880451</id>\n<content>The theory of operation I designed the system on is that cold air has a higher pressure than warm air, due to the molecules being closer together.  Since air currents always flow from high pressure to low, the air that surrounds the cool perlite is wicked up into the warmer air in the terrarium that is heated by the substrates and/or the lighting.  The holes in the bottom of the terrarium feed more air in, which then passes through the perlite, being humidified as it does.  The end result is a self circulating auto FAE system that provides both fresh air and humidity at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally worked with a similar system when I was working on the Alaska pipeline construction project in the early 1970's.  The support structures that hold the pipeline above ground as it passes over the tundra are filled with ammonia that uses the cold ground to circulate the ammonia through an expansion valve, to the warmer air above, thus making a self-contained refrigeration system that uses no electricity to keep the ground around the supports frozen solid, even in summer.  By keeping the ground frozen all year, they don't shift as much, which would rupture the pipeline.  The terrarium with holes in all six sides is simply an adaptation of that technology for our use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6880463</next>\n<prev>6880379</prev>\n<first>6613734</first>\n<last>17821829</last>\n<when>1178478029</when>\n<utime>05/06/07 10:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
