Lots of noobs badmouth bagged cow manure because they hear other noobs badmouth it.  The stuff works great if properly prepared.  I live in a large city too, but have no trouble getting horse manure, straw, organic rye berries, etc.  It can all be found.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7796094</next>\n<prev>7795240</prev>\n<first>7793893</first>\n<last>7796094</last>\n<when>1198536152</when>\n<utime>12/25/07 12:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
