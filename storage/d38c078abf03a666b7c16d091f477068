This tub has four or five inches of depth. They are Pan Cyan Hawaii from sporeworks and NOT goliath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say thin substrates of 1 1/2 inch because most people are growing in small trays or baking pans.&amp;nbsp; If you're growing in a large container such as 50 gallons or a kiddie pool, a thicker substrate still has the same depth to area ratio, which is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tried to use four to five inches of substrate in a baking dish, copes would have a hard time fruiting, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster, you should always pasteurize indoor substrate and casing mixes.&amp;nbsp; If growing outdoors, you can use it unpasteurized unless it's coir, which should always be pasteurized.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium has a hard time digesting unpasteurized coir.&amp;nbsp; The heat seems to make it more digestible.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12456080</next>\n<prev>12451917</prev>\n<first>12451448</first>\n<last>17315929</last>\n<when>1272202083</when>\n<utime>04/25/10 04:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
