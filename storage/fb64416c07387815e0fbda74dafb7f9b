{"key":"post-4471823","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4471823</id>\n<content>You can buy replacement mason jar lids at any grocery store that sells mason jars.  They'll be in a small box right next to the jars. You need to use the lids or your spawn/substrate will dry out too much.  Be sure to have the filter material on the outside of the lid so it won't get wet.  I use three 1/8&quot; holes in my lids because I don't want the grains hitting the filter material when I shake the jars.  If the filter gets wet with grain juice, it will contaminate right through it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4472518</next>\n<prev>4471756</prev>\n<first>4440773</first>\n<last>4483454</last>\n<when>1122698050</when>\n<utime>07/30/05 07:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
