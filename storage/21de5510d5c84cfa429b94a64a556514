{"key":"post-6529480","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6529480</id>\n<content>You can easily cross strains of cubensis, but such are not hybrids any more than a human from china making a baby with a human from Africa is a hybrid.  It's a 'cross' but not a hybrid.  Now, if a human could make a baby with a cow, or a cube can cross with a reishi, THAT would be a hybrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monokaryons of various strains of cubensis will easily pair up.  Workman and I have both posted pictures and procedures(we do it differently) in advanced mycology, so a search there will bring up the threads. Dikaryons can also mate with dikaryons from another strain, but the results are faster when a toxin such as snake venom is placed in the petri dish with the agar.  Look in advanced for threads from 2004-2005.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6528701</prev>\n<first>6528331</first>\n<last>6529480</last>\n<when>1170612659</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 08:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
