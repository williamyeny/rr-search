Mid 70's are great for fruiting, but they'll still fruit if it's warmer or cooler than that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6060687</next>\n<prev>6059545</prev>\n<first>6056728</first>\n<last>6060687</last>\n<when>1158218587</when>\n<utime>09/14/06 10:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
