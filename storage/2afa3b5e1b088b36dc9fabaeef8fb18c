The lens and the light are on the same side of the object you're viewing.  Stereo microscopes are for looking at gems, coins, bugs, and mycelium on a petri dish to examine for contaminants, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A zoom microscope is a stereo microscope with an adjustment to vary the magnification without changing lenses.  Maximum magnification with stereo-zoom and zoom microscopes is usually around 20X to 30X.  I have a pretty high end zoom microscope that goes to 50X, but the field of view at that magnification is pretty darn small, defeating the purpose of using a stereo microscope in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A light microscope has the light on the opposite side of the lens from the object you're viewing, thus you see the light that shines through the object.  Laboratory and medical microscopes are the light type.  If you want to examine the internal structure of spores, or view mycelium to look for the number of nuclei in each cell or to look for clamp connections, you'll want a light microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order a stereo microscope, be sure to get LED lights, even if they're more expensive.  Coin collectors and jewlers can use the cheaper halogen that seems to be standard on stereo microscopes, but the heat will cook your mycelium, and if you look at something inside a petri dish, the dish fogs up in three or four seconds from the heat, blocking your view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's some pictures taken with a light microscope on my website on the introduction to mycology page &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/1811640.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/18&lt;wbr&gt;11640.html&lt;/a&gt; along with the mushroom gill shots which were taken with a zoom microscope, and the basidia pictures at the bottom of the page were taken with a scanning electron microscope.
