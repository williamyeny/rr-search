A second leading cause of stalling is too much water.  Be sure to stick with the recipe of one part brf, one part water, and two parts vermiculite and you'll be fine.  The fine grade verm is all I can find lately too, and it works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is make sure you don't pack down the mix in the jar.  Spoon it in and level it off before adding the verm barrier, but don't pack.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6345265</prev>\n<first>6345063</first>\n<last>6345520</last>\n<when>1165543200</when>\n<utime>12/08/06 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
