Wood chips are optional, but use hardwood.  You can even buy oak, birch, etc at the lumber yard and cut it up to use.  It's expensive that way though, but it will grow mushrooms.  Boil the wood chips in a pot for an hour or so to hydrate them, or soak for a day or two.  Don't forget to supplement with oat, rice, or wheat bran.  Use gypsum.<br />RR"}}
