Nobody suggests eating the trichoderma itself.  However, mushrooms from the affected substrate are completely fine.  <br />Keeping the contaminated substrate for a few extra days is not recommended unless you move it outside in the shade.  Otherwise, the fruits should be picked now and the substrate carefully wrapped up and tossed out.<br />RR"}}
