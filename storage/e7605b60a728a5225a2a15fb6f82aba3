As a test, I recently left some sterilized supplemented sawdust in these bags for three months in open air without inoculating, and they were fine, contaminant free. However, you really should invest in a flowhood if you want to move up to bulk growing like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no need for a silicone injection port on a spawn bag.&amp;nbsp; Simply inject through the bag and then immediately cover the wound with tape.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12829276</next>\n<prev>12829166</prev>\n<first>12829150</first>\n<last>12829633</last>\n<when>1277930782</when>\n<utime>06/30/10 11:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
