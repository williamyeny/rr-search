It's near my balcony where we keep the sliding glass door open all the time. The breeze from the open door helps with the FAE too, and the natural sunlight is a plus.  They get about an hour a day of actual direct sunlight, which this time of year is fine.  My terrariums are stacked vertical with four 4&quot; PVC couplings under the bottom one, and between each additonal one.  I have three stacked on top of each other to take better use of the vertical real estate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6648053</next>\n<prev>6647747</prev>\n<first>6643895</first>\n<last>6648065</last>\n<when>1173366257</when>\n<utime>03/08/07 05:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
