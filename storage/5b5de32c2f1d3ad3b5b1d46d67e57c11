Keep it covered with foil and it should be done in a couple of days.  It's only the uncolonized substrate that will contaminate, so you're almost out of the woods.  You could case if you want to now, but waiting a bit should give better performance.  A few years ago, it was common for guys to put the casing layer on at the time the bulk substrate was spawned.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6243167</next>\n<prev>6243052</prev>\n<first>6243039</first>\n<last>6246990</last>\n<when>1162577096</when>\n<utime>11/03/06 08:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
