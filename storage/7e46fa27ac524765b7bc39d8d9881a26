Making honey/karo LC is actually not proper myclogical practice, and is not nearly as reliable as colonizing grains, transfering water to grains, and removing the myc water, using the myc water as the LC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct.&amp;nbsp; While it often works, LC should not be made from spores.&amp;nbsp; You don't know what you have until you've either invested a couple of months, or wasted a couple of months.&amp;nbsp; For every success story with beginners making liquid cultures, there's two or three failures that I deal with every day in the contamination forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth of mycelium in LC is considerably slower than mycelium growth on grains or even BRF cakes.&amp;nbsp; There is a good way of making LC, but it involves petri dish proved isolated strains, an eberbach sterile blender, and malt dextrose media with a magnetic stirrer.&amp;nbsp; With the above, you can make a several thousand-fold increase in cells within 7 days, but it's far from a beginner tek.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9055440</next>\n<prev>9055408</prev>\n<first>9055248</first>\n<last>9058218</last>\n<when>1223601903</when>\n<utime>10/10/08 04:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
