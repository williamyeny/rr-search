If nothing went into your jars, you'll be fine.  However, all it takes is a rubbermaid with two arm holes cut to make a glovebox. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we can't recommend such a procedure.  That would be like somebody recommending driving drunk just because he does it and hasn't gotten hurt yet.  Good luck on the experiment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6224109</prev>\n<first>6223414</first>\n<last>6224166</last>\n<when>1162158579</when>\n<utime>10/29/06 11:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
