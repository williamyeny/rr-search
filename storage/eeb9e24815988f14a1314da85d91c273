Stamets mentions it in his books because it's essential for certain strains of edibles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as said above, when dunking, put the cake/casing in the refrigerator to keep bacteria from forming as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a cold shocking contest over at mycotopia to put to rest the fact of fiction.  Give it a read.  Interesting stuff.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mycotopia.net/discus/messages/100158/139018.html?1091369066&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.mycotopia.net/discus/messages/100158/139018.html?1091369066&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2980568</next>\n<prev>2978765</prev>\n<first>2976476</first>\n<last>2980900</last>\n<when>1092017335</when>\n<utime>08/09/04 05:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
