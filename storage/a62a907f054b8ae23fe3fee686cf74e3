They'll still fruit at 70F of course, but they do better at 75F, thus the 5 degree temp drop will degrade performance.  If you colonize at 75F to 80F and give a 20F drop, they will perform quite poorly at 55F to 60F.  Tropical species do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; respond well to cold shocking.  This has been known and proved for many years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7593824</next>\n<prev>7593689</prev>\n<first>7593558</first>\n<last>7593885</last>\n<when>1194191896</when>\n<utime>11/04/07 05:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
