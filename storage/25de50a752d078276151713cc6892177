{"key":"post-6281887","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6281887</id>\n<content>I assume by 'poo' you mean manure?   It would help when asking questions to also distinguish between horse &lt;i&gt;manure&lt;/i&gt; and cow &lt;i&gt;manure&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears you sandwiched the manure between layers of casing material.  Is that correct?  The casing layer should only be placed on the top, never the bottom.  The side pinning could be the result of using a clear container or a foil container that reflects light deep into the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common cause of no pins on the surface can be from the casing layer too wet or too dry, or the Ph being off.  The casing layer should also not be applied until the substrate layer is fully colonized.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6281911</next>\n<prev>6281867</prev>\n<first>6281867</first>\n<last>6283556</last>\n<when>1163524471</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 07:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
