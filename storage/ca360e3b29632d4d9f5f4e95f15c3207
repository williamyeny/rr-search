That's enough for about three quarts of manure, which is what is supplied.  If you try to expand it three times, it's likely to fail before first flush.  You're lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide won't kill the green mold.  You need to toss it out when the green shows up.  A higher spawn ratio will get you colonized much quicker next time, avoiding the molds, hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7770484</next>\n<prev>7769769</prev>\n<first>6758567</first>\n<last>7770484</last>\n<when>1197935294</when>\n<utime>12/18/07 01:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
