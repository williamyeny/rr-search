It's about the only contaminant I recommend trying to save a project from.  Cobweb is in the air, everywhere.  It requires stale, still air to grow.  You'll need to up the air exchange to prevent it from forming.   Once formed, simply put 3% peroxide full strength from the bottle into your mister and douse the casing layer.  The cobweb will melt on sight.  A second application might be required the next day. Be sure to pasteurize, never sterilize casing material.  A sterilized casing layer will contaminate very easily.<br />RR"}}
