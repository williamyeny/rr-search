Pooling in the bottom or not, I hate to see water collecting on individual grains.  You should let them air dry after the simmer to evaporate the moisture off the surface.  Some growers who soak but don't simmer, use a towel.  Just make sure the exterior of the grains are dry when you load the jars.  The moisture you want will be inside the kernels provided you've soaked and/or simmered until the grains are double the original size from when they came out of the bag.<br />RR"}}
