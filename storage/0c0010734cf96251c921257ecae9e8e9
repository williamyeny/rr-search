{"key":"post-7745915","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7745915</id>\n<content>My first grow was completely free.  I had a compost pile made from grass clippings I picked up in the rich neighboorhoods on Sunday afternoons.  The gardeners cut the grass, rake it up, bag it up, and put out by the street, ready for my pickup truck to come along and get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then picked up a fruiting cow patty from a field, and mixed it around the edges of the compost pile.  Result:  Free mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7745943</next>\n<prev>7745736</prev>\n<first>7744665</first>\n<last>7746254</last>\n<when>1197417504</when>\n<utime>12/12/07 01:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
