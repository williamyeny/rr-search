You can certainly go past that point, but growth is slower, and the mycelium is less able to hold it's own.  I use master slants that are stored in the refrigerator at 35F.  When I get mycelium out, I let it grow for a few days and then put it right to grains.  The slant goes right back into the refrigerator, thus after a year, the cells in the master slant have only divided about what they would have in one week at room temperature.<br />RR"}}
