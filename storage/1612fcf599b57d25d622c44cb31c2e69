I'd try to get a space heater in that room to get the temps up to 70 to 75 if possible.  Don't heat the martha itself, heat the room it's in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've grown outdoors in lower temps than that, and they did well, but there was also a bit of sun warming on the soil for a few hours a day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's some evidence that lower temps produce a higher quality product.  Several growers have reported higher potency from keeping the FC at a lower temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6474479</next>\n<prev>6474146</prev>\n<first>6473980</first>\n<last>6474479</last>\n<when>1169173223</when>\n<utime>01/19/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
