Open it up and either let it dry out somewhat or bake some dry verm in the oven at 350 to kill any mold spores on it and mix it in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13182338</next>\n<prev>13182123</prev>\n<first>13182110</first>\n<last>13185875</last>\n<when>1284262908</when>\n<utime>09/12/10 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
