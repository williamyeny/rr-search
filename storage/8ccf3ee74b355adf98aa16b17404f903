I run my greenhouse now with the hygrometers pegged.  Air movement is the key.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last six months I've been experimenting with a stand alone air conditioner connected to the greenhouse. Supply air enters at the floor level blowing right onto the output of the coolmist, and&lt;br /&gt;across ten trays of damp perlite.  The return air duct is piped into the ceiling of the greenhouse to pull the air and mist to the top of the unit, where it's re-circulated by the AC. I run the&lt;br /&gt;compressor when I need to cold shock edibles, but run the blower 24/7.  The combination of high humidity and constant air circulation seems to be working very well.  I'll do a writeup on it when I get&lt;br /&gt;all&lt;br /&gt;the kinks worked out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6191214</next>\n<prev>6190842</prev>\n<first>6189760</first>\n<last>6191841</last>\n<when>1161372085</when>\n<utime>10/20/06 10:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
