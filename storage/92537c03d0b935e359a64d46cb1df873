Then, dunk prior to first flush to put the moisture for fruiting into them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the fine verm which holds more water per cup then the medium grade verm, but still use the basic 1-1-2 pf recipe.  This makes a drier substrate that colonizes in two weeks.  Give an extra week to consolidate, then birth, dunk and roll.  I see pins regularly 48 hours after birthing this way instead of having the cakes sit there for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6666682</next>\n<prev>6666479</prev>\n<first>6666425</first>\n<last>6667544</last>\n<when>1173842074</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 06:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
