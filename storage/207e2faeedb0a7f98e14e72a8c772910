This is often misunderstood by growers.  You want to get the moisture content of the substrate up to near maximum prior to fruiting, but then it needs to be slowly drying out during fruiting.  This stimulates the mycelium to say, &quot;Oh shit, we're drying out and better reproduce(make fruitbodies for spore dispersal) before we die&quot;.  As the casing layer dries out, you can replenish the moisture with misting, but then allow it to partially dry before misting again.  Don't let it get too dry, but don't mist hourly either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6&quot; substrate depth is probably too much for cubes.  There's a chance that it has gone anaerobic in the coir and died.  Cubensis performs very well with a 2&quot; to 4&quot; substrate depth with a 1/2&quot; casing layer on top.  It also performs quite well with no casing layer, provided you can maintain near 100% humidity in your grow area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6977538</next>\n<prev>6976848</prev>\n<first>6976740</first>\n<last>6977975</last>\n<when>1180372827</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 08:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
