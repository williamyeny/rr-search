Bottom line was the tubs that had petri dishes between 75F and 81F showed no difference in growth.  Below 75F, and above 81F growth slowed down, with a rapid drop in colonization speed below 70F and above 83F.  At 86F, a petri dish would be 2/3 colonized, while its sister at 75F would be fully colonized.  Rate of growth at 86F was exactly the same as rate of growth at 72F, with fastest growth as said, occurring between 75F and 81F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that these tests were for linear growth in the two dimensional plane of a petri dish.  In three dimensonal space such as in grain jars or bulk substrates, the effects of thermogenesis need to be considered, so ambient temps should be lowered slightly to compensate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7870713</next>\n<prev>7868876</prev>\n<first>7864335</first>\n<last>15963874</last>\n<when>1200171139</when>\n<utime>01/12/08 10:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
