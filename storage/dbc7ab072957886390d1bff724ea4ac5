{"key":"post-5674878","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5674878</id>\n<content>TMC is a classic and I still refer to it a lot.  In the last twenty years we've learned a few things though.  One, as hyphae said is the mycelium metabolytes.  Another is that colonizing mycelium need not be kept in total darkness.  I think Paul fixed that one in GGMM, but I know at his beginners and masters seminars he points that out, and his own incubation rooms filled with hundreds of species, are under 8 to 12 hours per day of fluorescent lighting while work is being done.  That has been my experience as well.  Light doesn't become a significant pinning trigger prior to full colonization and the introduction of fresh air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is probably nitpicking, but I don't like the TMC method of preparing grain jars which is add dry grain, add water and a pinch of gypsum, and PC.  We now know that if you'll take the time to rinse the grains very well before cooking, they don't stick and clump up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a couple of others I can't think of now.  Nothing major though.  It's a great reference work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5674636</prev>\n<first>5674595</first>\n<last>5674878</last>\n<when>1148616177</when>\n<utime>05/26/06 07:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
