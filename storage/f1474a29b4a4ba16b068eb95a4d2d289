As soon as it begins to grow, transfer mycelium away from the point of cloning to new dishes.  This way, you can isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminants.  You won't be doing strain isolation on a clone, so don't bother looking for rhizomorphs.  Just get healthy mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6449922</prev>\n<first>6449862</first>\n<last>6450199</last>\n<when>1168569802</when>\n<utime>01/12/07 04:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
