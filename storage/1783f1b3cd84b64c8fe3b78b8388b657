In fact, I wouldn't even snap the locks on the sides.  Put a 2&quot; layer of damp, not wet perlite in the bottom and you'll have 95% or better humidity without any sealing at all.  I have that same size container and it maintains humidity just fine with the lid put on at an angle so all four corners are open. Remember, you need air exchange in a fruiting chamber.  Lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5131689</next>\n<prev>5131601</prev>\n<first>5131506</first>\n<last>5131689</last>\n<when>1136240768</when>\n<utime>01/03/06 12:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
