Depending on your FAE it could be 1 time a day, none for a mono tub sometimes, or as many as 5 or more if you have something like a very holey shotgun terrarium. As far as spraying pins-I try not to spray them directly and I don't spray heavily, once again were just looking to bring the humidity back up after fanning. If you spray young pins they will abort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You were correct on the first 7 words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important for the cakes to lose water to evaporation.&amp;nbsp; This is the number one pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Even at 99% humidity such as in a shotgun terrarium, the fresh air supply will cause evaporation of moisture from the substrate.&amp;nbsp; This evaporated moisture needs to be replaced a few times daily with light misting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't mist to control humidity other than that the overspray from the mister re-wets the perlite, which then evaporates that moisture as humidity.&amp;nbsp; We mist to replace moisture in the substrates, and also to gently dampen the fruits themselves, since they absorb water from their surface, as well as water from the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misting young pins does not cause them to abort.&amp;nbsp; Allowing them to dry out does cause them to abort.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13518811</next>\n<prev>13518500</prev>\n<first>13416620</first>\n<last>13519029</last>\n<when>1290354773</when>\n<utime>11/21/10 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
