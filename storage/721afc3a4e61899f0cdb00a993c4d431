They might help to control smoke and cooking odors in your living room, but don't get an open jar of spawn or a syrnge anywhere near them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For mycology, you need a laminar flow HEPA filter.  The keyword there is laminar flow.  The fungi.com filter linked to above is what I use, and have for years.  The bigger you can afford the better, but the 12 X 24 works great.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6991892</next>\n<prev>6991883</prev>\n<first>6991805</first>\n<last>6991923</last>\n<when>1180645125</when>\n<utime>05/31/07 11:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
