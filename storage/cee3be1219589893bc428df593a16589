Besides, mold spores are killed by temps above 135F, so allowing them to germinate is a non-issue.&amp;nbsp; Your problem was sterile procedure during or after inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;penhed said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use worm castings...has the nitrogen boost you want plus benefical microbes...which are contam fighters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worm castings are in no way, shape, or form the equal of coffee grinds as a food source for fungi, and it's not just about nitrogen. There are many other compounds as well in a good supplement, coffee having over 200.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants.&amp;nbsp; Disregard NPK when dealing with fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;anonjon said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depends on the species. I'm not a big fan of it for cubensis. The gourmet growers use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small amounts of spent coffee grinds of the nature of 5% to 10% will increase yields by 25% or more.&amp;nbsp; Commercial growers may be more successful at making it work then cubensis growers because of their higher level of experience and attention to detail, coupled with a refusal to cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advising one to avoid coffee grinds despite the benefits, is like telling a kid to keep his tricycle forever because switching to a bicycle might cause him to skin his knees as he learns something new and more challenging.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14253138</next>\n<prev>14253059</prev>\n<first>14252621</first>\n<last>14257855</last>\n<when>1302204212</when>\n<utime>04/07/11 10:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
