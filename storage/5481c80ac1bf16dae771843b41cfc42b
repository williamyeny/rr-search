It's best to adjust greenhouses to about 90%, then use a casing layer over any substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps in a greenhouse to fill up all the empty shelf space with trays filled with damp perlite, in addition to running a humidifier.  These will help keep the humidity up, but the greenhouse is still better suited for bulk grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6042537</next>\n<prev>6041946</prev>\n<first>6041760</first>\n<last>6042592</last>\n<when>1157760386</when>\n<utime>09/09/06 03:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
