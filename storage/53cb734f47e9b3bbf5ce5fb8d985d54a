Elevated temperatures favor molds over mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review your sterile procedures.  Nobody has a worse mold-infested building to live in than I do, with black mold everywhere.  I can't wait to sell this place, but in the meantime I can grow mushrooms. . .  Very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold spores are introduced after sterilization, so check your inoculation and jar filtering procedures.  Department/hardware store hepa filters are worse than worthless.  They stir the air around, compounding the problem.  I have five or six of them sitting in my shed because they increased contaminaion, rather than the other way around.  You don't want strong drafts in your growing areas.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7830827</next>\n<prev>7829462</prev>\n<first>7829313</first>\n<last>7841004</last>\n<when>1199448077</when>\n<utime>01/04/08 02:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
