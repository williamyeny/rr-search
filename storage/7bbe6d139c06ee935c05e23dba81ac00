It worked fine.  With a mini greenhouse, I purposely made a very sloppy fitting door that is open from top to bottom.  This provides a constant air exchange which helps to stimulate pinning as well as to inhibit contaminant molds. As hyphae said, you must have a constant rate of evaporation from the casing surface for proper pin formation.  Stagnant air prevents that evaporation and encourages mold growth.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4667236</prev>\n<first>4666211</first>\n<last>4667654</last>\n<when>1126843588</when>\n<utime>09/16/05 07:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
