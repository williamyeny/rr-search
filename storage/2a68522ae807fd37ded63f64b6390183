Roadkill made and inoculated several cakes during the filming of the brf tek part of my DVD.  That was in early November of last year.  It's now May and they're still fruiting.  I moved them outdoors after the third flush and put them on top of some potted plants on the back deck.  I haven't counted, but they're on at least the 7th or 8th flush, perhaps more.<br />RR"}}
