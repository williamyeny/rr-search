Note how the substrate is fully colonized?  That means the coir is not serving as a casing, but as a substrate.  We all know cubes don't require a casing to pin and fruit, and a great strain will pin very well without one.  Coir as shown above, makes an excellent substrate.  If it weren't so darned expensive compared to manure which is free, it would be a substrate of choice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5668310</next>\n<prev>5668202</prev>\n<first>5661377</first>\n<last>5669062</last>\n<when>1148490660</when>\n<utime>05/24/06 08:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
