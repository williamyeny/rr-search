Remember, gypsum contains both calcium, a sweetner, and sulphur, which is sour.  Together, they work to hold a steady ph and avoid radical swings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum is not a substitute for lime.  You still need hydrated(water soluable) lime to get the ph right in the first place.  I shoot for a ph of 8 to 8.5 to start, knowing that as the mycelium colonizes the substrate, the metabolytes which are acidic will lower the ph to around 7 at the time of fruiting, which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the US, Best Hardware stores carry hydrated garden lime.  If your local store doesn't have it, you can order it online from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt;   Just go to that site and use the site search to type in hydrated lime.  They also have gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5740887</prev>\n<first>5739031</first>\n<last>5741223</last>\n<when>1150129659</when>\n<utime>06/12/06 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
