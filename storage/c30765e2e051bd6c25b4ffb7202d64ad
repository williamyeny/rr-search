Bacteria in relatively small amounts are beneficial in bulk substrates AND casing layers.

We're trying to kill the <u>mold spores</u>, which die at anything much above 125F or so.  Mold will ruin your bulk substrate.<br />Bacteria <i>and</i> mold will ruin your spawn, so that's why we sterilize our grains.  I've answered this exact question a few hundred times already.
