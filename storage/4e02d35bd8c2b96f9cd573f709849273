It doesn't work as well to rinse after the soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to accurately mix the water and grains together, then PC. The reason is that depending on humidity, your grains may be less or more dry then the grains the person who wrote the tek used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simmer for a few minutes after the soak, but DON'T allow grains to burst.  Burst kernels are bad because they release starch that leads to clumping, poor colonization, and bacterial infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your rye berries are twice the original dry size, and dry on the outside of the kernels, they are ready to be loaded into jars and PC'd regardless of what method you use to get to that point.  Remove any burst kernels you find.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6285884</next>\n<prev>6285756</prev>\n<first>6285569</first>\n<last>19912393</last>\n<when>1163614788</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 08:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
