One potential advantage of the addition of these end-substrate components is a significant reduction in the \"lag period.\"&nbsp; The lag period is seen when mushroom mycelium encounters unfamiliar components. (Leatham and Griffin, 1984; Raaska, 1990).<br />\"This simple step can greatly accelerate the mushroom life cycle, decreasing the duration of colonization prior to fruiting.\"<br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/chalkup.gif\" alt=\":chalkup:\" title=\":chalkup:\"/></blockquote><br />As I've posted many times over the years, I have found no evidence of this and in fact adding sawdust to agar slows down the agar colonization but does nothing to speed up the eventual bulk substrate colonization.&nbsp; <i>Theory</i> should not be stated or published as fact.&nbsp; <br />The entire notion of new substrate 'lag' is false.&nbsp; When you cut a wedge out of a petri dish, you slice through the growing cell structures.&nbsp; This takes 24 to 48 hours to heal and begin growing again, regardless of substrate.&nbsp; The same thing happens when you transfer from one petri dish to another with the same mix.<br />RR"}}
