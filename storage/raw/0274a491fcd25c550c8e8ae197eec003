What do you do? Are you busy posting in threads explaining to people that the tek they read in the archives is shitty? Or are you just not online that often cuz you have a busy life? I just don't see how you have time to post a comment in this thread, but you don't have time to go and delete shitty tek's that casue people to lose cakes,time, and money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be time much more well spent, considering they are the reason you are in this thread right now having to explain things to me, because I've went and read some bullshit info that was archived as a successful tek. Aren't the archives supposed to be a collection of the best info that has been acquired and posted throughout the history of this site? and is the go-to place for people looking to learn the best teks of all time? That's what I would consider an Archive to be. Unless you called it the &quot;Archive of bullshit&quot; then I would expect it to be a collection of all the bullshit that has been acquired and posted throughout the history of this site...Ya get me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, aren't you special?&amp;nbsp; And, you're an expert on my daily schedule too.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually responded to your thread and deleted some bad info, hopefully helping to save some other guy the wasted effort.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what really twists my pipe is assholes who can't say a simple 'thanks' for all the free help people on this board contribute at no benefit to themselves whatever. Our only reward is knowing we've helped someone else. Now, I see that isn't good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped back into your thread because I was going to offer to sticky it so people could post links to outdated info, and then I'd go in and nuke it during the few minutes a day I have to spend here.&amp;nbsp;  I'll just lock the damn thing instead.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/images/lock.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;This thread has been closed.&lt;/b&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15042998</prev>\n<first>15039016</first>\n<last>15043618</last>\n<when>1315425861</when>\n<utime>09/07/11 11:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
