My AA-921 runs 121F when it reaches 15 PSI.  After an hour of operation, the outside of the PC finally reaches 215F. The corresponding temperature to 15 psi is 250F, but that's on the &lt;i&gt;INside&lt;/i&gt; of the PC, not on the outside where it's exposed to room temperature air and much cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an infrared temperature sensor, point it at the rubber plug if you use an All American PC.  It will read 240F to 245F when the PC is at 15 psi/100 kpa.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7461745</next>\n<prev>7461275</prev>\n<first>7460786</first>\n<last>7466544</last>\n<when>1190939516</when>\n<utime>09/28/07 03:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
