I cut out the spots and sprayed with salt water though. Maybe miracle will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad idea.&amp;nbsp; Salt is toxic to fungi, so you just set your mushroom mycelium back.&amp;nbsp; Move it outdoors to a manure bed.&amp;nbsp; Next time, don't make grain lc.&amp;nbsp; I wish I had never posted that techinque years ago.&amp;nbsp; All it does is add another vector of contamination with no benefit.&amp;nbsp; Use grains to inoculate directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, never attempt to cut out mold. That spreads it even more.&amp;nbsp; As already said, your spawn was contaminated, and yes, exposure to light and fresh air will trigger the mold to be active towards sporulation, just like it does with mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14549740</next>\n<prev>14549693</prev>\n<first>14549464</first>\n<last>14550149</last>\n<when>1307019948</when>\n<utime>06/02/11 04:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
