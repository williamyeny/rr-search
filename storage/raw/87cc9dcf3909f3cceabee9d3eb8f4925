So there's cases where u'll have a fruit that actually contains multiple strains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people insist that they can see the sectoring on agar when they grow out a tissue sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say if the multiple strains are similar enough to have cooperated in the construction of single handsome (not a fucked up mutant) fruit, then for all intents and purposes they are the same strain. Especially when you consider that the transfer of genetic material in the mycelium is really a messy business. There's nucleii flying around all over the place. At some level the differences in genetic code becomes insignificant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to me yes a clone is an isolate, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is just flat-out wrong. It has nothing to do with multiple primordia 'intertwining' into a single fruit.&amp;nbsp; When that happens it's perfectly visible. In addition, not only strains can be cooperating together in a fruiting body, but other species as well, along with numerous species of bacteria.&amp;nbsp; The count can be dozens or more.&amp;nbsp; They are not all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An isolate is a single sector coherent mycelium network which will exhibit the exact same presentation every single time.&amp;nbsp; An isolate is selected for vigorous growth, abundant fruiting, great taste, potency, etc., and all but the best are discarded.&amp;nbsp; This culture can then be grown indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14486881</next>\n<prev>14486860</prev>\n<first>14486440</first>\n<last>14488886</last>\n<when>1305949505</when>\n<utime>05/21/11 06:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
