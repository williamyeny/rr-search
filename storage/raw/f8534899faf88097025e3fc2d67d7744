{"key":"post-9751015","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>9751015</id>\n<content>A &lt;i&gt;generation&lt;/i&gt; is when you go from spores to mycelium and back to spores again.&amp;nbsp; When the second batch of spores germinate, it's the second generation.&amp;nbsp; It's just like when your parents had you.&amp;nbsp; You became the second generation and when you have kids they'll be the third. (assuming for the sake of demonstration we consider your parents first generation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senescence has nothing to do with generations.&amp;nbsp; It has to do with the number of cell divisions since the strain originated by the pairing of two compatible hyphae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take third generation mycelium and print a fruit, when you germinate those spores, it's the fourth generation. Each time you do that there will be less genetic difference or variation between the various strains that arise.&amp;nbsp; You'll still want to isolate strains for potency if that's what your goal is.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9751181</next>\n<prev>9750983</prev>\n<first>9750667</first>\n<last>9751181</last>\n<when>1233964667</when>\n<utime>02/07/09 01:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
