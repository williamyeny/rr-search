Keep the casing layer&amp;nbsp; moist with several mistings per day. If humidity is low, you can lay a sheet of wax paper over the tray to hold humidity high right at the surface.&amp;nbsp; It might take several more days to see pins.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8581149</next>\n<prev>8576235</prev>\n<first>8567412</first>\n<last>8584265</last>\n<when>1214805645</when>\n<utime>06/30/08 09:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
