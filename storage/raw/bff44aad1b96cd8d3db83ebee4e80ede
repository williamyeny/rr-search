You need to break it up very well now and mix the colonized grains in with all the rest.  Just hold the bag in your hands and knead it like clay or bread dough. When it's mixed well, return it to your shelf to finish colonizing.  Try to avoid letting the grains contact the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really should have rinsed your grains prior to loading that bag.  Notice all the grain dust stuck to the side?  If that were a jar, it would be very hard to break up because all that grain dust makes the grains clump up and stick together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you mix the bag up, it will 'look' as though there is no mycelium in the bag.  Don't worry though, in 48 hours, you'll see it growing again, and in a week it should be finished.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5682982</next>\n<prev>5682859</prev>\n<first>5682859</first>\n<last>5682982</last>\n<when>1148831004</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 06:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
