Air doesn't get over-saturated because excess moisture falls to the ground. However, fruiting chambers don't rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the problem of the original poster is substrate moisture content, not humidity.&amp;nbsp; If it's too low or too high you'll get small fruits which open their caps early.&amp;nbsp; Lift the tray up so you can judge from weight if it's too dry or wet.&amp;nbsp; I suspect too dry.&amp;nbsp; You'd know if the substrate was too wet because the fruits would be waterlogged and heavy, even though they're small.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17163595</prev>\n<first>17160488</first>\n<last>17163881</last>\n<when>1352119564</when>\n<utime>11/05/12 02:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
