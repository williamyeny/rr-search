That's why your jars are contaminated.  They need an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you should leave the rocker off for the first five minutes of steam escaping, then put it on and allow pressure to build.  When the rocker first begins to jiggle, start your timer for one hour from that point and turn down the stove to the minimum setting that will maintain 15 PSI.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6225493</prev>\n<first>6224488</first>\n<last>6225579</last>\n<when>1162185183</when>\n<utime>10/30/06 07:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
