A good rule of thumb if you don't have a ph tester is to spread your casing to about 1/2&quot; thick, then lightly sprinkle the lime on the surface just to give the casing a 'whitish' look.  Don't turn the casing completely white, as that would be too much.  No need to mix the lime in if you do it that way.  It will gradually sink in as you mist. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1804625</next>\n<prev>1804267</prev>\n<first>1802679</first>\n<last>1805577</last>\n<when>1060672673</when>\n<utime>08/12/03 10:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
