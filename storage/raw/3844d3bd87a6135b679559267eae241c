You either get it free from starbucks, Dennys, IHOP, etc., or you use your own leftover grounds.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't lime substrates, and if you used a whole cup of hydrated lime in that small substrate, you'll be lucky if it ever colonizes.  Why would you use lime in a substrate?  Mushroom mycelium prefers acidic conditions of around 6 to 6.5 pH.  Your pH is going to be up around 10 now with all that lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8026371</next>\n<prev>8026286</prev>\n<first>8021889</first>\n<last>8083263</last>\n<when>1203091778</when>\n<utime>02/15/08 06:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
