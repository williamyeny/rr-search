Granted, I live in a mild climate, but the temperature regularly drops into the 60s indoors.   Jars colonize just fine, although a week or two later.  70 to 75 is perfect for cubes.  Copes like it a bit warmer.  Grow them in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5591032</prev>\n<first>5590976</first>\n<last>5591058</last>\n<when>1146789940</when>\n<utime>05/05/06 03:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
