The skin is blue.   mold spores on the other hand, look like a 'scab' that would form on your body, only thinner and green.  Mold spores will be above the mycelium or cake, and look like a dusting on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cake is damp, I've seen blue bruising transfer to a q-tip.  That's why I quit recommending that test a year or two ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8479790</next>\n<prev>8479584</prev>\n<first>8479253</first>\n<last>8479790</last>\n<when>1212525933</when>\n<utime>06/03/08 11:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
