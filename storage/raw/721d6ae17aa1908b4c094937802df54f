They're the most un-american and anti-working person company in business, not to mention the largest importer of 'made in china' crap in the entire world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news Roadz!  I noticed Lowes had verm last time I was there, but it was the little tiny bags for $5.  Hardly worth it.   I found two other places in our area that stock the thermorock, but they get $20/bag.  Check the phonebook for hydroponic supply places.  They have it, and large bags of coir too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6627548</next>\n<prev>6627475</prev>\n<first>6627012</first>\n<last>6628617</last>\n<when>1172854993</when>\n<utime>03/02/07 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
