Once pressure is reached, turn down your stove to the lowest setting that will allow a slight hiss, but no rattling. Order a nozzle now, and you should be able to find a gauge in AU from any boiler supply.&amp;nbsp; The thread size is 1/8&quot; NPT.&amp;nbsp; The boiler shop will know what that means.&amp;nbsp; 15 psi is the same as 100 kpa, or 1 atmosphere, if that's how the gauges are marked there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to lube the matching surfaces with Vaseline or olive oil.&amp;nbsp; It's also a good idea to remove the wing nuts, and grease the threads on the bolts.&amp;nbsp; This will make it tighten and loosen easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice score.&amp;nbsp; That would be a bargain at three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13156854</next>\n<prev>13156816</prev>\n<first>13156554</first>\n<last>13156968</last>\n<when>1283823537</when>\n<utime>09/07/10 04:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
