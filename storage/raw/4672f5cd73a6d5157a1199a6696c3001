Copes do best at about 80F, with high humidity and lots of air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primordia and pins are more delicate, so use care when misting or lay wax paper over them to cut down on the amount of misting required.  The growing pins will push the wax paper out of the way as they grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7708368</next>\n<prev>7708103</prev>\n<first>7706928</first>\n<last>7710915</last>\n<when>1196650641</when>\n<utime>12/03/07 04:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
