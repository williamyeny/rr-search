Turn the flash off, and use a light or two from 45 degree angles on each side of the jar.  This will reflect the glare away from your camera lens, allowing you to get a clear picture.  Use a tripod or book, etc to set the camera on for stability so the picture will be clear.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7112274</prev>\n<first>7112228</first>\n<last>7113387</last>\n<when>1183269723</when>\n<utime>07/01/07 09:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
