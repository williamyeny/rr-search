I came back and it was almost 200 degrees! I immediately took it off the burner to cool off a little. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, reduce the heat when the temp reaches 130F, since it will continue to ramp up.&amp;nbsp; For pasteurization of manure and straw, compost, etc., the closer you can keep the temp to 140F/60C the better.&amp;nbsp; Try not to allow the temp to exceed 160F at any time, so you were already over temp when you first reduced heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to be more likely to contaminate at this point, so if it were mine, I'd toss it out and consider this a trial run.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12898341</next>\n<prev>12897655</prev>\n<first>12897163</first>\n<last>12898341</last>\n<when>1279136528</when>\n<utime>07/14/10 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
