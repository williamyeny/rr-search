Feel free to use whatever suits you.  I've been making the rounds of the mushroom conferences and festivals over the last 25 years, so I generally use the most common pronunciations in that group.  If you listen to Gaston Guzman, Gordon Wasson, Stamets, Gary Lingoff, John Allen, etc., speak, it's the way they also say the words.  That doesn't make it right, just common in the mushroom community.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6990723</next>\n<prev>6990567</prev>\n<first>6990512</first>\n<last>6992111</last>\n<when>1180625543</when>\n<utime>05/31/07 06:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
