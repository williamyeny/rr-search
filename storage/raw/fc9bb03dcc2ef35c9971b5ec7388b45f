Lysol and alcohol are both surface disinfectants, and you don't dump spores or mycelium on the floor of the glovebox anyway so they are of no use.   Since all a glovebox does is prevent drafts that would blow contamination into your work, soap and water is all that is required to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6217119</next>\n<prev>6216957</prev>\n<first>6216597</first>\n<last>6220128</last>\n<when>1161954147</when>\n<utime>10/27/06 04:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
