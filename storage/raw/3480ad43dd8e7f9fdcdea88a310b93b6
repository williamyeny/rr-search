{"key":"post-6882424","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6882424</id>\n<content>For agar, I've found a long necked liquor bottle with a 1/4&quot; hole drilled into the lid and fitted with a synthetic filter disk works great.  Without something to hold it in place, it seems like that foam plug would blow out as the PC cooled after sterilization.  There's always more pressure in the agar bottle than in the PC as the PC cools down.  The lid with synthetic filter disk prevents the agar from boiling over.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6882345</prev>\n<first>6882105</first>\n<last>6882424</last>\n<when>1178510869</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 07:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
