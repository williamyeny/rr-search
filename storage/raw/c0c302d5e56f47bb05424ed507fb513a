It's going to flow at an airspeed of about 80-90 feet per minute, while 100 to 120 feet per minute is recommended.  Note it's output is 360 cubic feet per minute spread over 4 square feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For flowhood use, I'd let it run in a small room at least an hour before beginning work in order to scrub the ambient air clean.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7969907</next>\n<prev>7968699</prev>\n<first>7968486</first>\n<last>24863920</last>\n<when>1201993822</when>\n<utime>02/03/08 01:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
