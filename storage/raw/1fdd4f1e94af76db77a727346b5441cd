Psilocybin breaks down at 100 degrees CELCIUS. that's exactly the same temperature as 212 f, or boiling point of water (assuming sea level... boils about 15 degrees lower here) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on perpetuating a myth, you should provide scientific documentation.  I've seen no evidence that psilocybin breaks down at 100C/212F, and after many batches of tea where the end product was much more effective than eating raw mushrooms, I'm convinced otherwise.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a well known fact that the nutritional value of edible mushrooms is only fully realized upon cooking, so why would psilocybe mushrooms be any different?  The real-world experiences of thousands of growers who have boiled their product into tea speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6336050</next>\n<prev>6335825</prev>\n<first>6335320</first>\n<last>6336050</last>\n<when>1165341224</when>\n<utime>12/05/06 07:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
