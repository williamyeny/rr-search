Just toss in a few handfulls of substrate, then part of a jar of grains or other spawn, then another thin layer of each, etc., until full.  Make thin layers so they fill in the gaps quickly.  I've found this has less of a chance of breaking kernels of grain spawn which can allow contaminants to get a foothold in the uncolonized part in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, careful mixing works too and many growers do it that way.  I've just settled on the layerimg technique over the years because I've had a bit higher success rate with it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6657612</prev>\n<first>6654186</first>\n<last>6657665</last>\n<when>1173613526</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 02:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
