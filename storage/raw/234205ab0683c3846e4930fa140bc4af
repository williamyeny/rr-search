{"key":"post-7349113","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7349113</id>\n<content>Never heat a colonizing casing layer above room temperature.  That is the first mistake.  In addition, plain vermiculite is a very poor choice for casing pf cakes.  They're already 2/3 vermiculite when you make them.  Now you have diluted the small amount of brown rice flour which is the only source of food, even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to provide any humidty at all during casing run.  In fact, get the trays out of the tub with perlite and set them on a bookshelf.  Be sure that each tray is covered with foil.  If you still don't see any mycelium breaking through the verm in a few days, take the foil off and introduce to fruiting conditions at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I'd suggest a dunk and roll for brf cakes.  If you want more product, break up the cakes and spawn to manure or coir.  When that colonizes, add a casing layer of peat/verm mixed 50%/50%, and limed to pH 8.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7349085</prev>\n<first>7349085</first>\n<last>7349113</last>\n<when>1188427505</when>\n<utime>08/30/07 01:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
