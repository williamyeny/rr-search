Mist them 3ish times daily. Keep a light above them 6-10 hours a day in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, follow the tek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/8&quot; holes are only 25% as large as 1/4&quot; holes.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, and you're only getting a fraction of the fresh air you need, thus the poor pinning performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light should be on 12 hours per day and it should be within a few inches of the terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap hygrometers are useless.&amp;nbsp; Read the fruits.&amp;nbsp; Yours show no signs of low humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closets are horrible places to grow because there's not enough air circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taping holes on a properly made shotgun terrarium reduces humidity, as does using the wrong size holes.&amp;nbsp; It's the airflow through the bottom holes which absorbs moisture from the perlite.&amp;nbsp; Adding more perlite won't help if you didn't build the terrarium right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make a new terrarium following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium tek&lt;/a&gt; and you'll be fine.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to read about lighting at the bottom of that page too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18920407</next>\n<prev>18914685</prev>\n<first>18913322</first>\n<last>18923957</last>\n<when>1380628846</when>\n<utime>10/01/13 03:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
