Try harder. You want to shake it not to see if you can break it up but rather to see if, once you've broken it up and shaken it around, the mycelium will recolonize. You'll know it's got bacteria (which isn't super visible by itself) if the mycelium doesn't recolonize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a jar of grains doesn't break apart by banging on a tire or phone book, it's a good sign of bacteria contamination.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium will easily break apart by using a tire or phone book to beat the jar against.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13248701</next>\n<prev>13248549</prev>\n<first>13244735</first>\n<last>13266028</last>\n<when>1285518962</when>\n<utime>09/26/10 07:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
