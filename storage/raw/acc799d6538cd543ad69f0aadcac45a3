It sounds like bacteria from your description of jelly like film around the grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem wasn't caused by shaking.  The jars were lost already anyway.  Mycelium contaminated by bacteria can be perfectly white, so that's why you didn't see it before.   After a few grows, you learn to recognize the 'melting ice cream' look of a bacteria contaminated jar.  Another indicator is they're often hard to shake.  Non-contaminated mycelium should break up fairly easily when you shake, especially if you bang the jar against a tire or phone book.   However, a grain jar contaminated with bacteria will be like a big blob of rubber when you try to shake it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They'll also smell like garbage, rather than fresh mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7215342</next>\n<prev>7214027</prev>\n<first>7213732</first>\n<last>7216077</last>\n<when>1185232514</when>\n<utime>07/24/07 02:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
