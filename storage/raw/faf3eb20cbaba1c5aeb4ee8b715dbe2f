There is really no standard.  Sometimes they get more potent, other times less.  It's just the nature of the beast.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I toss out trays after the second flush. (actually take them to the local botanical gardens, where they fertilize with horse manure from the mounted police department stables...lol) By that time, you've already harvested nearly 80% of the total you'll get anyway, so the real estate in your grow area is better suited to a new tray.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5943373</prev>\n<first>5943036</first>\n<last>5943383</last>\n<when>1155045410</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 04:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
