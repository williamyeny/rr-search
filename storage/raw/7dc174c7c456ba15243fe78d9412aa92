In the morning, it's around 73, by evening, it gets to about 80. I don't have the option of using an A/C but if anyone has an idea that they could spit ball me, let me know. Here are some pics from today Oh. and fyi, I have the windows already covered with cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Remove the polyfill completely.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Mist as required to make up for lost moisture.&amp;nbsp; This will provide best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; 73F to 80F is great. They'll fruit fine up to about 90F even. Don't run the AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Get the cardboard off the window!&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms require light to develop properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; There is no benefit to misting the walls of the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; Mist the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Get rid of the fan.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16096739</next>\n<prev>16096708</prev>\n<first>16095457</first>\n<last>16127784</last>\n<when>1334587187</when>\n<utime>04/16/12 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
