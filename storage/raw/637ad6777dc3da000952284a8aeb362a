{"key":"post-7013494","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7013494</id>\n<content>I don't know what to tell you other than what I said above.  Use your glovebox on the next batch and fruit the cakes as cakes, rather than spawning to bulk or casing.  Do a dunk and roll when you birth and be sure to wash off the verm barrier under running water.  That's the part that will be harboring any contaminants that were picked up during colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said above, any time I've seen contaminants on or before first flush, they came from the spawn.  As an experiment, I saved back two jars of peat/verm casing that I made several months ago when doing the casing tek for my DVD.  They have no lids or filters, only a foil covering.  There is still no mold growing in them after all this time.  Make sure you're &lt;i&gt;pasteurizing&lt;/i&gt; your casing material.  If you sterilize or use a microwave, there's a chance it won't survive to first flush, but if you properly pasteurize and it still molds, then the mold came from your spawn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7013522</next>\n<prev>7013099</prev>\n<first>7000584</first>\n<last>7015382</last>\n<when>1181098237</when>\n<utime>06/06/07 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
