If you spray large droplets on your fruits, then leave them wet, they'll abort.  Mist with plain water.  Don't add peroxide or bleach, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to avoid misting during the primordia formation stage.  That's a good time to cover the tray with wax paper to hold in the humidity.  Once the primordia turn into pins, resume misting, but just increase air exchange afterward until they dry off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6657635</prev>\n<first>6655770</first>\n<last>6657669</last>\n<when>1173613939</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 02:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
