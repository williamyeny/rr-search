They only provide a draft free place to work, so that the wind does not blow contaminants into your work. I use one with simply having holes cut for my arms.  I wear latex gloves and tyvek wrist sleeves, which fit snugly when my arms are inserted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to only use one glovebox, I'd suggest cutting the holes large enough for your arms, and then cut some plastic to fit around the hole with slices so that it closes the gap most of the way when the lady uses it.  You could also simply buy two rubbermaid containers to use for gloveboxes and make one for her with smaller holes.  The boxes are only $6 to $10 each, so it won't break the bank to have two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a picture of our fellow moderator Roadkill using my glovebox, so you can get an idea of how the tyvek sleeves and open holes work.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-16/699192866-380177095-Jim_at_glovebox.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-16/699192866-thumb_380177095-Jim_at_glovebox.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*please use this picture here at the Shroomery bro*&lt;br /&gt;-Roadkill</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6854368</next>\n<prev>6854160</prev>\n<first>6854121</first>\n<last>6854458</last>\n<when>1177966360</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 11:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
