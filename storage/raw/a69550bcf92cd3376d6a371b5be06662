I think that's how they made this light ring I bought for my microscope. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microscopesusa.com/LED_ring_light.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.microscopesusa.com/LED_ring_light.html&lt;/a&gt; It sure give true color and is great for pictures because it doesn't screw with the light balance on my camera.  The automatic setting works fine.  It beats the halogen I did have, that's for sure. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6337244</next>\n<prev>6337146</prev>\n<first>6336515</first>\n<last>6342084</last>\n<when>1165361559</when>\n<utime>12/06/06 01:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
