Don't use an incubator.&amp;nbsp; If your pasteurized casing material(which you didn't identify) contaminated prior to first flush, it means your grain spawn was already contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11708487</next>\n<prev>11706641</prev>\n<first>11706641</first>\n<last>11708487</last>\n<when>1261614234</when>\n<utime>12/24/09 02:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
