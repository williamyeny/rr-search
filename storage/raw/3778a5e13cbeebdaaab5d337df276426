I incubate them at recommended temperature in a clear plastic terrarium with aquarium heater set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Popcorn is inferior in every way to cereal grains such as rye and wheat.&amp;nbsp; You also should pressure cook it for 2 hours, not 1.&amp;nbsp; You didn't mention flame sterilization of the needle or tools, or your filter set up on the jars, but you did say you don't use a glovebox, which are all reasons for failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it's been recommended for ten years around here not to use incubators as they tend to increase the rate of contamination exponentially.&amp;nbsp; Colonize jars on an open bookshelf at normal room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13623120</next>\n<prev>13622472</prev>\n<first>13622338</first>\n<last>13623726</last>\n<when>1292205551</when>\n<utime>12/13/10 03:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
