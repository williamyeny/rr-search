There's a picture in stamets' TMC of what appears to be a normal casing layer identified as overlay, so those who read that book tend to freak out if they see their casing colonizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your cubensis pinsets are better with a casing layer, you might want to check your humidity levels.&amp;nbsp; A casing layer applied late mainly serves to provide a beneficial micro-climate conducive to pinhead formation.&amp;nbsp; In other words, it holds humidity right at the surface of the substrate where primordia form.&amp;nbsp; Wax paper does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What wax paper won't do is provide moisture to support the flush, so make sure you have good substrate water content.&amp;nbsp; I like to make substrates on the dry side so they'll colonize faster and be less susceptible to contaminants, and then soak for an hour or two after colonization before exposing to fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; This puts the moisture you need for flushing into the bulk substrate at that time.&amp;nbsp; You can just fill up the tray and let the substrate block sit in the water for that hour or two(or three) and then dump out any excess water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9559456</next>\n<prev>9558699</prev>\n<first>9556841</first>\n<last>9595249</last>\n<when>1231290041</when>\n<utime>01/07/09 03:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
