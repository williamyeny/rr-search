If you can maintain 70 to 75, they'll do fine. 80 might give a day or two faster colonization, but contamination problems, especially bacteria will also increase. It's no secret I hate incubators.  They cause way more problems then they solve.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5201768</next>\n<prev>5201717</prev>\n<first>5201717</first>\n<last>5201768</last>\n<when>1137761747</when>\n<utime>01/20/06 02:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
