Bleach doesn't kill fungi.&amp;nbsp; It's why some people pasteurize in very strong bleach water.&amp;nbsp; It kills bacteria but not molds/fungi. It's always best to toss out contaminated substrates.&amp;nbsp; They infect future grows and make your efforts counterproductive.&amp;nbsp; New growers often report just what you are, but after a few months they come back and say they'll never do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempting to cut trich out of a substrate doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium is white and mixes with the mushroom mycelium.&amp;nbsp; It's only the spores that are green.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it spreads the spores everywhere, raising your ambient trich load, and contaminating future grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10731893</next>\n<prev>10731669</prev>\n<first>10731669</first>\n<last>10731915</last>\n<when>1248447218</when>\n<utime>07/24/09 05:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
