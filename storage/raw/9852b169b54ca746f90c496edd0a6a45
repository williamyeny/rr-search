It can't be used well in pf cakes, but in casing layers it helps to break up the peat and provide lots of O2 in casing layer, which stiumlates pins.  Of course, peat moss can be used without any vermiclite or perlite at all.  Just lime to balance Ph, and use gypsum at ten percent by volume of the amount of peat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6401751</next>\n<prev>6401621</prev>\n<first>6401498</first>\n<last>6401751</last>\n<when>1166985704</when>\n<utime>12/24/06 08:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
