{"key":"post-7298217","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7298217</id>\n<content>I've had perhaps ten jars of rye contaminate out of the last few thousand.  Sterile procedure is the key.  You don't need to sterilize or otherwise clean the jars before loading.  In fact, after I empty a jar, I wash it with soap and water, and then it's left on a shelf to dry/store until I need it again.  When I re-use the jars, I simply pick them off the shelf and fill up.  They don't even get rinsed, because it's not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who is losing more than ten percent of jars is either not following sterile procedure, or you have a poor choice of jar filter/lid setup.  Contaminants, especially molds, enter &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; sterilization of the grains, so your filters must be of a micron size to stop mold spores and bacteria, and must be totally dry at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inoculate in a glove box, or preferably in front of a laminar flow hood, and it's best to use agar wedges because you know if it's contaminated or not.  The two dimensional space of a petri dish makes it possible to look at your entire culture before you transfer it.  I suspect many of you who are having troubles with grains are actually inoculating with contaminated cultures.   BRF is more forgiving, but grains, and especially rye will grow anything that lands on them, so you have to pay special attention to proper sterile procedure.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7298831</next>\n<prev>7287935</prev>\n<first>7248492</first>\n<last>7303980</last>\n<when>1187218559</when>\n<utime>08/16/07 01:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
