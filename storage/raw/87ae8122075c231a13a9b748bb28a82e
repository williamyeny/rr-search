A PC is best, but if you can't afford one, boil much longer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, since the mold is originating from the injection sites, the mold was introduced at inoculation.  It' extremely important to use a glove box, flame sterilize your needle until it's red hot, then squirt out a bit of solution to cool the needle before injecting it into your jar.  Wear latex gloves.  Remember, YOU as the grower are the greatest source of contamination in mushroom growing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4514746</next>\n<prev>4510935</prev>\n<first>4510853</first>\n<last>4517716</last>\n<when>1123605762</when>\n<utime>08/09/05 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
