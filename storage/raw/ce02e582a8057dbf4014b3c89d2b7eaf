Mushrooms eat their food just like humans and produce body heat as they metabolise the food, just like humans.  They also release the carbon in their food as CO2 just like humans.  Therefore, they need solid food, not just nutrients.  Their preferred food in artificial cultivation seems to be grains, such as rye and rice.  You can expand your harvest by using large amounts of less nutritious foods for the mycelium such as manure and coir.  You won't find a 'nutrient' that you can add to the solid food that will enhance the crop much, if any at all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7796222</next>\n<prev>7796165</prev>\n<first>7796012</first>\n<last>7813316</last>\n<when>1198541228</when>\n<utime>12/25/07 02:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
