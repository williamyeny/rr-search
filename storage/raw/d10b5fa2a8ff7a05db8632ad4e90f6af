Is there any way to make a determination? From what I've read about determining if it is bluing or mold, if I take a wet Q-tip and if it rubs off blue... it would be mold. I've done so and nothing comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a link to where the heck you found that bad info so I can nuke it.&amp;nbsp; There is no q-tip test.&amp;nbsp; It's bunk because bruised mycelium will easily rub off.&amp;nbsp; What you have is obvious bruising, not mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mist from birthing to harvest, and you mist the cakes and perlite.&amp;nbsp; Misting the sides of the chamber is a waste of time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep plenty of bright light 12/12 through harvest.&amp;nbsp; Light is much more important after pinning than before, although it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a secondary pinning trigger.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14319571</next>\n<prev>14319511</prev>\n<first>14319429</first>\n<last>14323368</last>\n<when>1303265722</when>\n<utime>04/20/11 05:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
