You can half-ass a substrate and still get a crop.  You can half-ass a fruiting chamber and still get a crop.  You can half-ass on air exchange and still get a crop.  You can half-ass on humidity and still get a crop.  However, if you skimp on all of them, you get nothing.  If you work hard on every aspect of growing, you'll get spectacular results.
