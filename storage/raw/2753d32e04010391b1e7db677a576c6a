What is often mistaken for one type of mycelium is actually this pile of various types, or even the same type.  If your cakes are in the FC and fuzzing up, they're good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should NOT see condensation on the sides of the terrarium, especially with holes in the sides for air exchange.  Condensation indicates one thing and one thing only: A temperature differential between inside and outside the FC.  It does not indicate humidity in any way, shape, or form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest a quality, $12 hygrometer from a cigar shop and calibrate it weekly at first, and then you can go to monthly calibrations after it breaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that style terrarium, you have lots of air exchange, so naturally, you need to mist to make up for the moisture that is evaporating from your substrate.  A steady rate of evaporation from the substrate along with full colonization and a high rate of air exchange are three of the five major pinning triggers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9117471</next>\n<prev>7161967</prev>\n<first>7161905</first>\n<last>19722985</last>\n<when>1184201531</when>\n<utime>07/12/07 03:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
