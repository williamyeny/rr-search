I don't ever recommend trying to save a casing with trichoderma. The mushrooms are perfectly safe to eat, but the tray is toast.  Toss it, or at least move it outside.  If the weather is warm enough, it will flush again outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4745060</next>\n<prev>4744969</prev>\n<first>4744969</first>\n<last>4750671</last>\n<when>1128273934</when>\n<utime>10/02/05 08:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
