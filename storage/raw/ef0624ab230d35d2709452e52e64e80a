At this time, transfer some of the mycelium to your agar mix to isolate away from any contaminants that may be growing along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 20 grams agar agar, 20 grams malt dextrose, and 2 grams brewers yeast per liter of water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6609326</next>\n<prev>6609009</prev>\n<first>6609009</first>\n<last>6611293</last>\n<when>1172441463</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 12:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
