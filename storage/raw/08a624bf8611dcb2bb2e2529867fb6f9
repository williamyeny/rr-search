Why is nothing happening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the good information out there, why you guys are still using 'casings' to refer to &lt;i&gt;projects&lt;/i&gt; is beyond me.&amp;nbsp; That does nothing to describe what you're doing, nor how you're going about it.&amp;nbsp; 'Casing' is a verb, and describes the ACT of putting a &lt;i&gt;casing layer&lt;/i&gt; over a fully colonized substrate.&amp;nbsp; The word 'casings' does not exist in the terminology of mycology, because in the English language there is no plural form to verbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mentioned 'microwave' above.&amp;nbsp; If you used a microwave for anything related to mycology, that's probably the reason you're failing.&amp;nbsp; Try to describe in detail what you did, and then you can get some accurate info on how to avoid those mistakes in the future.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9847881</next>\n<prev>9833442</prev>\n<first>9803649</first>\n<last>9847881</last>\n<when>1235160741</when>\n<utime>02/20/09 10:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
