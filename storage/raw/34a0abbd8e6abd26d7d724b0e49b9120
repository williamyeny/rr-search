You have to have a sterile environment when putting a cake into a chamber....Especially when its colonizing. Otherwise it is just going to pick up contams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your pissing match somewhere else.&amp;nbsp; This isn't your thread.&amp;nbsp; Fruiting chambers are not, and need not be sterile.&amp;nbsp; You practice sterile technique during the spawn stage, not the fruiting stage when LOTS of fresh air is needed, and it can come from an open window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster,&lt;br /&gt;Plants in terrariums have been tried many times, nearly always with failure.&amp;nbsp; Plants don't appreciate the high humidity that mushrooms require, and they end up getting mildew and other plant diseases, some of which can spread to your mushroom substrate, such as cobweb and fungus gnats.&amp;nbsp; They also don't consume anywhere near enough CO2 to help your mushroom grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, from what I've read... being able to &quot;see&quot; your cakes/casing is enough light for fruit bodys to form. What would you suggest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've read that too, and every time it makes me want to shoot whomever wrote it, since it's blatantly false, but disinformation keeps getting repeated here and it fucks up people's grows.&amp;nbsp; Find a very&amp;nbsp; bright window, or look for a fluorescent fixture with tubes in the 6,500 Kelvin range.&amp;nbsp; That's the color that has shown to produce the best pinsets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd get rid of the ultrasonic too.&amp;nbsp; You want your substrate to begin to dry out slightly, and then moistureize it via misting.&amp;nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Substrates that are waterlogged or have a steady-state moisture level perform poorly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10721944</next>\n<prev>10721796</prev>\n<first>10715890</first>\n<last>10730784</last>\n<when>1248303155</when>\n<utime>07/23/09 01:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
