The rust on the threads act like a brake pad against the glass.  Rust on the lids themselves doesn't hurt until it's so bad, you don't get a seal against the glass. You can prolong their life by rubbing the rust off with a dry paper towel, or one of those green scouring pads.  Get it off the threads on the lid ring too.  Most of my synthetic filter disks are stained red from using rusty lids.  I have some that have been through hundreds of uses over the years.  The rust itself is not toxic to you or your mycelium. (unless you cut yourself on a rusty lid, in which case get a tetnus shot)&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6946829</next>\n<prev>6946762</prev>\n<first>6946295</first>\n<last>6946900</last>\n<when>1179768152</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
