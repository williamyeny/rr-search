By early September, it's back to 24/7. I have all the dead wood on my property to supply my own firewood for the rest of my life, so it's free heat. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine heating in this climate with electricity or oil.&amp;nbsp; Gosh, that would break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said, your temps are too high, and it takes about a week to ten days to see growth.&amp;nbsp; Put your jars on an open bookshelf so air can circulate around them and forget they're there for another week.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10339430</next>\n<prev>10338809</prev>\n<first>10338342</first>\n<last>10339430</last>\n<when>1242341802</when>\n<utime>05/15/09 01:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
