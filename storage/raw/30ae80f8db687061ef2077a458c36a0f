Upon what are you basing 100% success? You've only boiled your jars for the amount of time recommended for pressure cooking.  If there are any endospores in your grains at all, you're doomed.  Not all batches have endospores, but most do.  That's why we use pressure cookers for grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7728394</next>\n<prev>7728048</prev>\n<first>7727845</first>\n<last>7733281</last>\n<when>1197048301</when>\n<utime>12/07/07 07:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
