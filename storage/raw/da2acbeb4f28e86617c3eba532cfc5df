I would make sure that the tape was going over the edge of the fold and onto the bag on both sides to make sure no air would get through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the problem.&amp;nbsp; You MUST have a plenum of air in the top of the bag for the mushroom mycelium to use.&amp;nbsp; If you fold down the bag and try to colonize it without an air pocket, you'll find that molds which can tolerate a much higher CO2 level than mushroom mycelium will easily take over and ruin your grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterilize the bags with a tyvek sleeve inserted as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Sawdust-Woodchips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;sawdust/woodchip chapter of Let's Grow Mushrooms.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This will prevent contaminants from entering as the bags cool and also keep them from exploding in the pressure cooker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PulseEden said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no reason why you couldn't pre-seal any bag. So long as the air pressure is the same inside and outside the bag (which it will be in the pressure cooker), the bag will not expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure inside the bag and outside will not be the same except during the half hour or so that the PC and the bags are at full temperature.&amp;nbsp; During the ramp up to 15 psi, pressure in the cooker rises faster than pressure inside the bag, and then during cool-down, pressure leaves the pressure cooker faster than the bag can cool and release its pressure.&amp;nbsp; The result is inflated and/or burst bags.&amp;nbsp; As said above, tyvek sleeves in each bag as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Sawdust-Woodchips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; ameliorates the problem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15251604</next>\n<prev>15251556</prev>\n<first>15247393</first>\n<last>21992146</last>\n<when>1319129887</when>\n<utime>10/20/11 07:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
