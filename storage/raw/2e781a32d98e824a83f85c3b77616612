With a turbulent breeze, cobweb mold won't have a chance.  If and when you do see a bit of cobweb, just douse it with some 3% peroxide straight from the bottle.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterilizing casing material makes it much more succeptable to cobweb and other contaminants.  Lately, I've been using peat/verm casings with no pasteurization or other heat treatment whatsoever, and the contamination rate hasn't gone up at all.  However, massive air exchange is taking place.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said above, 98% is too high a humidity to maintain during fruiting.  It will encourage mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, I ran a bunch of tests with commercial fungicides.  I was even able to fruit off rye berries without pressure cooking them.  Casing material treated with Banrot 40wp can't grow cobweb or trichoderma, penicillin, whatever.  Fungicides work by stopping fungal spores from being able to germinate.  They don't seem to effect live mycelium.  However, as home growers, we're not interested in bottom line profits, but in a better and safer product.  I still have half a pound or so of fungicide that I won't use, but for some reason never tossed out.  It isn't necessary if the precautions given throughout this thread are followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to filter the air going into your greenhouse.  Just make sure there are enough places for the air to exit that it reaches all parts.  You don't want any stratification of layers, or cobweb will thrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to kill any cobweb you find as SOON as you find it.  Cobweb spreads not by spores, but by breaking off fine filiments of mycelium that then ride the air currents to a new location.  If cobweb ever gets really bad such as in your case, millions of tiny pieces of mycelium are floating around your house looking for a suitable substrate.   You'll probably want to bathe everything in peroxide, then remove it all and bleach bomb your greenhouse area. You can even take your substrates into the shower with you to wash the heck out of them.  Any damage that occurs is less than the damage of uncontrolled cobweb.  After it airs back out, keep a really close eye on things until you beat back the cobweb with repeated applications of peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, the above concerns cobweb.  If and when you spot green molds, show zero tolerance for fixing them.  You need to carefully bag up any project with green, and take it outside as soon as you see it, and bury in a shady spot in your yard.  They will often recover in the ground and surpise you with fruits after a rain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5996176</next>\n<prev>5993478</prev>\n<first>5992477</first>\n<last>6813298</last>\n<when>1156530478</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 09:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
