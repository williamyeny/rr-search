If you heated the interior of your jars to 250F, the grains would be drier than they were at the store when you bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air is a terrible conductor of heat.  Water will transfer heat into a substrate for pasteurizing much faster than air will.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5641386</next>\n<prev>5641030</prev>\n<first>5640554</first>\n<last>5649231</last>\n<when>1147873043</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 04:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
