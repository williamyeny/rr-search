Would it be possible to inject H2O2 into the jar and onto the mold, more or less? I'd also like to point out that most of my jars also have condensation in them (if that matters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't do that.&amp;nbsp; It looks like mushroom mycelium which can be cottony or rhizomorphic, or both in the same jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation is normal. It's warmer inside the jars than outside.&amp;nbsp; Get them out of that silly box and put them on a shelf in the open.&amp;nbsp; They'll do far better that way where they can breath.&amp;nbsp; You don't need to wipe them down with alcohol or peroxide either.&amp;nbsp; The verm filter will keep the contents clean unless you disturb it enough to move it around, which then allows contaminants to get right in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>18524713</prev>\n<first>18524453</first>\n<last>18527193</last>\n<when>1373251233</when>\n<utime>07/08/13 05:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
