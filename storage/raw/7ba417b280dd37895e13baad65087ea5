You're not likely to see any problems in your lifetime.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahem.  Mushrooms release spores into the air by the billions.  Where the wind takes those spores to land is completely random.  The chances of spores from the same cap landing in the same place to mate with other spores from the same cap, generation after generation for hundreds of thousands of years is nil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms breed and cross strains with other mushrooms of the same species in nature.  That's why the wild strains we isolate have much more vigor than the ones we cultivate.  Changing substrate does not change genetics.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5839412</next>\n<prev>5838923</prev>\n<first>5837568</first>\n<last>5839431</last>\n<when>1152478948</when>\n<utime>07/10/06 12:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
