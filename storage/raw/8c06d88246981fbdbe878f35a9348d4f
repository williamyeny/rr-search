{"key":"post-7013459","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7013459</id>\n<content>Fractional sterilization has been around for years.  It works about 50% of the time.  However, a few failures mean the cost of the grains and your lost time outweigh any savings from not buying a pressure cooker.  My advice is to stick to the pf tek until you can afford a PC.  Pf cakes can be spawned to bulk, and work very well.  You can generate more spawn in less time with rye or wbs, but I'd suggest waiting until you have a pressure cooker.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7013483</next>\n<prev>7013438</prev>\n<first>7013171</first>\n<last>7013932</last>\n<when>1181097751</when>\n<utime>06/06/07 05:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
