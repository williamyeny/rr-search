{"key":"post-8561768","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8561768</id>\n<content>Instructions for posting pictures below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been brought to our attention that the shroomery is reaching the end of our bandwidth rope.&amp;nbsp; We've got to cut down on the stored and posted pictures to free up some space.&amp;nbsp; Any old or BS/off topic pictures you folks have in your galleries should be deleted.&amp;nbsp; That step alone will free up lots of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When posting pictures, do NOT use the attach file link.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I believe jpeg files can no longer be attached that way.&amp;nbsp; We need to only have thumbnail images in a post, NOT the whole darn picture which wastes bandwidth and kills members with slow internet connections. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Post Pictures:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the upper left corner of your screen, right below where it says Welcome 'your user name', click the link that says &lt;u&gt;Pics&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In the window that comes up, click the link to &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Upload&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Browse your hard drive to find the picture, and then click 'open' followed by clicking the Upload button.&amp;nbsp; Please reduce your images to 200K or less before uploading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After uploading, you'll see a box below your picture with some code.&amp;nbsp; Highlight and copy this code, and then paste it into the body of your message wherever you want the thumbnail to appear.&amp;nbsp; When someone clicks the thumbnail, they'll get the full sized picture, but they won't have to download the whole file everytime they open the thread.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post pictures this way.&amp;nbsp; Making huge files appear in a thread is not only a waste of bandwidth, but slows down the experience for everyone.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has questions on how to post pics, ask them here.&amp;nbsp; I'll lock the thread once the proper posting procedure is clear.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, please browse your galleries and journals, etc., for bandwidth pigs you can delete. Thanks guys and gals.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8561776</next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>8561768</first>\n<last>19627095</last>\n<when>1214408492</when>\n<utime>06/25/08 06:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
