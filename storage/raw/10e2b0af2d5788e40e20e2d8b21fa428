I've noticed that if you don't, they won't fruit for that week anyway, but that extra week in the FC starts them drying out.  If you go a full week past full colonization and then do a dunk and roll, they start pinning almost right away.  I'd do them all at once.  Keep humidity at 99% and give as much fresh air as you can.  My terrariums look like I shot them with a shotgun.  They're drilled full of holes everywhere, sides, top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6590960</next>\n<prev>6590758</prev>\n<first>6590758</first>\n<last>6590960</last>\n<when>1172026219</when>\n<utime>02/21/07 04:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
