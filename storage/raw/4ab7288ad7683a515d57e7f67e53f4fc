No I don't think I know it all and what I do know iv learned from youtube and here. To re-cap a bit you say incubators are not needed.. OK but from what Iv read temps should be in the high 80's to low 90's. I live in a worm area southern CA but even here is gets a bit chilly at night wont that slow growth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the worms for fishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal room temperature is superior for colonizing mushroom substrates, NOT the 80s.&amp;nbsp; You don't find experienced growers telling you to use 'incubators' if your house is comfortable for you in a t-shirt.&amp;nbsp; Commercial mushroom farms colonize substrates at 69F tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful reading advice posted here, or written in books over five years ago.&amp;nbsp; We've learned a LOT since then.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11698665</next>\n<prev>11698410</prev>\n<first>11676286</first>\n<last>11726856</last>\n<when>1261507889</when>\n<utime>12/22/09 08:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
