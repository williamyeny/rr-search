Your contention that BRF isn't 'nutritious' is in error.  Have you ever noticed a 1/2 pint brf cake flushing?  There's only a few tablespoons of brown rice flour in a cake.  No other grain will perform as well in such small quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure your experiment will work if you get the moisture content right.  It's difficult to get various sized grains and flour all at the right water content.  Vermiculite holds more water than any grains, so when you mix the verm in with whole grains such as rice or wbs, the moisture equalizes during the sterilization cycle, often over-wetting the grains and leaving the verm drier than it should be.  Good luck and let us know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7496469</next>\n<prev>7496437</prev>\n<first>7496371</first>\n<last>7591984</last>\n<when>1191846606</when>\n<utime>10/08/07 03:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
