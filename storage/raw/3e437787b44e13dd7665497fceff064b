Metal lids already have a rubber seal, but most of us use the rubber side up to make the lids easier to get off.  Gasses will take the path of least resistance, which is going to be through the vent holes and filter rather than through the metal/glass interface that is pressed together tight.  If you're talking about the injection port, it would be hard to seal the tyvek unless you cut a square and glued it over the vent holes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6733239</next>\n<prev>6733042</prev>\n<first>6733042</first>\n<last>6733239</last>\n<when>1175396877</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
