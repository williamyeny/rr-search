It is NOT SAFE in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides; sealing the container will force the container within to have a &quot;low pressure&quot; within the container, while bring the PC up to pressure will and can sometimes crush the object. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 35 years of mushroom growing, I've never crushed a jar in the PC.&amp;nbsp; I'm assuming by 'negative pressure' you actually mean vacuum?&amp;nbsp; If so, jars are built to hold a vacuum.&amp;nbsp; In addition, you're supposed to let the steam pressure in a pressure cooker return to ambient slowly, not all at once.&amp;nbsp; A major cause of cracked jars is people who pop the weight off a PC to vent steam.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you say 'manufacturers instructions', I'm assuming you're referring to canning instructions where you must leave the lids loose so the item being canned can vent steam during the process.&amp;nbsp; That's the correct method for canning.&amp;nbsp; However, we're sterilizing and there's a big difference.&amp;nbsp; We're not pulling a long-term vacuum in our jars for preservation, thus we can seal the lids down tight prior to the PC cycle.&amp;nbsp; In addition, we use jars with holes in the lids and filters which allow for pressure equalization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10916135</next>\n<prev>10440551</prev>\n<first>7153712</first>\n<last>10916928</last>\n<when>1250999946</when>\n<utime>08/23/09 06:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
