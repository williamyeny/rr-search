I figure they're getting moisture outside from humidity and internally via the cake/reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's faulty reasoning.&amp;nbsp; Humidity simply slows the loss of moisture from your fruits, but does not replenish it.&amp;nbsp; That is what misting is for and should be done regardless of reservoir or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for substrate moisture is if it's enough, it's enough.&amp;nbsp; If your substrate is performing well under your current regime and not drying out, don't soak.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15582131</next>\n<prev>15582092</prev>\n<first>15582005</first>\n<last>15582131</last>\n<when>1325089502</when>\n<utime>12/28/11 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
