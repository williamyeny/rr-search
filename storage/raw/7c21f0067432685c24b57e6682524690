If the jar and grains were heated to a temperature above 100c, the jar would be totally dry unless you had a non-vented lid on it, in which case you're cooking a bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're making liquid culture, why would you want to use the oven to boil the liquid?  Without pressure you can't get the liquid to exceed 100c, and that isn't enough to sterilize the malt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not put a tray of water in the oven to simulate the effects of a pc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PC'ing jars does NOT force water into the jar.  We use lids with holes and filters on our jars, so the pressure inside the jar is the same as the pressure outside the jars.  One additional thing the steam does besides heat transfer is provide 100% humidity during the sterilization process so that our grains don't dry out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5641718</next>\n<prev>5641386</prev>\n<first>5640554</first>\n<last>5649231</last>\n<when>1147886264</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
