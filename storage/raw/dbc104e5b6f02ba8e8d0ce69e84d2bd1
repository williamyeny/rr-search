You want petri dishes that are about the diameter of your beer can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the plastic, presterilized dishes.  They're in a sleeve of 20.  Don't open the sleeve until you're ready to pour the agar, and open it inside the glovebox.  After pouring, put the sleeve back over the stacked dishes.  It will help reduce condensation and will protect the unsealed dishes from contaminants as they cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let your agar cool 'almost' to room temperature before pouring. I estimate my agar is about 100F to 110F when I pour. You should need no protection from the heat of the bottle for your pouring hand. This will cut down drastically on condensation on the lids. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's cheapest to buy a box of 500 dishes at a time.  It's amazing how fast you go through them once you get to isolating strains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6610283</next>\n<prev>6609875</prev>\n<first>6609009</first>\n<last>6611293</last>\n<when>1172455341</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 04:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
