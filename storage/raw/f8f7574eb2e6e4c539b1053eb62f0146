Don't use masking tape.  You want gas exchange during colonization, but it doesn't have to be much.  The four inoculation holes are your gas exchange holes and the dry vermiculite is your filter.  Keep your jars at room temperature until one week past full colonization, and then birth, dunk and roll.  You have three weeks to go until then.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7043143</next>\n<prev>7043024</prev>\n<first>7041339</first>\n<last>7043143</last>\n<when>1181779760</when>\n<utime>06/14/07 03:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
