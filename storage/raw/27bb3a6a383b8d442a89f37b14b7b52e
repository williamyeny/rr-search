It requires a temperature in excess of boiling to effect sterilization.  This is not even a point to argue.  I've seen lots of people over the years try oven sterilization, with a 100% failure rate.  I've never seen one single proponent post a picture of a mushroom grown on grains that were 'sterilized'in the oven.   If you weighed 'jars' and they were the same as before the oven, you didn't even heat them to 100c, and they will contaminate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5649216</prev>\n<first>5640554</first>\n<last>5649231</last>\n<when>1148043388</when>\n<utime>05/19/06 03:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
