Once all the competition is gone, up go the prices.  Now you have high prices, no jobs, no health insurance, and no competition.  Boycott walmart please.  Don't steal, because stealing is wrong.  Just boycott.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5537899</next>\n<prev>5537884</prev>\n<first>5536916</first>\n<last>26470140</last>\n<when>1145563688</when>\n<utime>04/20/06 11:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
