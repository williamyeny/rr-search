{"key":"post-6114281","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6114281</id>\n<content>It's much easier with a medical scalpel with a razor sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to wash the scalpel with alcohol, then flame sterilize.  Use the cool agar on the receiving dish to cool the scalpel just before the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want the petri dishes open the least amount of time possible.  I follow the 5 second rule.  Never allow a petri dish or jar lid to be open for more than five seconds at any time.  Never have more than one petri dish open at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6114313</next>\n<prev>6114230</prev>\n<first>6114230</first>\n<last>6114313</last>\n<when>1159526632</when>\n<utime>09/29/06 01:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
