Many of us have seen up to a 20 degree increase. This is not something to rant about-it's fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You seem to just want to argue over childish nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Please take it to OTD if that's the case.&amp;nbsp; I will be courteous only so long.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11874784</next>\n<prev>11874661</prev>\n<first>11868597</first>\n<last>12280977</last>\n<when>1264125692</when>\n<utime>01/22/10 04:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
