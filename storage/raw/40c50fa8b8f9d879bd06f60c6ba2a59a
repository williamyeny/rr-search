It is not &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt;, which is a totally different species.  With all the re-naming of strains, someone named a cube strain 'a strain' and people have been confused ever since.  You have cubes, and not too healthy either.  They look like they're starving for water, air AND light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;P mexicana&lt;/i&gt; is a sclerotia producing species and my personal favorite.  They do great on rye berries or rye grass seed.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8466397</next>\n<prev>8465393</prev>\n<first>8462569</first>\n<last>8466397</last>\n<when>1212214004</when>\n<utime>05/31/08 09:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
