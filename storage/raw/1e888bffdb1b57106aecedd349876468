A picture will help, but just keep an eye on it.  In addition, you can swipe at it with a q-tip.  If the cotton turns green, it's mold, otherwise bruising.  Mold spores are on the surface as another layer, as if you sprinkled green sand on the cake.  Bruising will simply be the color of the mycelium.  Hopefully this helps you identify it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6689969</next>\n<prev>6689392</prev>\n<first>6689154</first>\n<last>6689969</last>\n<when>1174365108</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 07:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
