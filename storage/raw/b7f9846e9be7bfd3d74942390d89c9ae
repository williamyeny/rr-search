They'll be triple the price you can get them for online however.  Wrapping dishes in parafilm is perfect for keep out contaminants and allowing for gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after germination, you'll notice divergent lines of mycelium.  Each of these sectors is a 'strain'.  Carefully transfer each to new dishes, and if they sector further, transfer again until you have monocultures of non-sectoring mycelium.  It usually takes three transfers for me to get isolated strains, by transferring pieces no larger than a grain of rice.  I like the three and four section petri dishes shown below for this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruit out each and every strain to find the best performer.  One or two of them will usually be far above and beyond average.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-33/605067105-dish_family.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-33/605067105-thumb_dish_family.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6004414</prev>\n<first>6003870</first>\n<last>6005001</last>\n<when>1156800692</when>\n<utime>08/29/06 12:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
