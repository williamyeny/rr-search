Look for 'natural daylight' tubes or whatever they call them in your country.  They should have a color temperature of 6,000 Kelvin to 7,000 Kelvin for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use coolmists and have never used an ultrasonic.  They're overkill in my opinion, since a coolmist will move air and humidify a small greenhouse very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be glad you don't have wal mart.  They destroy jobs and wages, as well as small business wherever they go.  I've boycotted them for ten years.  I won't step foot in one of their stores.  In fact, we won't even allow them to build one in my city.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6776592</next>\n<prev>6776552</prev>\n<first>6776361</first>\n<last>6778048</last>\n<when>1176339653</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
