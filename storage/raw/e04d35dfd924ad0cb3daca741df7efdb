Mycelium is not spent because it ran out of food.  It is spent because it's old and tired.  Add more food and you feed the fresh contaminat spores that are on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the only contaminated part of the cake is the exterior. Sterilize that, and it seems to me you've got a good sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;  Sterilization requires boiling or pressure cooking, which would kill the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6620683</next>\n<prev>6620397</prev>\n<first>6620211</first>\n<last>24839672</last>\n<when>1172694120</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 10:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
