{"key":"post-5703541","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5703541</id>\n<content>A few years ago, I ran several experiments to prove/disprove stamets' theory that if you clone very young healthy pins, the hormones that stimulate pinning are active, therefore the mycelium that grows from those pins will in turn produce better flushes with abundunt primordia and fewer aborts.  The tests were inconclusive, but in producing my mushroom instructional DVD, I've started up many of the old experiments in order to demonstrate them on the DVD.  Here's a sneak peak.  These pins were snipped off a healthy casing layer that was supporting a massive pinset.  In a glovebox, flame sterilized tweezers were used to hold the pins, while a flame sterilized scalpel was used to cut them off just above the casing layer.  Anybody want to give odds on if cloning this way will work?  I keep hearing that pins will rot.  Whatcha folks think?&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597204-Cloning_pins_1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597204-thumb_Cloning_pins_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5703567</next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>5703541</first>\n<last>5708903</last>\n<when>1149266037</when>\n<utime>06/02/06 07:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
