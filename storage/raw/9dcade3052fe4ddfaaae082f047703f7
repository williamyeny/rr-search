I'm no fan of stuffing polyfil in the vent holes, because it can slow down air exchange, leading to more vegetative growth instead of fruiting.  There is no reason to try to keep a fruiting chamber sterile.  Massive air exchanges will stimulate pinning and decrease the chances for molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5681191</next>\n<prev>5681118</prev>\n<first>5681118</first>\n<last>5681214</last>\n<when>1148774716</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 03:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
