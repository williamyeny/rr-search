A 1&quot; layer works well.  Cover with aluminum foil and set on a shelf for three days or so until the mycelium has knitted itself back together.  Add 1/2&quot; layer of pasteurized casing material and cover again with foil.  Let that sit for a week or so until the casing layer is 2/3 or so colonized.  Remove the foil and expose to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5207680</next>\n<prev>5207642</prev>\n<first>5207613</first>\n<last>5208594</last>\n<when>1137897630</when>\n<utime>01/22/06 04:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
