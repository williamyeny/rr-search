I cover cased bulk substrates during the spawn run and also during the casing run to block light until after full colonization, so all pinning triggers can be applied at once.  These techniques we've developed are why cultivated mushrooms yield much more per square foot of surface area than wild mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where paul changed his mind is in keeping spawn jars in total darkness.  He has 10,000 square feet of incubation space with mycelium from dozens or more species colonizing under 12 hours per day of industrial fluorescent lighting with no ill effects.  I've been incubating jars in normal room lighting for years with no ill effets. The only time they pin early is if something else is wrong, which triggers the natural survival mechanism to reproduce.  I think we're on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5834491</next>\n<prev>5834452</prev>\n<first>5834134</first>\n<last>5834491</last>\n<when>1152368423</when>\n<utime>07/08/06 05:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
