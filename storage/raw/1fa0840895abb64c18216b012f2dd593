Air exchange is the key to preventing contaminants in a fruiting chamber, not filtering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You folks will laugh your butts off if I post a picture of where my terrariums are sitting.  Our condo is a 'sick house' with black mold on the walls and studs and joists behind the sheetrock. It's bad for our health, but we can't get rid of it without tearing the building down.  We're going to sell it and move out asap.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my terrariums are sitting within 18&quot; of a nasty growth of black mold on a wall around the window.  I have never had it transfer to the terrariums.  People worry entirely too much about 'sterility' in fruiting chambers, when 'air exchange' is what they should be worried about, even if they exchange moldy air with more moldy air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sterile when preparing spawn, and toss sterility out the window when preparing fruiting chambers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8508707</next>\n<prev>6629359</prev>\n<first>6628051</first>\n<last>8509673</last>\n<when>1172890608</when>\n<utime>03/03/07 04:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
