At full colonization, soak it underwater for six hours, then drain well and place into fruiting conditions.  Cover with a sheet of wax paper to hold a high humidity right against the substrate to stimulate primordia formation. Replace the sheet of wax paper every two days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6883201</next>\n<prev>6882665</prev>\n<first>6882397</first>\n<last>6883273</last>\n<when>1178514675</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 08:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
