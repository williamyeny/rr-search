Drill holes on all six sides if you do that.  If you're going to put the straw directly in the tub, don't drill holes in the bottom or it will stimulate pinning on the underside of the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8069356</next>\n<prev>8069207</prev>\n<first>8069207</first>\n<last>8069805</last>\n<when>1203984849</when>\n<utime>02/26/08 02:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
