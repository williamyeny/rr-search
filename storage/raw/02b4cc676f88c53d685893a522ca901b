I could not even see through the windows. Now that the air in the kitchen has had time to even out through the house, most of that moisture is gone form my window I can see out of it now, not all of it bust most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humidity in my house dropped so now the air in my house can hold more moisture so some of the moisture was absorbed from the window back into my air. Its only getting colder outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how rain works rite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air can hold 99% once it hits 100% you start to get condensation rite in the air and it rains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why you are more likely to get rain at night. It cools the air and now the air can not hold as much moisture so it has no were to go but into heavy droplets that fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry dude, but I tried really hard to find one single accurate statement in all that and was unable to do so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17825275</next>\n<prev>17823572</prev>\n<first>17736027</first>\n<last>28126722</last>\n<when>1361200140</when>\n<utime>02/18/13 05:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
