Inside the fruiting room i just see well some plants because i create a more natural enviroment....and for sure they will help to keep high humidity... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were going to work with nature, not against it you wouldn't sterilize your substrates.&amp;nbsp; Plants don't want or tolerate near-saturation humidity, because transpiration stops.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms want a higher humidity than plants and they don't want the plant's cooties.&amp;nbsp; Any oxygen released by the plant will be insufficient for the needs of the mycelium, and any CO2 released by the mushrooms will be unused by the plant which will have growth stunted in the high humidity environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people have put plants and mushrooms together, usually with abysmal results.&amp;nbsp; The search engine is your friend.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>25854684</next>\n<prev>25853905</prev>\n<first>25853756</first>\n<last>25857823</last>\n<when>1551829511</when>\n<utime>03/06/19 01:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
