I'll just go out, start another 1 month project, spend a bunch more money, and make sure I post every single little frickin thing and continually try to suck all your balls... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is only one quote out of several that say you need to chill the fuck out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're free to disagree with me.&amp;nbsp; No law or rule says you have to agree with everything/anything I say here.&amp;nbsp; You made a blanket statement above about substrate affecting potency that you couldn't back up, and my own experiments showed the claim to be incorrect.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore the idea of quinoa or amaranth increasing potency is based their tryptophan content, an assertion that has never been proved, yet has been disproved many times.&amp;nbsp; You're parroting subjective posts that others have tried to duplicate and were unable to.&amp;nbsp; I've ran tests on fruits from identical isolated strains grown on a plethora of substrates, using a GC, and found nothing but normal potency variations.&amp;nbsp; In fact, some of the fruits grown on grains(actually seeds) you're ranting about being so great for potency tested at a lower potency, but within the range of variation that's common, thus I'd never say that quinoa or millet &lt;i&gt;lowers&lt;/i&gt; potency, but in none of my controlled tests did it ever raise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had been ranting at anyone else but me in this manner, I'd have given you a few days off already.&amp;nbsp; The fact that I haven't shows I'm willing to bend over backwards to allow dissenting opinion.&amp;nbsp; However, any more flaming of anyone in this thread and you'll be history.&amp;nbsp; You started this thread to spam and got nuked by another mod.&amp;nbsp; You've also broken the rules and had moderator action in another forum, so don't push your luck.&amp;nbsp; Take a chill pill, do some grows, document your findings, and post them.&amp;nbsp; You had somebody disagree with you and then you went apeshit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/hissyfit.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:hissyfit:&quot; title=&quot;:hissyfit:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such will not be tolerated, so consider yourself warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, take a look in advanced mycology.&amp;nbsp; There's ten years worth of threads on 'increasing potency' by this or that substrate or additive.&amp;nbsp; I believe it's simply genetic variation, since invariably they were all using multispore inoculation.&amp;nbsp; Others disagree.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10361173</next>\n<prev>10361077</prev>\n<first>10283219</first>\n<last>16097740</last>\n<when>1242700853</when>\n<utime>05/19/09 05:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
