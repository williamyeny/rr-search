Now, whether YOU'LL be fine after eating fungicides remains to be seen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer sterile technique for grains and proper pasteurization of substrates along with plenty of fresh air exchange, and molds will be rare indeed. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8309117</next>\n<prev>8308361</prev>\n<first>8307125</first>\n<last>8315265</last>\n<when>1208733913</when>\n<utime>04/21/08 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
