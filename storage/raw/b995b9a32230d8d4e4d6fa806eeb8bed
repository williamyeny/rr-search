A still air environment is what you want, and yours would take care of that fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A puddle on the tyvek in a grain jar is an almost guarantee of contamination.  Under the foil, the condensation would be coming from the grains.  A wet filter with nutes is a perfect path for contaminants to colonize right through the interior of the filter and into your grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second mistake was using the knife to scoop out your grains.  Alcohol is not a sterilizer.  You need to break up the grains by banging the jar agaist a fully inflated tire half a dozen times.  Each kernel will separate from each other kernel that way, allowing you to pour from one jar to the other without ever touching the grains with a foreign object.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5689805</next>\n<prev>5689661</prev>\n<first>5689455</first>\n<last>5691164</last>\n<when>1148989839</when>\n<utime>05/30/06 02:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
