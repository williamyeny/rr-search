If you want your humidifier to help provide fresh air exchange, cut a hole in your greenhouse big enough for the output half of the humidifier to be inside the greenhouse and the intake half to be on the outside.  Now you get FAE with no 'static pressure' which is a better word.  It doesn't really overwork the motor because the impeller blade simply cavitates and doesn't push the air, but it does cause the motor bushings to get wet, which ruins them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my humidifiers inside the greenhouse on each side of the shelves so they can shoot their mist upward from the floor of the greenhouse all the way to the top.  This humidifies the entire greenhouse to a much higher humidity because you're recycling the same moist air through the humidifier rather than sucking in dry air from outside.   Simply cut holes in the side of the greenhouse for air exchange, or leave the door partly open.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6708904</next>\n<prev>6708820</prev>\n<first>6708768</first>\n<last>6708978</last>\n<when>1174832654</when>\n<utime>03/25/07 05:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
