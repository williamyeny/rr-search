You probably got a bit more solution into the second jar.   Put them both up for a week, then look again. Don't let them get too hot.  Anything over 75F is ok, but try not to go over 81f at any time.  Mycelium growth slows down dramatically at 84F and above and it's always warmer inside the jars than outside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6607193</next>\n<prev>6606734</prev>\n<first>6606396</first>\n<last>6608611</last>\n<when>1172376888</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 06:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
