It's best to put them outdoors where they might fruit again, but the chances are against you trying to do it indoors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, your cakes have been exposed to millions of contaminant spores during their time and they've fought off the invaders.  However, now with fresh substrate, those same mold spores will be encouraged to grow. These projects fail more often than they succeed, dumping green spores all over the grow area.  That's the only reason I recommend against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better plan is to have fresh jars colonized just as the previous project is running out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6390448</next>\n<prev>6390412</prev>\n<first>6390364</first>\n<last>6390696</last>\n<when>1166648314</when>\n<utime>12/20/06 10:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
