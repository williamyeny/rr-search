The holes on the bottom would simply drain any water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, perlite is a crystalline substance.&amp;nbsp; It works by having a huge surface area relative to its mass.&amp;nbsp; This large surface holds water, while providing the surface &lt;i&gt;area&lt;/i&gt; to evaporate this water into the air, providing humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, due to the fact that perlite is crystalline, it's physically impossible for it to 'wick up' water from anywhere.&amp;nbsp; That would require an absorbent, and perlite by the nature of its structure isn't absorbent.&amp;nbsp; Having a dry perlite layer on top would only 'seal' the moist perlite below, lowering humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, fresh air exchange is the number ONE pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; It wouldn't matter squat if you had 100% humidity because without fresh air circulation, your projects would mold and either not pin at all or pin poorly.&amp;nbsp; The reduction in CO2 levels is the major pinning trigger along with bright light as the main secondary pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the shotgun terrarium produces maximum humidity while giving automated fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; When you mist your substrates, the overspray re-moistens the perlite, thus keeping the system working throughout the growing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12762871</next>\n<prev>12762390</prev>\n<first>12761701</first>\n<last>12763020</last>\n<when>1276872291</when>\n<utime>06/18/10 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
