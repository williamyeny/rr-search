Keep it in the incubator(seal it off so any others you have don't get contaminated). Simply let the mycelium completely grow. Then let the mushrooms growing. I know this sounds crazy, but after you've harvested the mushrooms, dry them out as usual, as use the &quot;Crystals of the God tek to extract the psilocybin from the mushrooms. It should work okay, even if their contaminated, seeing how many, if all, toxins and poisons break down in the alcohol, and virtually none are accumulative in high-proof alcohol. heres da link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fanaticus.com/mycoalki.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.fanaticus.com/mycoalk&lt;wbr&gt;i.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is one of the most horrible pieces of advice I've ever read here.  You don't have a clue.  In addition, mushrooms won't grow in a sealed incubator.  Get some experience under your belt before you begin to contradict those who have been down this road hundreds, if not thousands of times before you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, you also don't have any idea what will be extracted into the alcohol.  It can concentrate and extract any toxin present.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6822884</next>\n<prev>6822608</prev>\n<first>6819635</first>\n<last>6839465</last>\n<when>1177346267</when>\n<utime>04/23/07 07:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
