I went through well over 200 petri dishes of mycelium for no other reason than to determine the temperature that stimulates fastest growth, other factors being equal. That was a far more controlled study than the one reported over 20 years ago. If someone else wants to repeat the experiment, go for it.  I consider the matter closed.  Paul doesn't even repeat that 86F figure, which someone else sent him.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7868526</next>\n<prev>7868389</prev>\n<first>7864335</first>\n<last>15963874</last>\n<when>1200155202</when>\n<utime>01/12/08 06:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
