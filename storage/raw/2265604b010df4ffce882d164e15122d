I don't like them any better than cubes for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take exception to azures being the most potent.  After 30 years of picking, I consider psilocybe cyanescens on average to be much better than azures.  They're a cleaner trip without the paralysis that can occur with azures.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6143131</next>\n<prev>6142993</prev>\n<first>6140362</first>\n<last>6145577</last>\n<when>1160239500</when>\n<utime>10/07/06 07:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
