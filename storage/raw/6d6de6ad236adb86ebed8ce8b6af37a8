Manure should be left loose and fluffy. I doubt it will be able to colonize like that, and there's a good chance it will go south due to contamination in the center where no air can reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest getting a room as clean as you can, then spray with oust or ten percent bleach to further clean the air.  Use latex gloves or a clean spoon and stir the entire contents to mix and fluff it up.  It wouldn't hurt at all to have a bit of moistened vermiculite to mix in as well, but the important thing is to get the substrate loose and aerated so the mycelium can penetrate.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5815174</next>\n<prev>5815079</prev>\n<first>5814992</first>\n<last>5815944</last>\n<when>1151939062</when>\n<utime>07/03/06 06:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
