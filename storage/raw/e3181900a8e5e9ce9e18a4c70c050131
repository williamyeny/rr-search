They grow well in East and South Texas, but are just migrating to west.  I heard a report of them being found in Abilene recently, so if true it's the farthest west I've seen them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put sporeprints into the cattle water trough to get them started.  An alternative is to grow out some pf jars at home, then bury them in the field you want to start.  When the mushrooms appear, leave them to nature.  Don't pick them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6398517</next>\n<prev>6397981</prev>\n<first>6397291</first>\n<last>6398517</last>\n<when>1166849509</when>\n<utime>12/23/06 06:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
