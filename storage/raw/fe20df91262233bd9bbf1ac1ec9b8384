For small quantities, I use the pc, but don't put the weight on the lid, so no pressure is allowed to build.  Just load your jars, put them in the pc, and let them steam without pressure for 30 minutes.  Shut off the heat, and when cool they're ready to use.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2214636</next>\n<prev>2214424</prev>\n<first>2214424</first>\n<last>2215289</last>\n<when>1073045838</when>\n<utime>01/02/04 02:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
