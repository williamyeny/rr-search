With those odds I will lose approx. 1.2 jars per dozen, not too bad&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. However, a ten percent loss is absolutely horrible, and failing to take precautions will actually lead to a much higher failure rate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also says, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Sterilization is a very important part of mushroom cultivation, but not as important as most people think. What I mean by that is the fact that there are billions of foreign contaminate spores floating around in the air where you are now. If some of these spores get into your culture jars they can easily kill your young plants.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot; title=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Sterilization is extremely important, as is sterile procedure, and we're growing fungi here, not plants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt;, if you'll follow the procedure, especially the sterile procedure to the letter, you'll get 99% or better success.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11875645</next>\n<prev>11873752</prev>\n<first>11867860</first>\n<last>11875645</last>\n<when>1264118277</when>\n<utime>01/22/10 01:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
