{"key":"post-6664842","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6664842</id>\n<content>I pc the water in a jar with a lid, but just boil the syringes for half an hour before use.  I then take the pot of boiling water/syringes into the sterile environment, remove the syringes, flame the needles and use.  I see no reason to PC syringes.  It certainly doesn't hurt, but in my experience, not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6664459</prev>\n<first>6663925</first>\n<last>6664842</last>\n<when>1173815371</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 10:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
