It would be best to sterilize your tools/containers in boiling water.  Lysol is a surface disinfectant, not a sterilizer, and it leaves behind a film that can kill your mushroom spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, distilled water out of the bottle is not sterile.  It should also be boiled, or as most do, put it in a filtered jar and PC it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your next try, I'd boil the syringes, even if they just came out of the package, then flame sterilize the needles just before use. Boil or PC any water you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build a small glovebox to use when removing the tape from the jars. Don't use your syringe to puncture the tape.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6046327</next>\n<prev>6045926</prev>\n<first>6045246</first>\n<last>6050930</last>\n<when>1157889984</when>\n<utime>09/10/06 03:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
