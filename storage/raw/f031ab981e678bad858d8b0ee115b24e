Because of torrents, there's no incentive for anyone to go to all that time and expense, just to have their work &lt;del&gt;shared&lt;/del&gt; stolen. That's why the spread of new, updated information has come to a screeching halt.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14600367</next>\n<prev>14600136</prev>\n<first>14597841</first>\n<last>14600492</last>\n<when>1307895887</when>\n<utime>06/12/11 07:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
