If it did, I wouldn't get 999 out of 1000 substrates making it through harvest with no mold, because I use coffee in every single one of them. Improper technique causes contamination.&amp;nbsp; For those who consider 'pasteurization' to be dumping boiling water into a bucket, they would be advised to stay away from good substrates, and substrate additives such as coffee, and just be satisfied with mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while mold spores don't germinate on coir, they certainly do on vermiculite.&amp;nbsp; Even if one leaves out the coffee and the boost it provides, they'll still get mold growing in the vermiculite if they fail to follow proper procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no substitute for the benefits to mushroom production from coffee.&amp;nbsp; I doubt seriously it's the 'nutes' because there's lots of different nitrogen sources, etc., but they don't pack the punch of coffee.&amp;nbsp; It must be one of the other 200 or so compounds in coffee, or the combination of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14580091</next>\n<prev>14579783</prev>\n<first>14578814</first>\n<last>14728616</last>\n<when>1307563437</when>\n<utime>06/08/11 11:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
