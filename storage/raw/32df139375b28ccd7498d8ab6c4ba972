After a week, soak it for six to twelve hours under water to re-hydrate.  We refer to this as 'dunking'.  After the soak, place it back into fruiting conditions, and the second flush usually pops fairly quick, provided the substrate has no contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6854254</next>\n<prev>6854183</prev>\n<first>6854164</first>\n<last>6854381</last>\n<when>1177965912</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 11:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
