It won't help with any other molds.  Mushroom mycelium hates peroxide almost as much as mold mycelium hates it, so use only when you must.  To kill an outbreak of cobweb mold, spray it full strength from the bottle, if you bought it in the US.  If you live elsewhere, adjust with distilled water as necessary to get 3 percent peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7201398</prev>\n<first>7201398</first>\n<last>7209855</last>\n<when>1185126813</when>\n<utime>07/22/07 08:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
