People like to post their killer flushes with wall to wall fruits, but those are the exception, not something you should hold yourself to until you learn strain isolation.   Once you get a great fruiting strain isolated, you can save it in master culture slants to use from now on.  As long as you're using spores to grow, your flush is what to expect.  That's nothing to be ashamed of by the way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7085399</next>\n<prev>7085377</prev>\n<first>7085264</first>\n<last>7085399</last>\n<when>1182663686</when>\n<utime>06/24/07 08:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
