I don't care if the lid is the same as a regular quart jar lid it has a wide mouth in comparison to the rest of the jar.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the wrong type of jar, and whether the lid is wider than the rest of the jar is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; We use the short, squat wide-mouth half pints because they're wider than they are tall, so the substrate doesn't pack and/or get oxygen starved at the bottom.&amp;nbsp; The tall, skinny half pints are vastly inferior, based on tens of thousands of independent grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14837571</next>\n<prev>14837515</prev>\n<first>14821310</first>\n<last>14837809</last>\n<when>1311860673</when>\n<utime>07/28/11 04:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
