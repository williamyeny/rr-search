I see what appears to be bruising on fully colnonized substrate because it's blue.  If it turns the q-tip green, you'll know, but i doubt it will.   Trichoderma won't be the color of the substrate or casing, it will be a layer above it, as if you poured some green sand out on the top of the casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6615076</next>\n<prev>6614995</prev>\n<first>6614380</first>\n<last>6625298</last>\n<when>1172557509</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 08:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
