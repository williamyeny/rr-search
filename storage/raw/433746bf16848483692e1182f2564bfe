I suppose I could just use 1/2 pints for that though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not how it's done.&amp;nbsp; Pouring a petri and then sterilizing is a great way for all your agar to boil over and spill into the PC.&amp;nbsp; This is why we sterilize a bottle of agar and then pour in sterile conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using jars is a further waste of money and materials.&amp;nbsp; I can only imagine the financial expense, mess, and shelf space requirements if I had several hundred 1/2 pint jars stacked up rather than petri dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 15 cents each, just use petri dishes.&amp;nbsp; After use, find a kid to give them to for keeping their bugs and other treasures.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16699026</next>\n<prev>16698390</prev>\n<first>16695183</first>\n<last>20638892</last>\n<when>1344964793</when>\n<utime>08/14/12 08:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
