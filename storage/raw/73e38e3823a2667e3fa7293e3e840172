Maybe sulfur causes those sorts of issues. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/strokebeard.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:strokebeard:&quot; title=&quot;:strokebeard:&quot;/&gt; peculiar. I know someone talked about sulfur and its effects in the advanced section way back. Though its context is beyond me at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My well water has hydrogen-sulfide gas which gives it a rotten egg smell.&amp;nbsp; It's caused by a sulfur bacteria that feeds on iron in the water, and it causes the pH to swing way high.&amp;nbsp; I bleach the well out with several gallons of laundry bleach twice per year when it gets to stinking.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday, I checked the pH of my well water and it was 9.&amp;nbsp; Today, after shock-chlorinating(google it) the well, followed by flushing, it's back to pH 6.5 which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the US/Canada/Europe and many other 'civilized' areas, tap water is fine to use for everything except long term spore storage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard water tends to cause spores to germinate if they're stored in liquid.&amp;nbsp; Water from a softener has a lot of salt in it and that could cause problems. Spring or pond/lake/river water is great, but should be filtered before use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12938951</next>\n<prev>12938494</prev>\n<first>12937629</first>\n<last>12939066</last>\n<when>1279864743</when>\n<utime>07/23/10 08:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
