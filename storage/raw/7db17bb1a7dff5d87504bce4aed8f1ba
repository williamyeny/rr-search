It will be useless to spray the air with lysol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no need to maintain sterility in a growing environment.  Massive air exchange while maintaining humidity will prevent contaminants such as trich and cobweb which thrive in still, stale air.  I used to run HEPA filters, but I've sent them all to the storage bin, as they seemed to make no difference whatsoever.  Air exchange and circulation will prevent contaminants from a growing area.   Only the area you spawn in must be kept sterile.  a glovebox or flow hood is mandatory.  After that, air exchange is the key.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4504233</next>\n<prev>4503608</prev>\n<first>4503548</first>\n<last>4507923</last>\n<when>1123350032</when>\n<utime>08/06/05 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
