You seem to be fine though.  If your humidity is too low, you'll have cracked caps, which you don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd think about getting that wood out of your terrarium design asap though.  It will grow green molds very fast in the high humidity environment of a fruiting chamber.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6075351</next>\n<prev>6074742</prev>\n<first>6074742</first>\n<last>6077542</last>\n<when>1158624305</when>\n<utime>09/19/06 03:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
