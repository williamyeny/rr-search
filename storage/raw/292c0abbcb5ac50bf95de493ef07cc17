If you run hoses, send them to opposing sides and shelves to help circulate the air within and prevent humidity stratification which can easily occur within a greenhouse.  It will help to get a hygrometer for each shelf so you can monitor the situation as you work out your system.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5995127</prev>\n<first>5994090</first>\n<last>5995488</last>\n<when>1156521852</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
