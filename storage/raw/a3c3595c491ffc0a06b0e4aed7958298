Just remember after misting to up the air exchange so the pins don't sit there wet for any length of time.  It takes a grow or two and then you'll develop the ability to look at the casing layer and know when it needs moisture.  Nobody gets it 'perfect' the first few times, but it sounds like you're getting it.
