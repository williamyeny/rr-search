I sleep with a window open, even during winter.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it was 10F here on Easter Sunday morning. Simply put the terrarium near a sunny window and it will heat up during the daytime that way.&amp;nbsp; Alternatively, even a 6500K CFL puts out some heat.&amp;nbsp; Make sure it's close enough to the terrarium to provide heating during the 12 hours it's on. 60F at night is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humidity is provided by air filtering up through the perlite.&amp;nbsp; The perlite is constantly refreshed by the overspray when you mist your cakes, so you don't need to do anything extra.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16064057</next>\n<prev>16064007</prev>\n<first>16063818</first>\n<last>16064185</last>\n<when>1333966313</when>\n<utime>04/09/12 01:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
