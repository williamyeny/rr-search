You still have fifteen psi above atmospheric.  A guage is only accurate in the top 2/3 or so of its scale.  For accuracy, you need to find a guage that will read 25 to 30 psi at full scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to add some time to your cooking though.  I'd give jars 2 hours at your altitude.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4985876</next>\n<prev>4985320</prev>\n<first>4984923</first>\n<last>4992286</last>\n<when>1133100866</when>\n<utime>11/27/05 04:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
