The biggest reason for small mushrooms is running out of water.  If they're flushing now, just use a syringe to inject a few cc's into several places in the substrate.  Tap water usually works fine, and there's no need to sterilize the syringe first as long as it's been washed clean.  Don't drown the substrate, just a bit here and there and it should work wonders.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time, you will develop a feel for how heavy a tray should be, so you can lift your trays and tell if they need water or not.  When they start to dry out, they get very light.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5842953</next>\n<prev>5842820</prev>\n<first>5842786</first>\n<last>5843190</last>\n<when>1152566572</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 12:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
