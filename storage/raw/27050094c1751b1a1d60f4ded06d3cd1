Take the filter type cool mist you have and simply run it in the room the greenhouse is in to sort of pre-humidify the air and make it easier to maintain in the greenhouse.  As HC said, you need a spinning impeller type cool mist.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boycott walmart please.  Once they put the competition out of business in an area, they jack up the prices and cut the employees pay because they have nowhere else to work.  They suck.  Let's all work together to put walmart out of buisness for the good of the country/world.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5653089</next>\n<prev>5653065</prev>\n<first>5652978</first>\n<last>5653124</last>\n<when>1148147406</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 08:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
