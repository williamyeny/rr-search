I boiled the water first, filled the bottles to 100ml. Added 4ml honey and pc'd for 90mins at 10psi. There is alot of floaties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't buy into the hype noobs attempt to spread to other noobs.&amp;nbsp; LC is much slower than inoculation with spores directly into your cakes and you lose another unnecessary vector of contamination.&amp;nbsp; You don't find experienced growers using LC, and I know of zero commercial mushroom farms which use them.&amp;nbsp; In addition, honey is anti-fungal, making it an even worse choice than other lame methods of making liquid culture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13550863</next>\n<prev>13547121</prev>\n<first>13546010</first>\n<last>13556953</last>\n<when>1290879918</when>\n<utime>11/27/10 07:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
