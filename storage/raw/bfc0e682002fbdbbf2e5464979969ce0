The more water on top of them = more pressure = more water getting absorbed. That's just how I do it. Always made since to me... I never let them float or be out of the water or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do.&amp;nbsp; The extra pressure hydrates the cakes faster.&amp;nbsp; You can tell from the weight when they're finished.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to rinse the cakes under the faucet after removing from the soak water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19688432</next>\n<prev>19687934</prev>\n<first>19679142</first>\n<last>19695754</last>\n<when>1394680218</when>\n<utime>03/13/14 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
