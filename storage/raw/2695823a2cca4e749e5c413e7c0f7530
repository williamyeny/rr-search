On my first grow I waited and waited and contam with green mold. This time I did not wait around as long to see it. But, yeah definitely, they were on the way to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as far as the colonization goes the jars were covered in the dark for weeks (slow colonization too like 7 weeks). The jars were also set in a constant 80 degree environment, as well. &lt;br /&gt;So, at this point I think I might leave BRF cakes and go grain. I must be doing something wrong somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn't get anything about 80 degrees or colonization in the dark from my videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, grains are far more susceptible to contamination than brf cakes, so I wouldn't be so fast to move on.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15376811</next>\n<prev>15354544</prev>\n<first>15352877</first>\n<last>15376897</last>\n<when>1321028347</when>\n<utime>11/11/11 06:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
