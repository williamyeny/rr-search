So I busted a cap in his ass &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it you'd rather have rats, mice, and skunks shitting and pissing in your hay? &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need sterile snake venom if you're going to use it with agar.&amp;nbsp; It's heat sensitive and ruined by autoclaving, so it has to be added as the agar cools below 100F.&amp;nbsp; It's milked under sterile conditions in front of a laminar flow hood, and then freeze dried to a powder, and must be stored at -20C or below until use.&amp;nbsp;  It's also about $400 to $500 per gram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most strains will readily cross without using venom.&amp;nbsp; It will help with non-compatible strains, and it's also been used to successfully cross different species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to cross two strains(I'm using 'strain' in the sense it's usually used here, that is naming a print and calling it a strain), simply print one cap right on top of the print left by another cap.&amp;nbsp;  By then using the resultant print, it would be nearly impossible to not get several crosses.&amp;nbsp; You'd want to do it on agar and isolate the strains as they differentiate, carefully labeling each one.&amp;nbsp; when you fruit them, you'll be able to tell which is a cross or not, provided you used two distinctly different parents.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11796192</next>\n<prev>11796171</prev>\n<first>11796141</first>\n<last>11798187</last>\n<when>1263068774</when>\n<utime>01/09/10 10:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
