You're just re-asking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend ever 'incubating' at an ambient temperature above 81F.  Mycelium growth slows down beginning at 83F, and you must realize that the temperature in the jars is a couple of degrees at minimum above ambient.  I use room temperature for colonization.  I strongly disagree that lower temps favor contamination.  The opposite is true.  Higher temperatures favor molds and thermophilic bacteria, which rarely can outgrow mushroom mycelium at a temperature of 75F to 81F.  86F is definitely too high.  Mushroom mycelium has already slowed down and other contaminants are being stimulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggested on the first page you fruit these as cakes, which is the most dependable method, despite lower yields.  Start another crop to learn the more advanced techniques with.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6899834</next>\n<prev>6899327</prev>\n<first>6895583</first>\n<last>6903710</last>\n<when>1178854137</when>\n<utime>05/11/07 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
