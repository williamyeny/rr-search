I only mention it because alcohol won't stimulate trich, and bleach is not effective against it or any other fungi.  In fact, I often dip wild mushrooms, and dry mushroom tissue into a ten percent bleach solution before cloning, to kill off bacteria.  The fungi survives just fine, but it kicks the bacteria out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6669058</next>\n<prev>6668033</prev>\n<first>6667397</first>\n<last>6669058</last>\n<when>1173891643</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 08:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
