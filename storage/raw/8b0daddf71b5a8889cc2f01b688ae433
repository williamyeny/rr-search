Typical liberal spin to make people think its better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back off big boy.  I'm a fucking liberal and I know how to do the math.  Ethanol is a boondogle.  It isn't liberals who are pushing it, but dubya fucking bush.  Don't blame the liberals for the handouts bush is making to farmers to get  john mc cain elected.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8318387</next>\n<prev>8318348</prev>\n<first>8317723</first>\n<last>8337231</last>\n<when>1208971872</when>\n<utime>04/23/08 08:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
