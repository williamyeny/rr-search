I am not just sitting here waiting for everyone to answer my questions for me. I am on the phone, reading books, going to my bank, going to the local investment firm, going to the library, etc. - doing all the footwork while waiting for any information others may post. This is a very important practice called, &quot;leveraging your time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I have sufficiently explained myself...&lt;br /&gt;- Deathbliss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all good, but I answered your question above.&amp;nbsp; I have a commercial mushroom farm in Washington State, and I sell to grocery stores and at farmers markets.&amp;nbsp; I really don't know what more to add.&amp;nbsp; When you have a business in the state, you need a UBI and that's that, because you have to report and pay taxes on income.&amp;nbsp; I don't have the million dollar liability policy, and any stores that demand it don't get my mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; I'm nearly always sold out, so my advice is to hell with paying profit to an insurance company.&amp;nbsp; Don't sell rotten product and it won't be an issue.&amp;nbsp; People don't get e coli from mushrooms grown on sterilized sawdust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is to learn to grow mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; Getting from starting point to where you have a facility with enough production to handle commercial sales is going to take a couple of years at least, which gives plenty of time to learn the paperwork involved.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13943868</next>\n<prev>13943517</prev>\n<first>13925644</first>\n<last>13956097</last>\n<when>1297432040</when>\n<utime>02/11/11 03:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
