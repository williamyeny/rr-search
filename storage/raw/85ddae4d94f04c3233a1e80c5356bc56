{"key":"post-5977950","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5977950</id>\n<content>Right.  I've seen and designed duct mounted humidification systems.  Just not for $20.  What you can get in the $20-$30 price range are the &lt;i&gt;sensors&lt;/i&gt; for the humidity controller.  They still need to be connected to the humidistat itself or a low voltage relay to conrol the 120V humidifier.   The cheapest home heating system humidistat controller I've seen is just over $50, but it operates on 24 volts, so still needs a relay/wiring to use with 120 volts, not to mention the 120/24 control transformer you'll need to make it work, and unless the guy is an electrician or HVAC installer, he'll need help hooking it all up.   I really see no way to beat the $75 price of the line voltage humidistat I posted above.  I have two of them, thus they're tested in our application and it's why I recommend that particular unit.  Bear in mind, it tops out at 80% like all inexpensive models, so it's fine for cased substrates, but if you desire a higher humidity, you'll either need the $300 humidstat(which will also get clogged up with spores) or a timer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5978065</next>\n<prev>5977942</prev>\n<first>5977324</first>\n<last>5978210</last>\n<when>1155997270</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 05:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
