So is this a good option for a high output setup or no? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a noob made a mini-greenhouse and got contamination, it's his fault not the greenhouse.&amp;nbsp; He'd have said the same about any other form of fruiting chamber as well so as not to blame himself for screwing something up.&amp;nbsp; Contamination is caused by faulty technique, not the greenhouse or FC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only purpose of a fruiting environment is to provide an area with high humidity, light, and lots of fresh air.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I don't use Martha's because they're too small.&amp;nbsp; I make my own mini-greenhouses out of PVC tubing and plastic sheeting, so they can go from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall across my available space.&amp;nbsp; Whatever you use, cut lots of holes in it for natural circulation of fresh air, and then either put your humidifier inside the greenhouse or pipe it in with 4&quot; clothes dryer hose so you don't create back pressure that will ruin your humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9893154</next>\n<prev>9892745</prev>\n<first>9892164</first>\n<last>9894112</last>\n<when>1235964837</when>\n<utime>03/02/09 05:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
