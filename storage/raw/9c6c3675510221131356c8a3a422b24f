Bear in mind, that doesn't diminish the others, and a wall-to-wall canopy requires the grower be good at juggling all of them.&amp;nbsp; Remember, none of us ever sees a huge wall-to-wall canopy of fruits in nature, so we're not mimicking nature, we're improving on it to get the best possible results.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We often refer to lowering the CO2 level as a pinning trigger. We also refer to loss of moisture from the substrate as a pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Are they the same thing?&amp;nbsp; When we apply fresh air exchange, the CO2 level naturally lowers, which is a secondary pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Also, when we apply fresh air, the lower humidity of the fresh air causes evaporation, resulting in a loss of moisture from the substrate, a primary pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; One really can't be separated from the other, nor should they be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, while lowering the CO2 is one of many factors involved in pinning, it's not the primary reason for keeping a high CO2 level during colonization.&amp;nbsp; We keep a high CO2 level during colonization because the mycelium seems to consider its job in nature is to break down solid matter, releasing its carbon as CO2.&amp;nbsp; Left unchecked in open air, most of the substrate will have been consumed by the time fruiting happens.&amp;nbsp; We see this in cow fields.&amp;nbsp; The cow patties with mushrooms are noticeably smaller than ones with no mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium has significantly digested most of the manure, liberating it as CO2 into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the mycelium is forced to run through the substrate in a very high CO2 environment, metabolism is slowed, allowing colonization with very little of the final substrate consumed, making it available to support bigger flushes and more of them.&amp;nbsp; This is the reason we keep substrates tightly closed during colonization except for a small amount of gas exchange to prevent the mycelium from suffocating itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fact that air exchange during spawn run will result in faster colonization.&amp;nbsp; However, we don't do it for the reasons explained above.&amp;nbsp; Remember, this reply only considered CO2, not the half dozen or so other factors involved.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14235154</next>\n<prev>14234896</prev>\n<first>14230421</first>\n<last>14262016</last>\n<when>1301926711</when>\n<utime>04/04/11 05:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
