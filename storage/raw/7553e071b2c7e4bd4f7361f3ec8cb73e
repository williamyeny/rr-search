Let them dry out, and the dry straw serves as the contamination barrier.  He poured water down from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do it a bit different by placing in a bag or large tote with holes cut into it for gas exchange.  This keeps the CO2 levels higher during colonization, which actually prevents the mycelium from turning as much of the subsrate carbon into CO2, which reduces the size of the substrate greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week after full colonization, I introduce to the normal fruiting conditions of high humidity and lots of air exchange.  I don't fruit them in open air unless it's the rainy season outdoors, in which case I set them on the back porch to fruit.  You can see a short, low resolution preview video of the way I do it on my website.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7516117</next>\n<prev>7515187</prev>\n<first>7515177</first>\n<last>7516117</last>\n<when>1192380025</when>\n<utime>10/14/07 07:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
