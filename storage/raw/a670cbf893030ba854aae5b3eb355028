I'd wait until you move, but don't crumble them.  Just fruit as cakes.  I've seen no benefit to crumbling pf cakes.  It only damages the mycelium, and then it has to repair itself with no increase in food supply.  Birth, dunk and roll, then fruit.  That's your quickest path to harvest.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6799189</next>\n<prev>6798843</prev>\n<first>6798760</first>\n<last>6799189</last>\n<when>1176825550</when>\n<utime>04/17/07 06:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
