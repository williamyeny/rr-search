After the resting period, soak for a few hours to rehydrate and return to fruiting conditions.  Mycelium needs a week to ten days between flushes, so if you pick a flush, then soak right away, it is drying out again during that resting period.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6569916</prev>\n<first>6569859</first>\n<last>6569975</last>\n<when>1171551302</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
