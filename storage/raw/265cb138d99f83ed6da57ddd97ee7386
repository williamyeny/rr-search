It sounds like you need to order another bag if it is, or get some jars and make your own stuff.  If you do inject water, just boil the syringe in a kettle for fifteen minutes, then suck up some of the boiling water and squirt it right into the bag without waiting for it to cool first.  If you inject through the filter, it's likely to allow contaminants to pass later.  You can stick a blob of rubber silicone on the plastic part of the bag, then the next day when it's set up, you can inject through that.  It will close off when you withdraw the needle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5680361</next>\n<prev>5680161</prev>\n<first>5678829</first>\n<last>5682583</last>\n<when>1148751824</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 08:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
