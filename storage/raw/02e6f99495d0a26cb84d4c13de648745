It's possible it spread it even more, but only time will tell.  Bleach also doesn't kill most fungi, including trichoderma.  Good luck with that grow.  I hope it works out.  The trich sure won't impact your product or harvest, so if your second flush comes quickly, you'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7637109</next>\n<prev>7635889</prev>\n<first>7631835</first>\n<last>7637280</last>\n<when>1195082523</when>\n<utime>11/15/07 01:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
