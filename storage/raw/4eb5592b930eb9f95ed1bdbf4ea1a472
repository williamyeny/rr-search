Perhaps you've heard of those two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I'm holding in my hand has articles from such 'lay persons and hobbyists' as Paul Stamets, Christopher Hobbs, John Holliday, Gaston Guzman, Toshihiro Hashimoto, Soloman Wasser, Gregory Plontnikoff, Daniel Winkler and others too numorous to mention.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel strongly on a board focused on mycology we should concentrate on mycology and not vulgarity, however, feel free to call it whatever you wish.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6652424</next>\n<prev>6652274</prev>\n<first>6649453</first>\n<last>6652581</last>\n<when>1173460843</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
