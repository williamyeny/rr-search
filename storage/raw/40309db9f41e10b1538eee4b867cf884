I suggest inoculating and NOT shaking for at least a week.  By shaking, you spread the spores around, forcing monokaryotic mycelium to hunt for a mate.  If you let the spores germinate right next to each other, they form bonds and become dikaryotic in the first few days after germination, and then grow with the thicker, rhizomorphic mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has a strong resemblance to mold, so keep an eye on it.  Post more pictures in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6903742</next>\n<prev>6903584</prev>\n<first>6903431</first>\n<last>6941905</last>\n<when>1178935422</when>\n<utime>05/12/07 05:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
