Calcium and sulfur are both nutrients used in mushroom fruitbody formation.&amp;nbsp; In addition, gypsum prevents the wild swings in pH we often see as the mushroom mycelium colonizes a substrate. Use it at 5% to 10% by volume to the dry horse manure.&amp;nbsp; Vermiculite can also be added at up to 50% by volume.&amp;nbsp; That isn't a typo.&amp;nbsp; 50%.&amp;nbsp; Vermiculite has not only nutrients fungi love, but also provides a texture and other properties not yet fully understood that increase yields and pinsets.&amp;nbsp; Plant growers will tell you vermiculite has no nutrients(which they're also wrong about), but for fungi, vermiculite provides an excellent supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've said many times, mushrooms will grow better on a complex substrate, meaning a substrate composed of many different ingredients.&amp;nbsp; The lists of what mushrooms will grow on are nearly endless, but suffice it to say you can mix them all together and get better results than any one by itself.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to all and I apologize for the off-topic distraction.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8864973</next>\n<prev>8864872</prev>\n<first>8759541</first>\n<last>8871695</last>\n<when>1220369905</when>\n<utime>09/02/08 06:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
