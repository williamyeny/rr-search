{"key":"post-7598920","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7598920</id>\n<content>Some growers have reported very fast 'colonization' with extremely dark syringes.  Healthy, fresh spores will begin to germinate within 20 minutes of being placed into grains or agar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What hasn't ever been reported is nice flushes from very dark syringes.  Any time you have thousands of substrains, at least a few will be non-compatible and won't merge into a single organism, which inhibits fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, since no print is completely sterile, the more spores, the more contaminants that go along for the ride, thus often the contamination rates are higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even a dark syringe shouldn't turn totally black, and none should have gravel.  If there's no sectoring, it's likely that it was a culture syringe, as you suspect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7599026</next>\n<prev>7598842</prev>\n<first>7598213</first>\n<last>7611803</last>\n<when>1194301575</when>\n<utime>11/06/07 12:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
