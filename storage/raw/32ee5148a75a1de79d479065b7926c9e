I'll spray an ungodly amount of oust and scrub my walls. There's nothing for it to contaminate anyways, considering it's the only thing fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you don't know what you're doing or you wouldn't think Oust is going to kill mold spores.&amp;nbsp; Oust is for bacteria, and I'm not known for spreading 'bullshit' as you call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mold spores will stick to the floor, walls, you, your clothing, hair and everything else.&amp;nbsp; Screw up all your future grows that you want, but I'm not going to let this bullshit bad advice to others stand without challenge.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15520775</next>\n<prev>15519118</prev>\n<first>15518698</first>\n<last>15524577</last>\n<when>1323970064</when>\n<utime>12/15/11 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
