Without chlorophyll (which absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer) its simply not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think you fully thought that statement out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important to keep open minds.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium is as different from plants as we are, and much less studied than either one.&amp;nbsp; After more than 35 years of growing mushrooms both privately and commercially, I beg to disagree that light is just a pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; If you doubt this, run lights until you get a pinset, and then shut them off.&amp;nbsp; The fruits will be small and under-formed compared to a control group exposed to light the whole time.&amp;nbsp; That has all the hallmarks of deriving energy from the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, it's impossible to prove they are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; deriving energy from light, and since we know yields will be better with proper lighting from start to finish, there's no sense arguing over semantics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've ran many tests over the years with lights measured in wavelength, but have found from experience that the color temperature scale is very useful for our purposes.&amp;nbsp; Growers who have switched to +/- 6500 Kelvin fluorescent lighting have never come in and said it made no difference.&amp;nbsp; They've all reported better results than they had previously achieved.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11517944</next>\n<prev>11517849</prev>\n<first>11517681</first>\n<last>11518892</last>\n<when>1259084937</when>\n<utime>11/24/09 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
