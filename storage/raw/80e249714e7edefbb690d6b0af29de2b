{"key":"post-5734219","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5734219</id>\n<content>Kinda depends on what you mean by inoculation.  If you mean spores, then yes.  Too many spores results in generally poor performance even though the jar might 'colonize' sooner, if you define colonization as being all white.  Needless time and energy are expended in the process of anastomosis as the strains combine.  Since some strains are not capable of diaryotic pairings, they fruit as separate zones on the substrate.  This is why sometimes with multispore inoculation you get odd looking fruits that don't match the majority of the rest of the flushes, or second and third flushes look totally different from first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, another problem is if you get too much water and screw up your moisture content.  Wet jars colonize slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With liquid culture, the more the better as long as you don't get the substrate too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best is to follow the pf tek to the letter.  Experiment after you get a few grows down doing things the proven way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5734251</next>\n<prev>5734210</prev>\n<first>5734197</first>\n<last>5744632</last>\n<when>1149965957</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 09:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
