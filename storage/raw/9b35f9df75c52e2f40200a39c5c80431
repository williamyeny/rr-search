{"key":"post-6578076","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6578076</id>\n<content>There's a long thread on it over in advanced mycology.  Do a search there.  Monokaryotic Puerto Rico mycelium was allowed to crawl over the non-germinating original 20 year old redboy spores in a petri dish, resulting in a 50/50 cross between the redboy spores and the PR mycelium, without the original spores ever germinating, which they were no longer capable of after 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rattlesnake venom was added to the agar after cooling to weaken both the cell walls of the spores, and the cell walls of the mycelium, allowing the nucleus from each to exchange genetic information between them. The experiment was duplicated with the offspring, resulting in a 75% pure strain, which was then released to the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any additional discussion needs to be in the strain thread stickied at the top of the page please.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6578078</next>\n<prev>6578075</prev>\n<first>6578036</first>\n<last>6578078</last>\n<when>1171739612</when>\n<utime>02/17/07 09:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
