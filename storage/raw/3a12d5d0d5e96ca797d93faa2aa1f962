We dunk in the refrigerator to control bacterial growth during the dunk.  A dunk in room temp water would encourage bacteria, whether or not distilled water was used.  As soon as the cake is dropped in, the water is no longer clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to dunk when you're using the cake for spawn.  Just have the manure at the proper moisture content.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5198070</next>\n<prev>5197525</prev>\n<first>5197452</first>\n<last>5198208</last>\n<when>1137674032</when>\n<utime>01/19/06 02:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
