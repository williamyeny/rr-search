You should be able to colonize several jars of spawn by late January, which can then inoculate filter patch bags of sterilized hardwood sawdust/chips.  Allow those to fully colonize at indoor room temperature, then after last frost, spawn those bags into more chips in your bed.  This seems superior to trying to work with what is already in the ground.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6348901</prev>\n<first>6348901</first>\n<last>6348915</last>\n<when>1165629643</when>\n<utime>12/09/06 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
