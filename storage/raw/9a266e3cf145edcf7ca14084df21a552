This gives them time to consolidate their hold on the substrate while still in the clean confines of the jar where they're also not drying out.  If you birth right at full colonization, they won't fruit for a week to ten days anyway.  If you leave them for an extra week, then birth, dunk and roll, you'll probably see pins within 48 to 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6632829</next>\n<prev>6632529</prev>\n<first>6632313</first>\n<last>6632829</last>\n<when>1172984602</when>\n<utime>03/04/07 07:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
