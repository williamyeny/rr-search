When you spray oust, it completely fogs up the room.  I do about 30 seconds with a can in each hand, which really leaves a thick fog that kills airborne bacteria.  All you need for the glovebox is soap and water.  Don't forget to wash your gloves with alcohol after you put them on.  Be sure to break up the grain against a tire before putting the jars in the glovebox.  Wipe down each jar with alcohol.   Have the lids off the receiving jar for the minimum amount of time possible.  Never have more than the grain master and whatever receiving jar you're pouring to open at the same time.  Work fast, but without wild movements that might stir up dust within the glovebox.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7342046</next>\n<prev>7340714</prev>\n<first>7340359</first>\n<last>20937341</last>\n<when>1188258477</when>\n<utime>08/28/07 02:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
