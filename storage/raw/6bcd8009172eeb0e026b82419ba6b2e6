In fact, mushroom mycelium actually prefers an acidic substrate.  We pH balance casing material because it remains partially uncolonized throughout the fruiting cycle, thus is prone to contamination.  Bulk substrates colonize fully, thus are resistant to contaminants, so you can leave them slightly acidic and they'll do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium is more tolerant of a basic pH than molds, and that's why we add lime to casings.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7140045</next>\n<prev>7139097</prev>\n<first>7139089</first>\n<last>7141586</last>\n<when>1183782360</when>\n<utime>07/07/07 07:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
