My experiments over many years have shown potency not to be related to the substrate, provided you've given the mycelium what it needs to grow and produce fruits.  A proper substrate, whether it's manure, coir, straw, cased grains, or even pf cakes will all produce potent mushrooms, provided you have a good fruiting strain.  Potency is genetics related, not substrate, and trust me, I've used a lot of substrates and additives to try to find a correlation.  There simply isn't one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6682730</next>\n<prev>6682082</prev>\n<first>6681232</first>\n<last>6682969</last>\n<when>1174199556</when>\n<utime>03/18/07 09:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
