Vermiculite is a mineral that doesn't naturally harbor any endospores, and it's manufactured at extremely high temperatures so is sterile when packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if an open bag has been kicking around for a few months, it's likely had a lot of mold spores settle into the verm, so baking in the oven takes care of them.  I think it's a precaution worthy of the time it takes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7223913</next>\n<prev>7223697</prev>\n<first>7223538</first>\n<last>7225913</last>\n<when>1185415171</when>\n<utime>07/26/07 04:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
