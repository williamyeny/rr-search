{"key":"post-6735661","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6735661</id>\n<content>I long ago gave up on trying to identify bacteria.  I have a bunch of microscope slides I purchased from Boreal Labs for just that purpose, but it's a real pain in the ass.  It IS bacteria though, so the plate is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll inoculate several dishes, you might find one where some mushroom spores germinate, and you can then transfer them to a new dish.  By repeating the process a few times, you can usually isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminanants that way.  I've been able to get a lot of my strains from contaminated syringes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6737095</next>\n<prev>6734564</prev>\n<first>6734418</first>\n<last>6834501</last>\n<when>1175471963</when>\n<utime>04/02/07 02:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
