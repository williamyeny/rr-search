That isn't where your problem is.  If your bulk projects are contaminating prior to first flush, the problem is in your spawn.  You need to pay more attention to correct inoculation procedures, and have proper filters on your jars.  That means using a good glovebox even if that isn't what you wanted to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my DVD, I demonstrate making a laundry basket of straw, and a straw log on my nasty kitchen floor, and kitchens are the worst possible place to do sterile work.  The reason it succeeds is because once the spawn is colonized, it is resistant to contamination, and a properly pasteurized bulk substrate or casing material will not contaminate for two weeks, no matter what lands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fix your spawn generation procedure and your other problems will go away, provided you're not sterilizing the casing or bulk material.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7600041</next>\n<prev>7599610</prev>\n<first>7594812</first>\n<last>7603133</last>\n<when>1194315258</when>\n<utime>11/06/07 04:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
