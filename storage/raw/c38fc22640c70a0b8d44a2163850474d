If 1/3 of your jars cracked, the others also experienced the same stress.  If you popped the weight off the PC to let steam out, the moisture content of your surviving jars is probably also hosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they cracked from sitting directly on the bottom of the PC, chances are the substrate in the surviving jars is also cooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest making up a new batch of jars and correcting previous mistakes. Don't waste spores and time on what is a hit or miss scenario.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6081112</prev>\n<first>6080708</first>\n<last>6081475</last>\n<when>1158762271</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 05:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
