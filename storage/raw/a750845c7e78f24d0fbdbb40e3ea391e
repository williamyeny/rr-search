I do it in a large pot of water, with a plate sitting on top of the cakes, to keep them submerged.  Deeper in the water is better than on top because there's more pressure from the water at the bottom of the kettle.  Rinse the cakes under the faucet before and after the 24 hour soak.  You can use the refrigerator, or simply find a cool place to set them while the cakes are soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're mid flush, you can use the saucer to help get some moisture to the cake.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7728924</next>\n<prev>7725592</prev>\n<first>7722198</first>\n<last>7741373</last>\n<when>1196990462</when>\n<utime>12/07/07 03:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
