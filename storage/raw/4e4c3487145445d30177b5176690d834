It's great for plants, but is already used up for mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bagged cow manure is fine once you spread it out in the sun for a week or two to allow the ammonia to flash off.  After that, mix it with coir or verm to fluff it up so the mycelium can penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horse manure is excellent because it's the correct texture without adding anything to it.  You need field aged nuggets that are at least a couple of months old.  If there is any smell to them whatsoever, leave them outside in the sun until they're odorless, then they're ready to pasteurize and use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6035913</next>\n<prev>6035877</prev>\n<first>6035828</first>\n<last>6038761</last>\n<when>1157589017</when>\n<utime>09/07/06 03:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
