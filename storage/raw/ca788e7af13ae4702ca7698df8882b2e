These are antibiotic compounds that the mycelium produces to kill competitor fungi or bacteria.  They are not in any way, shape or form related to the urine that is secreted by mammals.  The metabolites produced by mycelium of the penicillium fungus for example are used in human medicine as antibiotics to kill bacteria.  The metabolites produced by mushroom mycelium serve a similar purpose.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6853363</prev>\n<first>6853188</first>\n<last>6853816</last>\n<when>1177958577</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 09:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
