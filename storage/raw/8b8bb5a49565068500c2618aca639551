Leaving the foil in place causes condensation, which gets the dry vermiculite filter damp, making it useless.&amp;nbsp; You'll have a lower chance and rate of contamination if you keep the verm filter dry.&amp;nbsp; Remove tape from the holes if it's not breathable tape too.&amp;nbsp; Colonizing jars need those holes open for gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Normal room lighting is fine during colonization.&amp;nbsp; In fact, there is a LOT of evidence to show that it helps later when it comes time for pinning.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium has a circadian rhythm just like animals.&amp;nbsp; Expose to normal ambient lighting to help establish this rhythm.&amp;nbsp; The old advice to colonize in darkness is outdated and incorrect.&amp;nbsp; Paul Stamets, who wrote to keep colonizing jars in the dark in his book &quot;The Mushroom Cultivator&quot; disavowed that advice and corrected it 8 years later when he published &quot;Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms&quot;, yet people keep repeating the bad advice 18 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Use a glovebox or still air box for inoculations.&amp;nbsp; The latter is what is demonstrated in 'Let's Grow Mushrooms'.&amp;nbsp; Never inoculate in open air.&amp;nbsp; Some people are satisfied with loosing ten to twenty percent of their jars to contamination due to carelessness or laziness.&amp;nbsp; I am not.&amp;nbsp; A 1% failure rate is too much.&amp;nbsp; Don't inoculate in a kitchen or bathroom. Those are the two filthiest places in any house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Let your jars colonize in normal room temperature on an open shelf.&amp;nbsp; The circulating air will provide gas exchange and keep your verm filter dry.&amp;nbsp; The verm filter catches and traps contaminants before they get to the brf below.&amp;nbsp; When you birth the jars a week or more after full colonization, rinse the verm filter off under the faucet as shown in the video before dunking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Next time, use spring or tap water to make your substrate jars.&amp;nbsp; Distilled water lacks essential minerals for healthy mycelium, and also leads to a higher rate of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9886282</next>\n<prev>9885989</prev>\n<first>9874554</first>\n<last>10191028</last>\n<when>1235871427</when>\n<utime>03/01/09 03:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
