It's not the moisture in the air, just moisture I've added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is.  Not only will the added water evaporate into the air, but the moisture that the substrate and fruits themselves absorb, help to prevent them from drying out, which is what high humidity also does.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8024719</next>\n<prev>8024702</prev>\n<first>8024609</first>\n<last>8025200</last>\n<when>1203050846</when>\n<utime>02/15/08 06:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
