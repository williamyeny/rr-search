Growers who boil without a soak tend to get a lot of burst grains.   Be sure to soak for at least three to four hours in hot tap water. That should soften up the shells so they don't rupture when you simmer or boil.  When the grains have doubled their original dry size, they're ready to drain, dry and load into jars.   The boil helps to dry the surface of the grains by pouring them into your strainer while still hot.  The steam evaporates off the surface, leaving them at the proper moisture content inside, while still dry on the outside. Add a tablespoon of gypsum to each two gallons of soak water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm really not sure what caused all those burst grains.  I've honestly never seen that many in a jar.  Perhaps someone else will have some tips for you.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6609071</next>\n<prev>6608779</prev>\n<first>6608779</first>\n<last>6611360</last>\n<when>1172442227</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 12:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
