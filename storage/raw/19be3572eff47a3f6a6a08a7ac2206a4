As the cells engorge with water, there's no evidence that they increase in potency as well.  The 'veil tearing' is just a signpost along the way that indicates a good time to pick.  It has nothing in and of itself to do with potency.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7513379</next>\n<prev>7513333</prev>\n<first>7506949</first>\n<last>7518863</last>\n<when>1192327785</when>\n<utime>10/14/07 05:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
