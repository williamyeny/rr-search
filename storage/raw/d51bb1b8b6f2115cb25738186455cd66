Depending on where you live, and the ambient contaminant spore load, you might get away with doing things the easy way.  As an experiment, I recently sterilized some horse manure and casing mix, and every single tray bloomed with trich either just before or during first flush.  I live near a very large rainforest and am an avid backpacker, so I, and the winds constantly bring billions of trich spores into my house.  Pasteurization works, but sterilization of substrates and casings in my locale definitely do not work.  These were the first projects of mine to get trich in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5732377</prev>\n<first>5731768</first>\n<last>5732650</last>\n<when>1149917524</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 08:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
