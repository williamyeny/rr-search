It's an expensive way to grow though.  You can buy oak fence posts at the lumber yard for a fraction of the price and saw them up if you can't find chipped hardwood in your area. You still need course hardwood sawdust though. Inoculate them with colonized grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6353868</next>\n<prev>6353462</prev>\n<first>6330383</first>\n<last>6353868</last>\n<when>1165768897</when>\n<utime>12/10/06 06:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
