If you sterilize, cobweb and the green molds will have little trouble colonizing your substrate before the mushroom mycelium can.  Remember, pasteurize bulk substrates such as straw, coir, coffee grinds, manure etc., by heating to 140F to 170F for an hour.  That means the interior of the bag or jar needs to be maintained at those temperatures for an hour.  Whatever method you use, stick a meat thermometer into the center of the substrate to monitor temps until you get your system worked out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5890586</next>\n<prev>5890567</prev>\n<first>5890106</first>\n<last>5891503</last>\n<when>1153683217</when>\n<utime>07/23/06 10:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
