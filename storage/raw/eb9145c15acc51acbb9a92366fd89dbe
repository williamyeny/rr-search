When the cakes expand to the edge of the jar, they stop taking in water, and can be a real bitch to get back out of the jar later.  I'd suggest removing from the jars, rinse under the faucet, and then put in your container and find a plate or some other object to hold them submerged.  A larger jar, such as a quart or gallon pickle jar works well because you can fill it all the way to the top, put the cakes in and then screw the lid down, which holds the cakes under water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7126652</next>\n<prev>7126380</prev>\n<first>7126068</first>\n<last>7134652</last>\n<when>1183523952</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 07:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
