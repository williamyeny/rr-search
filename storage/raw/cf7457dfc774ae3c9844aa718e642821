Don't let all those trich spores release in your house or they will haunt you for years, especially if you have carpet.  Never use alcohol in a tub.  If you want to cover the trich with something to slow down its spread, use a thick layer of salt.  The high pH of the salt will zap the trichoderma mycelium.  I'll repeat the 'take it outside' for emphasis.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7072029</next>\n<prev>7071687</prev>\n<first>7071652</first>\n<last>7072029</last>\n<when>1182394855</when>\n<utime>06/21/07 06:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
