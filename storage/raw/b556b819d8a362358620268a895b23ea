(or a bell reducer and nipple so you can use the AA relief valve)&amp;nbsp; If you're not equipped with the tools or knowledge to do this, take it to a machine or boiler shop and they can take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9423127</next>\n<prev>9421181</prev>\n<first>9420874</first>\n<last>9435277</last>\n<when>1229142601</when>\n<utime>12/13/08 06:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
