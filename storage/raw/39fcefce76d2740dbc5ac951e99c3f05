The mushrooms don't use the light to grow. They just use it as a pinning trigger, and they grow towards the light. So i try to center it above my terrarium. How high is up to you, but it is not necessary for it to be really close to the mushrooms. If you place it off to the side, the mushrooms may begin growing in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're correct that the light should be outside the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; Incorrect on the mushrooms don't use light to grow.&amp;nbsp; You directly contradicted yourself by saying they'll grow towards the light but don't use it.&amp;nbsp; If they're not using the light, why the heck would they grow towards it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms do not just use light as a pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Light is only a secondary pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms do however use light as a source of energy, and this is why they tend to orient their caps towards it: to receive the maximum possible energy from the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to have the light as close as possible to the mushrooms to give them the maximum exposure to the light without causing excessive heat buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light should not be directly above the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; It should be above and to one side of the terrarium for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14802343</next>\n<prev>14802313</prev>\n<first>14802044</first>\n<last>14815182</last>\n<when>1311262764</when>\n<utime>07/21/11 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
