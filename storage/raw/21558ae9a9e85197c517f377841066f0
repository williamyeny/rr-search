So how the fuck did water get in them?  I am pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil can prevent drips from getting into jars, but it's not a sealer.  In fact, the foil can channel water, causing the very problem you're trying to avoid.  It's always best to stick to the tek word for word the first few times.  With experience, you'll be able to experiment with variations, but not at first.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5692878</next>\n<prev>5689957</prev>\n<first>5689834</first>\n<last>5693249</last>\n<when>1148999709</when>\n<utime>05/30/06 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
