The number of holes is irrelevant if they're not large enough to provide 4 air exchanges per hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a substrate is fully colonized, the pinning triggers then become increased air exchange, near 100% humidity with a steady rate of evaporation from the casing layer or substrate, and bright, high frequency or full spectrum lighting.  Natural daylight fluorescent is the best artificial lighting, with cool white fluorescent a close second.  Incandescent lighting is worst.  Fan often and increase your light exposure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6772519</next>\n<prev>6771587</prev>\n<first>6771587</first>\n<last>6782050</last>\n<when>1176261056</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
