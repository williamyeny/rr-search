I use 20 grams of malt, 1 gram of yeast, a tiny pinch of gypsum, and a small pinch of powdered sawdust for each liter of water in liquid cultures, then keep it under constant stir for five days, at which time it's ready to use.  If you allow LC to go longer than five days post eberbach, the mycelium begins to grow into a solid organism which is not nearly as effective to inoculate with as a few million individual colonies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don't use PDA for Petri dishes or anything else.  In my experience, it doesn't begin to compare with MEA.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5972344</next>\n<prev>5972321</prev>\n<first>5972321</first>\n<last>5972436</last>\n<when>1155826512</when>\n<utime>08/17/06 05:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
