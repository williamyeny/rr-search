They can be killed off in the houseplant soil by soaking the entire pot from the soil line below in the sink for 24 hours.  This drowns the adults and larvae. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas suggested above all work, and you can also use the vacuum cleaner to suck them out of the FC.  If you'll cut a lemon or lime in half and leave one of the halves near your grow, they'll congregrate on the lemon rather than your mycelium.
