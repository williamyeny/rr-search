Every Martha and even a few mono tube setups ive seen run a cool mist 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No they don't.&amp;nbsp; If they did, it would result in a flood.&amp;nbsp; You refer to the 'wicking type' humidifier,(with a wet pad inside) and it's been posted here many times that those are not suitable for mycology.&amp;nbsp; Not only do they grow black mold in the wicking filter, they don't produce the humidity required for mushrooms, thus they dry out the substrate as well as the air.&amp;nbsp; Use impeller type cool mists on a cycle timer for greenhouses, and perlite for terrariums. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8680632</next>\n<prev>8680459</prev>\n<first>8676642</first>\n<last>8685206</last>\n<when>1217015831</when>\n<utime>07/25/08 10:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
