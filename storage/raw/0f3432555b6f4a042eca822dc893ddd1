Colonize your trays on a shelf in a warm room.  If the room is too cold, run a space heater.  Any temperature in the 70's to very low 80's is great for colonizing bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't try to heat a mini-greenhouse.  Most mushroom species will fruit very well in the sixties, cubes included.  If the room gets too cold, again run a space heater, but don't try to heat the greenhouse itself.  All you'll do is make condensation on the walls.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6161521</next>\n<prev>6161394</prev>\n<first>6161394</first>\n<last>6161526</last>\n<when>1160667592</when>\n<utime>10/12/06 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
