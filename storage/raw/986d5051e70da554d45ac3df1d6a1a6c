Sometimes, even with a clean sporeprint, you'll get a bit of contamination on the dish along with the mushroom mycelium.  This is easy to transfer away from, by taking a small piece of mushroom mycelium and moving it to a new dish.  Always take mycelium from the leading edge of the growth because this is the farthest away from the contaminant.  We also transfer individual sectors away from each other so individual strains can grow out to determine the best fruiting ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cloning wild mushrooms, there's almost always molds and bacteria present, so it takes several transfers to get a clean culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a full strain isolation and cloning tek on my DVD with very clear, closeup pictures(video) so that should make it much easier to understand for visual learners.  I'll let everybody know when it's out.  Everytime I try to give a release date, I get some new software or graphics, and 'have' to put them in too and it sets the time back.  I'm also &lt;i&gt;seriously&lt;/i&gt; anal about quality, so have filmed many of the segments again and again until I'm happy with them.  It all takes time.  It shouldn't be more than a month or two though, but I'm also working on copyrights and trademarks to protect my work, so I have to wait for the lawyers on that one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6674378</next>\n<prev>6673505</prev>\n<first>6669932</first>\n<last>6674404</last>\n<when>1174004268</when>\n<utime>03/16/07 03:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
