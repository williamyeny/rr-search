Take hyphae's, Agar's or my advice that has been posted dozens of times about lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myth:  If you can see the tray, it has enough light.&lt;br /&gt;Reality:  Bullshit.   Bright, high frequency light is much better.  Natural daylight fluorescent or metal halide will give the best pinsets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myth:  You only need a few minutes of light per day.&lt;br /&gt;Reality:  Bullshit.  12/12 has been proved for years and years to be many times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't find the experienced growers making those silly statements.  Fluorescent light gives the most bang for the buck with the lowest heat output.  Incandescent gives the lowest bang for the buck with the highest heat output.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6696630</next>\n<prev>6696168</prev>\n<first>6694233</first>\n<last>6698939</last>\n<when>1174525910</when>\n<utime>03/22/07 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
