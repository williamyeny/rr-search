I didn't use a glove box, instead i wiped down all surfaces in small bathroom with bleach, and spray a whole can of Lysol inside and outside the room 10 minutes before we entered the room. We also wore clean clothes, sprayed our selves down with Lysol, also we wore gloves or washed our hands, and we wore dust masks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time follow proper sterile procedure as demonstrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;BRF Tek&lt;/a&gt; and other videos on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lysol does NOTHING for the air.&amp;nbsp; It's a surface disinfectant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after hand washing, your skin is teeming with trillions of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dust masks do NOTHING to stop exhaled bacteria.&amp;nbsp; If you're mowing the lawn, they'll help keep dirt out of your nose, but that's all they're good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always flame sterilize a needle until red hot and then use it while still hot.&amp;nbsp; The first drop or two of solution cools the needle and the rest then flows cleanly into the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12531123</next>\n<prev>12531094</prev>\n<first>12531055</first>\n<last>12531599</last>\n<when>1273422798</when>\n<utime>05/09/10 07:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
