{"key":"post-6666466","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6666466</id>\n<content>I suggest to wait one week past full colonization.  The reason is that at full colonization, the job is not complete.  The mycelium must then 'consolidate' its hold on the substrate.  Only then will it fruit.  This process takes about a week.  Therefore, of you birth early, it sits there drying out for that week.  Let it 'consolidate' in the jar and it doesn't dry out.  Therefore, wait one week past full colonization, dunk and roll, then place in terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6666479</next>\n<prev>6666454</prev>\n<first>6666425</first>\n<last>6667544</last>\n<when>1173839951</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 05:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
