You want near 100% humidity, 70F to 75F temperature, and lots of air exchange.  You can soak your substrate overnight and then return to fruiting conditions, even with pins on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By lifting your substrate, you should be able to get a feel for moisture content by judging the weight.  This is a learned process, so when you make fresh substrates, see how much they weigh, and then later on you can adjust moisture content based on the feel when you lift one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7986739</next>\n<prev>7986611</prev>\n<first>7986507</first>\n<last>7986932</last>\n<when>1202328663</when>\n<utime>02/06/08 10:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
