The 'incubation' room is the first 20 feet and will be heavily insulated.&amp;nbsp; I anticipate the substrate heat will be enough to keep things at 70F year 'round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll attack all that later.&amp;nbsp; For the next week, I'm welding the iron supports to hold up the ceiling from several hundred tons of soil, plus 5 or more feet of snow during winter.&amp;nbsp; After that, it all has to be painted, concrete poured in the grow room, and lots of other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the mrs and I make it a point to round up the dogs and go hiking or backpacking at least two days a week, plus we have a fruit orchard, an organic garden, and several bee hives to take care of as well.&amp;nbsp; Besides all that, it's pretty busy around here these days, and I actually thought I was 'retired'. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10416986</next>\n<prev>10416745</prev>\n<first>10413482</first>\n<last>10445761</last>\n<when>1243573647</when>\n<utime>05/29/09 08:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
