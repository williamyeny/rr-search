Never use distilled water. It will lead to a higher rate of contamination, plus the minerals in tap, creek, lake, etc., water are beneficial to the mycelium. You have the proportions right at 2-1-1, but make sure the dry verm is the top layer, at least 1/2 to 3/4 (1cm) thick.&amp;nbsp; 15 psi for 45 minutes is fine, or you can steam sterilize in a pot without pressure for 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Never use Lysol in a glovebox.&amp;nbsp; Simply wash it out with soap and water and leave wet.&amp;nbsp; The wet sides will trap and hold contaminant spores via molecular adhesion.&amp;nbsp; Never wipe your needle with an alcohol soaked towel or anything else.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to flame sterilize the needle until red-hot before the first jar and between each jar.&amp;nbsp; Use while still hot.&amp;nbsp; The first drop of solution cools the needle.&amp;nbsp; Alcohol doesn't kill everything and it kills &lt;i&gt;nothing on the inside&lt;/i&gt; of the needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Never put jars in a sealed up tub, regardless of temperature.&amp;nbsp; 75F is fine, but the black bag prevents light from reaching your jars, and normal ambient room light is beneficial from day one.&amp;nbsp; Most people colonize jars on a book shelf in an open room out of direct sunlight, but not in total darkness either.&amp;nbsp; It's common for it to take over 7 days from spores to see visible growth with the naked eye.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure you've tossed out some perfectly fine jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's obvious that you haven't found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek videos&lt;/a&gt; yet.&amp;nbsp; Watch all four and follow them to the letter.&amp;nbsp; Don't cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15405308</next>\n<prev>15405018</prev>\n<first>15403554</first>\n<last>15420584</last>\n<when>1321933630</when>\n<utime>11/22/11 05:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
