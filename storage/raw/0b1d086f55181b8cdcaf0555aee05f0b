Yes, I've had success with it, but my time is more valuable than spending three days sterilizing a jar.  In addition, those who have followed my posts know I don't recommend anything because it's easy &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; hard, cheap &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;r expensive.  I try to recommend what has the greatest chance of success.  That isn't always the most expensive way, nor the easiest way, but it's my definition of the best way.  When it comes to grains, they should be pressure sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6597206</next>\n<prev>6597189</prev>\n<first>6597090</first>\n<last>6597265</last>\n<when>1172172882</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 09:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
