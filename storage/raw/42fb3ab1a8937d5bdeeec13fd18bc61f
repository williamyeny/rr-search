With them full length, they don't allow your arms to move back and forth sideways while you work, which restricts movement.  All you need to attach the gloves is the width of your hose clamp, so you can use a hack saw to cut the rest of the flange off, increasing your range of motion while working. Do the same on the outside threaded part.  you can cut it all the way down to the last thread. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6458288</next>\n<prev>6457826</prev>\n<first>6457332</first>\n<last>6458348</last>\n<when>1168786536</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
