I've even seen large fruitings on Douglas fir.  Make sure you have a few nice sized pieces of wood in there, because they tend to produce the best fruits.  Sawdust mixed with a bit of soil will help fill in the gaps around the chips.  Try not to keep them too wet, or mold will be a problem.  I let mine dry out quite a bit before watering.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7677155</prev>\n<first>7677155</first>\n<last>7677179</last>\n<when>1196005371</when>\n<utime>11/25/07 05:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
