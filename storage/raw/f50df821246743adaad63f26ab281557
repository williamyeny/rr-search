If carpeted, mist the carpet itself well with water to prevent dust becoming airborne out of it.  Spray oust in the air for one minute.  In fact, I spray oust in a small bedroom for one minute, with a can in each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before working in a glove box, spray the inside with water mist. Use the same mister you use on your mushrooms.  Having the water droplets all around the glovebox will attract and hold any contaminants that come in contact with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work very fast.  A petri dish should be open no more than a few seconds, five at most.  Allow your agar to cool in the filtered bottle you sterilize it in, right up until it's almost too thick to pour.  Remember, as the agar cools, it shrinks, and when it shrinks it draws in air to replace the volume, thus it draws whatever else is in the air too, including contaminant spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you pour the dishes, slip them right back into the sleeve or a zip lock bag to cool.  Keep them in the sealed bag until you inoculate, at which time you want to immediately wrap with parafilm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider the flowhood mandatory for agar work, but that's mainly because my 40 year old condo building in a wet climate is so mold infested as to be dangerous, and I also consider any less than a 99% success rate to be a failure.  I still use my glovebox when isolating wild species, because I don't want the flowhood blowing contaminant spores all over the room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7960574</next>\n<prev>7960364</prev>\n<first>7960346</first>\n<last>7961008</last>\n<when>1201816643</when>\n<utime>01/31/08 11:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
