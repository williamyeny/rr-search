Wet salt works better.  You can also make a paste out of hydrated lime and apply that to the trich.  Cover the entire area plus half an inch or so all the way around.  It's the ph of 13 that kills the mold.  It also kills the mushroom mycelium in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6187306</next>\n<prev>6186415</prev>\n<first>6186284</first>\n<last>6187306</last>\n<when>1161295832</when>\n<utime>10/20/06 01:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
