Mycelium will generally grow aggressively for several months.  Your isolations will be done within a month to six weeks.  At that point, save all your strains in the refrigerator to stop growth(more accurately-slow the growth way down).  When the cells stop dividing, the road to senescence gets much longer.  This means that two years from now, you can pull a master slant out of the refrigerator and it will realistically only have that original six weeks worth of cell divisions on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7918082</next>\n<prev>7917948</prev>\n<first>7895760</first>\n<last>8016395</last>\n<when>1201069242</when>\n<utime>01/23/08 08:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
