This also happens to be the exact same engineering principal that makes the shotgun terrarium perform so well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large surface area in contact with the earth also negates the need for any heat or AC.&amp;nbsp; So far, I've observed the grow room over a 80F temperature swing(It's been as hot as 105F outside and as cool so far as 25F) and the internal temp has not even varied by 1 degree.&amp;nbsp; It stays at 58F.&amp;nbsp; I have no reason to suspect that this winter when it's -30, it will change from that same 58F, which is ground temperature at that depth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't cut the top layer of substrate off after a flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light is required not only for pinning, but for proper mushroom development as well.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium derives energy from light.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown without sufficient lighting are weak, thin and have little weight compared to mushrooms grown with proper lighting.&amp;nbsp; That's why I have over 400 watts of 6500 Kelvin LED lighting in my grow room.&amp;nbsp; It's as bright as daylight in there, and the walls are painted bright white to reflect the light around the room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11004351</next>\n<prev>11003963</prev>\n<first>10963940</first>\n<last>11018725</last>\n<when>1252177008</when>\n<utime>09/05/09 09:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
