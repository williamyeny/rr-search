Adjust so a cigarette lighter held in the work area will have the flame bent from 45 to 90 degrees without flickering or blowing out.  You can also get a motor speed controller.  They're less than $100 for a motor that size.  A piece of metal or even cardboard over the intake is much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6141605</next>\n<prev>6141324</prev>\n<first>6129325</first>\n<last>6141605</last>\n<when>1160182484</when>\n<utime>10/07/06 03:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
