Pf cakes can produce yields and potency to match any bulk substrate out there. In fact, there's no bulk substrate material that you can use in the quantities of a brf cake that will produce even close to brf.  It's neither a beginner nor a novelty method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest switching away from corn as a spawn.  It's the absolute worst possible choice.  Try rye berries as first choice, and wbs as second.  You have to remember that the grains you use as spawn are a major part of the overall substrate you fruit from.  Corn can support mycelium growth, but provides very little in the way of food for the fruiting stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always add up to ten percent by volume of gypsum to any bulk substrate.  It can increase yields substantially.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7039687</next>\n<prev>7039638</prev>\n<first>7038770</first>\n<last>7043735</last>\n<when>1181705548</when>\n<utime>06/13/07 06:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
