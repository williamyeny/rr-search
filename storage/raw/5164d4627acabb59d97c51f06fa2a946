They don't want RR to say it the way he's been saying it because it's technically incorrect is what I gather.. Personally I don't think academic snobbery has any place in a farmers' forum but whatever.. It's a good read anyway.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a technically correct fact of science is that light is energy. Light is natures ways of transferring energy through space. Unless someone wants to argue that light is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; energy, then any organism which uses light to increase its mass is using energy from that light.
