No soaks, no boils, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anno, Prisoner, agar all posted they go bareback in the PC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do heavyweights like RR still maintain a 4-24 hour soak followed by a boil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll notice those threads are all nearly 8 years old, and were from before &quot;Let's Grow Mushrooms&quot; was released.&amp;nbsp; They were following TMC, the only guide at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've learned a lot since then, and the rinse, soak, boil method is the industry standard these days.&amp;nbsp; Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;commercial mushroom farm&lt;/a&gt; produces hundreds of pounds of rye spawn per month and we do it exactly as shown in the video.&amp;nbsp; If you look at the commercial spawn labs, they also follow that technique.&amp;nbsp; Nobody mixes water and grains and then cooks them.&amp;nbsp; If you have super fast colonization, I can nearly guarantee you're growing mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Let's Grow Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; does not recommend 'simmering'.&amp;nbsp; I use a &lt;b&gt;rapid boil&lt;/b&gt;, followed by drying the grains.&amp;nbsp; This results in the perfect moisture content, and the best chance of success.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't mean other methods are sure-fail, but that the soak, boil, dry method gives the best success rate, bar none.&amp;nbsp; We wouldn't do it hundreds of times per month if it didn't give us the highest success rate.&amp;nbsp; In our operation selling mushrooms to grocery stores at only $6/pound wholesale, a 1% fail rate means the difference between making a profit and going hungry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15373245</next>\n<prev>15367540</prev>\n<first>15366989</first>\n<last>18386842</last>\n<when>1321292682</when>\n<utime>11/14/11 07:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
