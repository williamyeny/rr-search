The calcium wouldn't lower pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I understand it, gypsum is more of a nutritional supplement, than a soil conditioner, as it's presence promotes mycelial growth and is not added for pH adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur and Calcium are two things myc likes, but rye is poor in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, that's right on.  Gypsum isn't used to adjust the pH.  A side benefit of gypsum is it tends to hold the pH stable, preventing a swing to acidic conditions caused by metabolism of the fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur and calcium are both essential for good fruitbody formation, so gypsum helps to ensure that our substrates have plenty.  In addition, it's a soil conditioner that helps prevent clumping.  In some species, such as Shiitake, gypsum has shown a 20% increase in yields over the same subsrate without gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7838256</next>\n<prev>7838206</prev>\n<first>7715228</first>\n<last>11861962</last>\n<when>1199622760</when>\n<utime>01/06/08 02:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
