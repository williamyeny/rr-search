Don't listen to the naysayers who will say they cause contamination.  Simply replace them every few days and you'll be fine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use trays of perlite to catch drips, but in the areas where the trays won't reach such as around the legs of the shelves, I use paper or cloth towels.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7975208</next>\n<prev>7974934</prev>\n<first>7974882</first>\n<last>7988212</last>\n<when>1202096213</when>\n<utime>02/04/08 05:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
