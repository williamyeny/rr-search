You only need to shake once at 20% to 30% colonization.  Your second and fourth jar above look about done.  Give them a few days past full colonization before spawning to bulk.  The third jar needs a few days.  They'll all look like the first jar after shaking.  That's normal.  Shake just before spawning by banging the jar against a tire, and then layer into your manure or whatever you're using as bulk.  The mycelium on the grains will recover right into the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7077393</next>\n<prev>7077293</prev>\n<first>7054463</first>\n<last>7086965</last>\n<when>1182481908</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 06:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
