A tip for taking clear pictures of jars is to not hold it in one hand and the camera in the other hand.  That doubles the amount of movement, thus blurring the picture.  Also, place a light at a 45 degree angle to the jar, and turn off the camera flash.  That will prevent glare from coming back at you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6585931</prev>\n<first>6585563</first>\n<last>6587005</last>\n<when>1171941662</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 05:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
