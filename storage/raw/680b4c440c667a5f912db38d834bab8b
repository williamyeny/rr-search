However, there was a small crack in the plastic container, so some water ran out. However, since the mushrooms started to grow I wasnt sure wether it would matter or not. Could it be that the material didnt soak up enough water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is the cause, is it too late to add more water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your substrate is too dry.&amp;nbsp; Put it back under a faucet and let it gently run for an hour or so and then put the tray back into fruiting after draining.&amp;nbsp; You need more light.&amp;nbsp; Put it closer to the window or put a bright fluorescent lamp just above the terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19935431</next>\n<prev>19935312</prev>\n<first>19935138</first>\n<last>19941323</last>\n<when>1399128294</when>\n<utime>05/03/14 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
