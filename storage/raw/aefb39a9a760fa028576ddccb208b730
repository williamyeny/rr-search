Five minutes 'on' time might be a bit much, but you could block part of the intake to the fan to cut down on flow.  Just tweak the system to give the most air exchange you can without drying out the cakes.  It will require a bit of trial and error to find the sweet spot.  Make sure you have a good analog hygrometer that can be calibrated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6664365</next>\n<prev>6664344</prev>\n<first>6663702</first>\n<last>6664365</last>\n<when>1173806708</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 08:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
