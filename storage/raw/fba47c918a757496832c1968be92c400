In the past I was doing gtg to countless jars without issue, but the generations were getting too high.&amp;nbsp; Really just looking for a way to preserve a master which i can draw MANY jars of spawn from repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like grain lc's best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-called grain LC sucks too, and I wish I'd never released that tek a few years ago.&amp;nbsp; Going from grain to liquid and back to grain adds an unnecessary additional vector of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preserve your cultures, use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Master-Culture-Slants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;master culture slants.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir from hydroponic shops often has trichoderma added.&amp;nbsp; They germinate the trichoderma and inoculate the coir before it's dried.&amp;nbsp; Once hydrated, the trich grows again.&amp;nbsp; It's best to get coir from pet shops if you're using that for a substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>13669458</prev>\n<first>13664521</first>\n<last>13669601</last>\n<when>1293031830</when>\n<utime>12/22/10 05:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
