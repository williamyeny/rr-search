Don't use a sealed jar, which traps moisture that is inside the cap, which amounts to 90% of its total weight.  Also, why PC the jar when you can't PC the mushroom itself?  I'd suggest taking prints on foil in a glovebox.  You can cover the cap while it prints with a sheet of tyvek for extra protection if desired.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6577463</next>\n<prev>6577389</prev>\n<first>6577389</first>\n<last>6580302</last>\n<when>1171727535</when>\n<utime>02/17/07 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
