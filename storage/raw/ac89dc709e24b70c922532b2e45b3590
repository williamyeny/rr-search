Let them be &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a lot like saying you don't need to drive sober because the steel in your car body will protect you when you crash.&amp;nbsp; A verm layer can shift when you look at the jars, thus a layer of micropore tape adds an extra layer of protection.&amp;nbsp; Guys, we don't make this shit up.&amp;nbsp; The recommendation for micropore tape was based on many years of experience to determine what gives the best chance for success.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17066442</next>\n<prev>17066320</prev>\n<first>17039794</first>\n<last>17089806</last>\n<when>1350749260</when>\n<utime>10/20/12 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
