Early in development, they will turn towards a source of wind.&amp;nbsp; Later, as they develop into actual mushrooms, they will orient their caps towards a light source to derive as much energy from it as possible.&amp;nbsp; They don't use light to 'know which way to grow' but rather turn towards it to get as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19825117</next>\n<prev>19824968</prev>\n<first>19824117</first>\n<last>19826205</last>\n<when>1397176594</when>\n<utime>04/11/14 03:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
