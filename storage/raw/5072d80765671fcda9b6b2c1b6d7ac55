{"key":"post-1412111","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>1412111</id>\n<content>when ya try to save a project with the green monster, you only create more problems for yourself.  Trich is actually white, but the spores are green.  When you mess with it, you release thousands and thousands of spores into your grow area to infect the rest of your project.  When I find it, I spray with a bleach solution so the stuff is wet, then carry it right outside and bury it.  Be sure to change your clothes, bathe, wash your hair, etc. before you go back into the grow area.   This is the only way I know to beat it back. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1412286</next>\n<prev>1412010</prev>\n<first>1411937</first>\n<last>1413535</last>\n<when>1048719223</when>\n<utime>03/27/03 12:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
