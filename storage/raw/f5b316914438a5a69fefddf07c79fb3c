I couldn't tell them apart from looking, or performance, from brown rice flour once put into the jars. Today, I drove to Spokane, WA to pick up a few dozen bee hives I bought from a guy who's retiring, and stopped at a feed store to get some other supplies while in the &lt;i&gt;big city&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot; title=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; They had fifty pound bags of rice bran sold as horse feed supplement, so I bought one.&amp;nbsp; I'll make up a few cakes next week and see how it works.&amp;nbsp; Brans are normally more nutritious than flours since they have the whole enchilada intact instead of just the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works out, the rice bran was $18 for a fifty pound bag, so it's a hell of a lot cheaper than brown rice and was already ground, although in flakes like oatmeal instead of flour.&amp;nbsp; If it doesn't work well for cakes, at least I know it's a good sawdust supplement for my shiitake blocks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10062300</next>\n<prev>10062206</prev>\n<first>10056995</first>\n<last>10062300</last>\n<when>1238294355</when>\n<utime>03/29/09 05:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
