You can order hydrated lime online.  Check our vendors.  I'm pretty sure a few have it.  If not, you can order it from best hardware.  Just do a search for hydrated lime when you get to their site.  Be sure to use 'horticultural' hydrated lime, not the stuff for concrete or steel work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't use baking soda.  The salt is toxic to fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7363940</next>\n<prev>7363882</prev>\n<first>7362203</first>\n<last>7363945</last>\n<when>1188832246</when>\n<utime>09/03/07 06:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
