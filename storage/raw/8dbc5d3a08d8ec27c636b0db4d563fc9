That's the Shroomery for you. It's tricky enough learning how to do this without bad advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You better watch yourself, because it's YOU who is wrong.  Brown rice flour does not harbor bacterial endospores, so boiling for an hour to two hours is more than sufficient to achieve success.  Grains need to be pressure cooked, but no such requirement exists with brf.  I've made hundreds, if not thousands of brf cakes and the only one that contaminated was where I needed a picture of green mold for the video, so I scraped the syringe across the carpet before inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voice your opinions and experiences people, but keep it nice.  The facts are clear.  If you boil a brf cake for two hours and it contaminates, it's because you did something &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt; wrong.  Water boils at 212F, and molds are killed off at 140F.  That's a fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7481336</next>\n<prev>7481314</prev>\n<first>7480953</first>\n<last>8003908</last>\n<when>1191444199</when>\n<utime>10/03/07 11:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
