{"key":"post-5819108","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5819108</id>\n<content>I've used perlite/peat before with ok results.  The perlite helps to aerate the casing layer, but also tends to dry out faster than vermiculite so be sure to mist more often.  Look in your area for anything you can find to 'fluff up' the peat.  You want your casing layer nice and loose.  Don't forget lime and gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5819184</next>\n<prev>5819096</prev>\n<first>5819096</first>\n<last>5819251</last>\n<when>1152023684</when>\n<utime>07/04/06 05:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
