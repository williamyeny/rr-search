Go for one full hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not dip your needle in alcohol.  Flame sterilize the needle instead.  If you doubt this, simply dip a finger in alcohol, then make a fingerprint in a petri dish of agar.  Within three days, you'll see all sorts of nasty crap growing on the dish.  Alcohol is a very nice 'sanitizer' but it's horrible at 'sterilizing' which is what you need for mycology. Find a good medical website and do a few searches.  Compare 'sanitize' with 'sterilize'.  Alcohol is vastly over rated, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget, the inside of your needle gets contaminated with the normal air flow as well.  Flame sterilization until the needle is red hot will kill bad guys on the inside as well as the outside of the needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80 to 84 is way too hot to incubate grains.  Any temp over 80 will favor molds and bacteria and not mushroom mycelium.  One must bear in mind the mycelium produces heat as it grows.  If your jars are in an environment of 84F, the inside temp will be over 90F.  That reduces the growth of the mushroom mycelium and encourages bacteria.  Always incubate grain jars at room temperature.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4283006</next>\n<prev>4282463</prev>\n<first>4282185</first>\n<last>4283006</last>\n<when>1118503781</when>\n<utime>06/11/05 06:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
