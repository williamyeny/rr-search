The bacterial endospores will germinate in warm water much better than in cold.  I soak anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.  By 48 hours you can usually smell the grains fermenting, but they're still fine to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I give a five minute boil after the soak to kill the live bacteria.  That keeps the water from making your drain stink when you pour it down.  The boil also helps by making sure the grains are hot when you dump them in the strainer to drain.  If they're hot, surface moisture will evaporate off the surface of the grains, so they'll be dry on the outside when you load your jars.  All the moisture you'll need is in the interior of the grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4559077</next>\n<prev>4558785</prev>\n<first>4558785</first>\n<last>4561444</last>\n<when>1124562373</when>\n<utime>08/20/05 09:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
