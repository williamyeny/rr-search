{"key":"post-7840481","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7840481</id>\n<content>Temperature is not one of the major pinning triggers with tropical species, but I've seen very low temperatures cause uncolonized substrates to begin fruiting.  I think it may be part of the normal survival mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd watch the mycelium, and if it has stopped expanding, go ahead and open it up and wash off all the uncolonized parts with running water, and then place what's left into fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  I colonize all of my substrates in an open room exposed to ambient room light the whole time.  Pinning only begins when fruiting conditions are introduced, other than when something goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7840071</prev>\n<first>7839562</first>\n<last>7840481</last>\n<when>1199664737</when>\n<utime>01/07/08 02:12 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
