The few days faster colonization at 80 over 75 is, in my opinion not worth the hassles that getting too hot causes.  It seems every day there is another thread where somebody cooked their jars.  Is it really worth the risk to have jars finish in three weeks instead of three and a half to four weeks at normal room temperature?  I haven't used any sort of incubator in years.  If it's really cold in the room you grow in, just run a small space heater.  You'll be warmer too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5370397</next>\n<prev>5370351</prev>\n<first>5370342</first>\n<last>5370935</last>\n<when>1141667484</when>\n<utime>03/06/06 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
