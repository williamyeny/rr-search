There's far more of these posts, than posts from growers upset that their jars took an extra two or three days to colonize at room temperature.  Most of the growers that I've convinced to try room temperature will never go back.  If it's too cold in your house during the winter, just run a small space heater near the shelves the jars colonize on.  Any temperature in the mid 70's is fine for colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6081584</next>\n<prev>6081159</prev>\n<first>6080795</first>\n<last>6081584</last>\n<when>1158760701</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 04:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
