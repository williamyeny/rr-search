I think stacking two 1/2 pint cakes on top of each other per fahtsters teks produces better yields though.  Larger jars don't work as well because the substrate tends to pack down, making it hard for the mycelium to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6605085</next>\n<prev>6605076</prev>\n<first>6605076</first>\n<last>6605255</last>\n<when>1172334479</when>\n<utime>02/24/07 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
