Sterilization is never complete, which would take 24 hours or more and turn the grains to mush.  All we're doing with an hour or two of PC time is giving us a window of opportunity to get them colonized.  I'm sure some growers have been successful after waiting that long or longer, but in my opinion, why take the chance?  We're only talking a few cents worth of rye and some time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6690232</next>\n<prev>6690031</prev>\n<first>6690031</first>\n<last>6690262</last>\n<when>1174374093</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 10:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
