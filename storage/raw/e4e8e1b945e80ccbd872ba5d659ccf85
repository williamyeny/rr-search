Not &quot;lots.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything above 92-95% will cause problems. 100% humidity is absurdly high for fruiting. Mycelium grows in a moisture saturated environment when it is colonizing, it knows to fruit by two main triggers: exposure to light, and lower humidity - which means it has broken the surface of the substrate and its time to fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High humidity causes the mycelium to continue colonizing and consuming everything it finds, including its own fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest reading The Mushroom Cultivator by Stamets for some good background info on the life cycle of mushrooms. It covers humidity levels very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorrect, and TMC is chock full of outdated and incorrect information, most of which was corrected in GGMM.&amp;nbsp; TMC says to 'incubate at 86F, which is ten degrees too hot.&amp;nbsp; It says to incubate in total darkness, which delays pinning.&amp;nbsp; It gives the incorrect humidity as you stated above, and many other things that we now know more about than back in 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want near saturation humidity and massive air exchange.&amp;nbsp; A drop in humidity is not a pinning trigger, and light is a secondary pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; A loss of moisture from the substrate is the number one pinning trigger, and you can get a loss of moisture even at 99% humidity if your rate of air exchange is high enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mycelium growth over the caps is an indicator of stale, still air.&amp;nbsp; I think you're saying roughly the same thing, just in a different way.&amp;nbsp; If he'll increase fresh air exchange, the problem will rectify itself, even if he keeps a high humidity, which uncased substrate requires.&amp;nbsp; Primordia form in saturation humidity, so an uncased substrate requires near 100% humidity.&amp;nbsp; A cased substrate tends to hold a higher humidity right at the surface, thus it's more forgiving of improper attention to humidity control.&amp;nbsp; At any rate, fresh, moving, and turbulent air is what leads to the number ONE pinning trigger, which is evaporation of moisture from the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10314026</next>\n<prev>10313934</prev>\n<first>10312712</first>\n<last>10318178</last>\n<when>1241916371</when>\n<utime>05/10/09 03:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
