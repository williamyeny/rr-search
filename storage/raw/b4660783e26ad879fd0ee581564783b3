You want to be sure to elevate the jars out of the water when you sterilize.  They only need the steam, not the water.  Be sure to cover the tops with foil to keep the drips that fall off the lid from entering the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7082063</next>\n<prev>7081567</prev>\n<first>7081567</first>\n<last>7107457</last>\n<when>1182576410</when>\n<utime>06/23/07 08:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
