That's the way the guy is when he doesn't like someone. Like I said,I couldn't care less. I have a degree in the English Language ,thank you very much. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/grin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:grin:&quot; title=&quot;:grin:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bootster said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grammar includes punctuation. Your punctuation needs a bit of review. Maybe RR can chime in? I would think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I was going to simply ignore your 'English degree' fantasy, but you requested a chime in.&amp;nbsp; If one is going to attack others on grammar and punctuation, any non-retard would naturally want to check his own grammar, including proper use of the space bar, capital letters and punctuation, especially when he's making repeated 6th grade grammatical errors during the attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to quote you so that you can't change your error. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back on topic please.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15082076</next>\n<prev>15081830</prev>\n<first>15076938</first>\n<last>15229505</last>\n<when>1316100033</when>\n<utime>09/15/11 06:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
