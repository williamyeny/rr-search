Make the first transfers within a day or two after germination.  Transfer each and every growth to a new plate.  This way, the contaminations will all be on their own dishes, and the mushroom mycelium will also be isolated on its own plates.  Sometimes, it takes three or four transfers to get a pure culture, and then several more after that to isolate strains down to single sectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a couple of petri dish/agar teks in my DVD that would help you understand the process. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/1809563.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/18&lt;wbr&gt;09563.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7108703</prev>\n<first>7105442</first>\n<last>7109396</last>\n<when>1183180907</when>\n<utime>06/30/07 08:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
