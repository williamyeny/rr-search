If you give plenty of air exchange, the casing layer will be evaporating plenty of moisture that will have to be replenished by misting.  You don't want to lower it to 90% until the fruits are established, if even then.  I like to keep it high the whole cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is not that humidity for cased substrates needs to be lower than for cakes, it's that a cased substrate can tolerate a slightly lower humidity, but cakes NEED to be at 98% to 100% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6660049</next>\n<prev>6659683</prev>\n<first>6659523</first>\n<last>6666790</last>\n<when>1173672050</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 07:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
