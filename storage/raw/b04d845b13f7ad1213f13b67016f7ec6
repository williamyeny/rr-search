Use a flame sterilized blade.  You can probably skip the alcohol.  The air inside the bag should be still.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do similar when cloning wild mushrooms on backpacking trips.  I take several petri dishes sealed up in a baggie, a clear trash bag to use as a glovebox, and a scalpel and alcohol torch.  The scalpel is flamed outside the bag, then stuck in while still hot.
