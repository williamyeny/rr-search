{"key":"post-5846366","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5846366</id>\n<content>For the record, &lt;b&gt;THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT POTENCY IS SUBSTRATE RELATED.&lt;/b&gt;  Sorry for the caps, but the disinformation in this thread makes me want to scream.  What right do people who have only made a few grows have to make such a claim?  Do you see any old timers spouting such nonesense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some strains turn out to be bunk.  That is a fact.  By 'strain', I mean the isolate that you end up with from multispore inoculation, not some particular vendor named strain.  If a newbie grows on brf and gets a bunk strain, he tells everyone that brf is crap. If he grows again on horse manure and gets a good isolate, he tells everyone that horse manure rules.   Get a grip people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size and substrate material will affect the total yield of your crop. Some very experienced growers around here use nothing but brf cakes for one reason.  They work.  Personally, I prefer horse manure, but it's not for the potency, but the yield and ease.  If you use a substrate that provides basic food, your mycelium will do the rest.  If I see another brf sucks thread, I think I'll puke.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5846427</next>\n<prev>5846305</prev>\n<first>5841944</first>\n<last>5891443</last>\n<when>1152635449</when>\n<utime>07/11/06 07:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
