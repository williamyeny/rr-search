If they contaminate prior to fist flush, it means your spawn was contaminated. Save your lime for the casing, should you decide to use one.&amp;nbsp; My experience is that a casing layer isn't going to help that much.&amp;nbsp; Uncased coir and straw fruit great by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8606954</next>\n<prev>8606147</prev>\n<first>8602486</first>\n<last>8607733</last>\n<when>1215491333</when>\n<utime>07/08/08 07:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
