{"key":"post-7010135","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7010135</id>\n<content>It's not a popularity contest, and any method of growing that has proved itself worthy is not going to be bashed or flamed in this forum.  You won't achieve this harvest with 1 pint of manure.  Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-23/101746680-1_pint_pf_cake.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-23/101746680-thumb_1_pint_pf_cake.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of my grows are bulk substrates, usually sawdust/woodchips, or cased manure.  However, no substrate can match the biological effeciency of pf cakes. It's that simple.  If you're too mycologically challenged to pull it off, it speaks poorly of your abilities as a grower, but it's not the teks fault that you can't do what other growers have little trouble with.  End the bashing now.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7009972</prev>\n<first>7005740</first>\n<last>7010135</last>\n<when>1181017931</when>\n<utime>06/05/07 07:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
