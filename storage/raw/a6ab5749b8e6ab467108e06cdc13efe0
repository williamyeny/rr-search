Poke two or three nail size holes in the foil for &lt;i&gt;gas exchange.&lt;/i&gt; Micropore tape isn't necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condensation is normal.  It's caused by the temperature difference between inside and outside the tray.  Mycelium produces a lot of heat as it colonizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the learning curve is getting the substrate to field capacity before spawning.  The only way your substrate is too wet is if you made it that way.  When you pick up a tennis ball sized chunk of substrate or casing material, NO water should drip out.  If you squeeze gently, a drop or two will come out, and if you squeeze hard, a few drops will come out.   If you made it wetter than that, there lies the problem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6629623</next>\n<prev>6629546</prev>\n<first>6629546</first>\n<last>26790264</last>\n<when>1172893442</when>\n<utime>03/03/07 05:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
