Stems are very hollow and when I dehydrate they shrink pretty good. To me 20 grams dry doesn't seem to match up to a lot of peoples grows especially from 10 cakes. I do have a 2nd flush starting maybe my luck will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollow stems can be caused by genetics, but the most common cause is excessive temperature.&amp;nbsp; Keep your fruiting temps to 25C or below.&amp;nbsp; The next biggest factor is lighting, assuming your substrate moisture level is correct.&amp;nbsp; Give 12 hours of bright light in the 6500K color temperature spectrum, or bright light from a window with good sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12975798</next>\n<prev>12975144</prev>\n<first>12967753</first>\n<last>13069018</last>\n<when>1280471894</when>\n<utime>07/30/10 09:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
