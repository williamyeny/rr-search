I meant you need to give them 12 hours when fruiting comes.  Sorry if I abbreviated the post a bit.  I've typed it so many times it isn't even funny anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to leave the cakes to fruit as is, you can put them in a dark place for the last few days of colonization if you want, but it isn't necessary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main pinning triggers are full colonization, an increase in fresh air that comes with the decrease in CO2 levels, and a steady rate of evaporation from the substrate.  Once those conditions have been met, light becomes a secondary pinning trigger. A few minutes of light will work, but 12/12 has been shown to produce superior product.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5978540</next>\n<prev>5978491</prev>\n<first>5978112</first>\n<last>5979046</last>\n<when>1156016568</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
