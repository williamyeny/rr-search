That's why multispore inoculation works to a certain degree most of the time.  You'll want to isolate at least ten different rhizomorphic single sector isolates on agar, then fruit out each one.  It's common for me with ten isolates to have three or four that don't fruit at all, three or four that are mediocre fruiters, and one or two that deliver prolific flushes.  You have to hunt for that really great strain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4982238</next>\n<prev>4970201</prev>\n<first>4965871</first>\n<last>4982238</last>\n<when>1132997908</when>\n<utime>11/26/05 11:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
