{"key":"post-7928439","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7928439</id>\n<content>Fanning is when you take the lid of the tote and wave it back and forth over the terrarium to blow out the stale air and replace it with fresh.  Fan for fifteen seconds or so each time.   I'd suggest drilling a hundred or more 1/4&quot; holes into all six sides of the terrarium, elevate it an inch or two off the shelf, and then fan a couple of times per day also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mist each time you fan, just before fanning.  There is no maintenance free terrariums, so keep it simple and give your mushrooms lots of humidity, lots of fresh air, and lots of bright fluorescent light.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7929113</next>\n<prev>7928349</prev>\n<first>7926992</first>\n<last>7929936</last>\n<when>1201258648</when>\n<utime>01/25/08 12:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
