They're two different bad guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the trich is getting on you cakes or other substrates in the fruiting chamber, it's caused by improper air exchange.  If the trich is getting in your jars during colonization, it's caused most likely from your inoculation procedure.  Mold spores are killed by fairly low temperatures, so if you've sterilized your jars, you can be assured any mold has been killed.  Therefore, if mold shows up before birthing, it had to have been introduced post-sterilization. Where you soak the grains will have nothing to do with it, as you sterilize them later, and the air is already full of mold and bacterial spores anyway that are always going to be circulating around no matter how clean you are.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4559074</next>\n<prev>4559044</prev>\n<first>4558632</first>\n<last>4559079</last>\n<when>1124562784</when>\n<utime>08/20/05 09:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
