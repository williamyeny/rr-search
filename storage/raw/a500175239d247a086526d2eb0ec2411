It's a mineral, so has no contaminants other than what has landed on it in your house.  You'll be using it on a fully colonized substrate so no need for sterility.  If you insist on sterilizing it, a half hour on a cookie sheet in a 350F oven should do the trick.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6595077</next>\n<prev>6594862</prev>\n<first>6594081</first>\n<last>6619149</last>\n<when>1172107333</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 03:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
