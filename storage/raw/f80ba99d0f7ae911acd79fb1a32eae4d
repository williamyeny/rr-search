Soak the grains for 24 hours, boil for ten minutes, then drain into your strainers.  All the water will drip out within five minutes, then shake and toss the grain in the strainers so the steam can evaporate the surface moisture from the grains.  Toss the grains every five minutes for half an hour, then load jars.  The grains will be dry on the outside, but have plenty of moisture on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5121575</prev>\n<first>5121402</first>\n<last>5122075</last>\n<when>1135966835</when>\n<utime>12/30/05 08:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
