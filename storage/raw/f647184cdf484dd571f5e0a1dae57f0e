I beleive it's bacteria, because it doesn't happen when I make tea, or with dry mushies.  It only seems to happen really bad with fresh ones.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4011222</next>\n<prev>4009928</prev>\n<first>4008336</first>\n<last>4015927</last>\n<when>1112585937</when>\n<utime>04/04/05 06:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
