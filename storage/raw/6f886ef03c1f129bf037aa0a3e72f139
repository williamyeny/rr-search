Either drill holes in the tub, leave the lid loose, or fan a lot.  Personally, I wouldn't have flipped the cakes over, but don't undo it now. Leave them to grow.  Typically, the pins will form in the best place for them, which was on the bottom where they had more humidity and were protected from that fan.  Try to keep your humidity at 100% so they don't abort.  Always increase air exchange after misting, so the fruits don't ever stay wet for long.  Good luck and congrats on pins!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6951449</next>\n<prev>6951402</prev>\n<first>6951321</first>\n<last>6970059</last>\n<when>1179853437</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 08:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
