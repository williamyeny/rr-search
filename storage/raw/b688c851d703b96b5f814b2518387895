A humidifier inside the greenhouse works great, and mine last several times as long inside the greenhouse as outside.  Have it on a timer so it runs no more than two minutes at a time.  One minute on, six minutes off works great for me.  Just leave lots of gaps in the plastic so you have continuous air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5663411</next>\n<prev>5663209</prev>\n<first>5663140</first>\n<last>5664941</last>\n<when>1148392438</when>\n<utime>05/23/06 04:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
