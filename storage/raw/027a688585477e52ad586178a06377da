Try squeezing some water out of your coir that you adjusted three days earlier to 7, and test it.  It will be in the 5.5 to 6.5 range.  Bulls eye and others can adjust water, but asking it to adjust water AND a bulk substrate is too much.  Use calcium carbonate or hydrated lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6541712</next>\n<prev>6541601</prev>\n<first>6538754</first>\n<last>6543853</last>\n<when>1170899025</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 03:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
