{"key":"post-6382786","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6382786</id>\n<content>There is no consensus that running a humidifier inside a greenhouse will cause it to fail because it's untrue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the mist from a humidifier shoots upward, it only makes sense to put it on the bottom of the greenhouse so that the mist shoots up into the fruiting environment.  If you put it near the top, it would shoot into the walls or ceiling causing condensation and drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still stand by the advice to use a coolmist rather than an ultrasonic, but it's your choice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6383078</next>\n<prev>6382690</prev>\n<first>6376350</first>\n<last>6384707</last>\n<when>1166465354</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 08:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
