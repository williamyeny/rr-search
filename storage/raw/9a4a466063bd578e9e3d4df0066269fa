Bring the water to a boil and allow to boil for half an hour or so to make sure the water in the syringe has reached the boiling point.  When ready to work, remove the syringe, squirt out the water and use.  Flame sterilize the needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol is not a sterilizer and won't sterilize your syringe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5567563</next>\n<prev>5566496</prev>\n<first>5566132</first>\n<last>5567563</last>\n<when>1146241424</when>\n<utime>04/28/06 07:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
