The problem is that too many people are making posts here who don't understand the terminology and use the wrong words, thus confusing people who are trying to read the posts to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Casing' is not a word to use for a project.  When I see people post things like, &quot;I have two casings going right now&quot;, I want to scream.  The CASING is the non-nutritious top layer that is placed over a substrate to help induce pinning and to supply moisture to the substrate and the developing fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Bulk substrate&quot; is the term for using manure or coir, straw, worm castings, etc, to generate a larger project with higher yields.  Bulk substrates are spawned with grains or pf cakes.  They may be topped with a casing layer or left uncased, but they are still bulk substrates regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Spawn&quot; is the term for your colonized grains or pf cakes when you use them to inoculate a bulk substrate, or to simply layer them in a tray to add a casing layer over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you simply lay your colonized grains in a tray, then add a casing layer, your 'spawn' becomes your 'substrate' since that is what is supplying the nutrition for the fruits.  The grains are not however called a 'bulk' substrate in this application.   If you fruit pf cakes in a terrarium, the cakes are the 'substrate', but if you crumble them and mix with manure, the pf cakes become the 'spawn' used to inoculate a 'bulk substrate'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this clears things up.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if those who post would pay close attention to the nomenclature of mycology because it can get really confusing to new folks who are trying to learn.
