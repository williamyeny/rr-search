{"key":"post-5672233","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5672233</id>\n<content>I have 7 microscopes ranging from $175 to well over $5,000 each, but truth be known, the one I use the most in mycology is the $175 one.  It's a cheapie &lt;i&gt;stereo zoom microscope&lt;/i&gt;  It's the type that has the light and the objective on the same side.  It's for veiwing the tops of petri dishes or looking at sporeprints.  A &lt;i&gt;compound microscope&lt;/i&gt; is what you need for observing mycelium as it grows, and for looking for clamp connections.  A compound microscope has the light and the objective on opposite sides of the object you're viewing.  The light shines through the target and you see a transparancy of of your mycelium or spores.  Do a few searches using 'stereo zoom microsope' and 'compound microscope' and look for something in your price range.  The first picture below is of mycelium excreting metabolytes, taken with the $175 zoom microscope using a mini-div camera inserted in place of one of the eye tubes.   The second picture is of a single spore.  You can clearly see the internal components of the cell.  That picture was taken with a much more expensive medical grade trinocular compound microscope at 1000X with a 2 megapixel CCTV camera attached to the camera tube.  They're two totally different microscopes used for two different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-19/737380079-Metabolite_4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-19/737380079-thumb_Metabolite_4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-12/166572703-GT_1000X.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-12/166572703-thumb_GT_1000X.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12910314</next>\n<prev>5672142</prev>\n<first>5671249</first>\n<last>12910314</last>\n<when>1148575433</when>\n<utime>05/25/06 07:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
