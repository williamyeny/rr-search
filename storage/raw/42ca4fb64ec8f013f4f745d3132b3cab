There would be no water left in the grains, as it would have boiled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, take a look in your microwave.  If like mine, it's used on leftover pizza and chicken wings, it's nasty as hell inside.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8364204</next>\n<prev>8364091</prev>\n<first>8361588</first>\n<last>8573967</last>\n<when>1209995299</when>\n<utime>05/05/08 04:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
