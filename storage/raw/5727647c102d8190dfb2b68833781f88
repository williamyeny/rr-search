{"key":"post-5962066","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5962066</id>\n<content>Straw is usually colonized within a week to ten days.  However, you said above it's a 'casing'.  Straw is a bulk substrate, and you shouldn't apply a casing until it's fully colonized, if ever.  Straw fruits fine uncased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also don't sterilize straw, as it's a bulk substrate.  You only want to pasteurize it.  Sterile procedures are for spawn, such as uncolonized grains/brf.  Once the spawn is fully colonized, you need to be clean, but not sterile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5962148</next>\n<prev>5962016</prev>\n<first>5961710</first>\n<last>5962193</last>\n<when>1155567426</when>\n<utime>08/14/06 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
