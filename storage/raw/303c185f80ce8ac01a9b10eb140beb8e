Drywall literally is CaSO4 (calcium sulfate) or aka Gypsum. You could simply get some from Lowes or a local hardware store, its such crumbly stuff that most places which sell it should have some scraps laying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, for some of us, the nearest Lowes or Home Depot is a three to five hour drive. Yet, I can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenacresgypsum.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;80 pound bags of agricultural gypsum for $8&lt;/a&gt;, which is twice as much as you'll get in a sheet of drywall, for half the price. For serious growers, it's important to find out where the farmers get bulk minerals in your area. Buy wholesale, not retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link above works for those in Eastern Washington State, since it's in Spokane.&amp;nbsp; Find a similar business in your area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supermario420 said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi1099.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fg387%2FRollingStarz1%2FWood%2F36472_4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn't Tyvek, and if you try to wear that worthless shit while sweeping a floor, you'll sweat like a pig.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15313331</next>\n<prev>15294400</prev>\n<first>15252915</first>\n<last>15313698</last>\n<when>1319900265</when>\n<utime>10/29/11 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
