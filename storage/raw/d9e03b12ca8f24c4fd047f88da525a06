I would NEVER recommend using a shotgun type terrarium as a monotub.  I would never recommend doing any of the things you did wrong that have all been pointed out above by others. Quit blaming those who would help, if you would only listen.  Before you call anyone else an idiot, post a few awesome grows so you at least have a leg to stand on.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8034557</next>\n<prev>8034492</prev>\n<first>8031890</first>\n<last>8036014</last>\n<when>1203276778</when>\n<utime>02/17/08 09:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
