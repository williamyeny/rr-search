Horse manure is a substrate ingredient, not a casing material.  You don't want the casing to be more than 3/4&quot; with cubensis or it wastes too much time and energy trying to colonize it.  Further, a casing should be non-nutritious, so it signals the substrate below that it is running out of food and to start pinning.  The non-nutritious casing layer also should not fully colonize so you can mist the top layer and it will absorb the moisture and transfer it to the substrate below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horse manure makes an excellent substrate, but a horrible casing.  What did you use for a substrate and spawn?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6213467</prev>\n<first>6209150</first>\n<last>6213690</last>\n<when>1161881827</when>\n<utime>10/26/06 07:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
