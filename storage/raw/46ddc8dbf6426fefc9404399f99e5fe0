I seen it myself man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullshit.  You saw nothing of the kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the commercial button mushrooms sold in grocery stores grow from substrates with trichoderma. There is no requirement from the FDA to get rid of them, or even a suggestion to. Green molds are not toxic to healthy humans, period.  Don't breathe the spores, but mushrooms harvested from a cake with a spot of trichoderma or penicillium on the opposite side will not hurt you in any way.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting the cake outside in a manure bed is the best answer, providing it's warm enough in your area.  You don't want those spores floating around your grow room, contaminating future grows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8339794</next>\n<prev>8339612</prev>\n<first>8332934</first>\n<last>8342774</last>\n<when>1209441541</when>\n<utime>04/29/08 06:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
