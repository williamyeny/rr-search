It took a few deaths of children in house fires for the NFPA to put the ban on them into the electrical code.  For years they figured common sense would prevent electricians from hooking them up, and that's true, but often people do their own wiring without the qualifications.  Of course, those people don't read the electrical code anyway, but having it in the National Electrical Code allows local authorities to charge them with manslaughter if anyone dies in the fire they cause.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6775654</next>\n<prev>6775547</prev>\n<first>6773994</first>\n<last>6778092</last>\n<when>1176326473</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 12:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
