You won't get much movement or turbulence from an aquarium pump feeding an airstone.&amp;nbsp; They work better than nothing at all, but there's better ways of doing things.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10462413</next>\n<prev>10462375</prev>\n<first>10459904</first>\n<last>10485500</last>\n<when>1244332719</when>\n<utime>06/07/09 02:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
