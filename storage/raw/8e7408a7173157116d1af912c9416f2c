Your long twisted stems and small caps are the sure sign that you have high CO2 levels.  That's a worse problem than side-pinning, which usually doesn't effect total yield that much.(side mushrooms are usually larger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side pinning is caused by that area being the best place to pin.  Mycelium pins in 99% to 100% humidity.  If your casing layer isn't moist or loose and airy enough to provide 100% at the surface of the substrate, the pins will form where those conditions exist, which is around the edges where the substrate has pulled in from the sides slightly, providing a perfect micro-environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick those fruits, then don't mist, dunk, or anything else for at least five days.  After the 'rest' period, either soak your substrate in water for several hours, or mist every hour or two for a few days to rehydrate the substrate for the next flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend that you wrap the sides and bottom of that container with black tape to absorb light and keep it off the mycelium.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7546042</next>\n<prev>7545979</prev>\n<first>7545684</first>\n<last>16164735</last>\n<when>1193063746</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
