The holes help to prevent huge CO2 buildups, but you'll still want to fan whenever you think of it.  Provided the other pinning triggers are met, fresh air exchange is extremely important for a good pinset.  Along with lots of fresh air, comes a tendency for the substrate to dry out, and this moisture must be replaced by misting.
