The OP doesn't have a properly built shotgun terrarium because there isn't enough holes, and it's sitting on a table rather than up on blocks so air can enter from under the perlite where it's engineered to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, humidity is only a secondary concern and easily made up for with extra misting.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, and this point is missed by almost all new growers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15538940</next>\n<prev>15538923</prev>\n<first>15538515</first>\n<last>15542580</last>\n<when>1324310987</when>\n<utime>12/19/11 06:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
