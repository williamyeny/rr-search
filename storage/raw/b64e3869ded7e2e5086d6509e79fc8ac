You don't want to do it in the kitchen.  There's more molds and bacteria in the kitchen than any other room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bic lighter is fine.  A butane type lighter is hotter and won't leave carbon on the needle, but as long as you get it red hot it's fine.  Allow to cool for 2 seconds and use.  The needle will still be hot, but not red hot, and the first half drop of solution will cool it off safely, allowing the rest to flow cleanly.  Use a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7548380</prev>\n<first>7548346</first>\n<last>7549054</last>\n<when>1193108944</when>\n<utime>10/23/07 06:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
