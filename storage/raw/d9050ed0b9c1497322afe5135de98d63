That's why we banned so called strain discussion to the unmoderated 'strain thread' at the top of mushroom cultivation.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>18883716</prev>\n<first>18882467</first>\n<last>18883988</last>\n<when>1380028286</when>\n<utime>09/24/13 04:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
