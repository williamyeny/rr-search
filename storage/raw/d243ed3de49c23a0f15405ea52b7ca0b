I thought this was normal practise. If it doesn't harm reptiles why would it be of negative value to a FC set-up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've typed that answer at least 1000 times over the last few years.&amp;nbsp; I can't keep typing it again and again because people don't want to use the search function for their answers.&amp;nbsp; Search posts for &lt;i&gt;terrarium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;heating pad&lt;/i&gt;, using my name as the filter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;ecotopia said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surfaces have been covered in tiny little drops from day one in the chamber but the humidity levels have fluctuated between 80%-100% and based on those fluctuations I've misted when it's dropped but I guess I didn't account for temperature drops too. There may be plenty of moisture in the tub but not enough heat to make it airborne and therefore I've overwatered. Wouldn't you say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes absolutely no sense.&amp;nbsp; If there are tiny water droplets on the cakes at all times, your humidity is already at or near 100%.&amp;nbsp; If not, the water droplets would evaporate.&amp;nbsp; If you have a made in china 'hygrometer', take a hammer and smash it to bits so you won't be tempted to look at your wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your statement about having enough moisture but not enough heat to make it airborne makes no sense either.&amp;nbsp; Heat will lower humidity, not raise it.&amp;nbsp; This is why when it's cold and raining outdoors, it's 100% humidity.&amp;nbsp; A 20F/15C rise in temperature will cut relative humidity in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruising can be caused by too dry or too wet a substrate.&amp;nbsp; Simply pick up your cakes so you can judge from the weight which it is based on how much they weighed before fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19485051</next>\n<prev>19484804</prev>\n<first>19480016</first>\n<last>19492963</last>\n<when>1390912034</when>\n<utime>01/28/14 02:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
