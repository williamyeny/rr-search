{"key":"post-13224641","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>13224641</id>\n<content>I noticed in the mountains of the PNW that oyster mushrooms, Reishi, and Lion's mane, etc., would fruit from the same above-ground downed trees every year, and then these trees would freeze solid all winter.&amp;nbsp; In the spring they'd recover and fruit.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the PNW summers are very dry, with no rain generally from May until September.&amp;nbsp; The same trees would dry totally out and snap like matchsticks, but sure enough, when the fall rains came, the mycelium would again recover and fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above led me to start putting wood in culture slants&amp;nbsp; back in about 1997 or so, and I've noticed it extends the life of the cultures exponentially.&amp;nbsp; Lately, I've noticed nearly every culture vendor has started using wood in their slants.&amp;nbsp; If you take a tissue sample from the agar on a slant with wood and it doesn't take off, reach in and grab the piece of wood itself.&amp;nbsp; It's almost a guarantee that the mycelium in the wood will revive and take off once placed on agar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not about nutrients.&amp;nbsp; The agar mix is far more nutritious than the wood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13224785</next>\n<prev>13224530</prev>\n<first>13224156</first>\n<last>13225128</last>\n<when>1285044052</when>\n<utime>09/21/10 07:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
