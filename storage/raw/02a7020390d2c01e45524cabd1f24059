Toss in about 10% gypsum too, just like with all substrates.&amp;nbsp; Bagged cow manure works great, but it can get pretty muddy if you don't mix with verm.&amp;nbsp; Brand is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; What matters is where each batch comes from. If from a feedlot or dairy, it's going to be a lot muddier than if from a ranch where they're eating hay.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10106163</next>\n<prev>10106018</prev>\n<first>10105596</first>\n<last>16518130</last>\n<when>1238883930</when>\n<utime>04/05/09 01:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
