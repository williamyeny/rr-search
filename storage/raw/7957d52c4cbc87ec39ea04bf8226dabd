The part that is fruiting is not contaminated and nothing will be wrong with the fruits.  The other part as said above has a reason not to be colonized, but it might be as simple as too wet or too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much air exchange during colonization leads to early pinning too.  If the holes in your jar lid are too big, your grains or whatever are exposed to air exchange rather than just gas exchange, which would keep CO2 levels high and prevent pinning.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6255487</next>\n<prev>6255321</prev>\n<first>6254860</first>\n<last>6260887</last>\n<when>1162871403</when>\n<utime>11/07/06 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
