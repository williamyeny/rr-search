There's nothing synthetic about cellulose it's actually quite organic hence it attracting mold since probably half of the kingdom of fungi specializes in metabolizing the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid(1950s) in the age before saran wrap, we had cellophane to wrap stuff up in.
