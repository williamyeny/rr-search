That would completely contradict the Wax Paper method and The straw log method.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post a link of information backing this suggestion up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaporation of moisture from the substrate is the number ONE pinning trigger and has been since day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax paper helps to hold a high humidity right at the surface, while you provide for massive fresh air.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to wrinkle the wax paper into a ball, and then flatten it back out again for use.&amp;nbsp; This allows all sorts of passageways for air to pass.&amp;nbsp; Straw logs pin when you unwrap the plastic, which results in a massive moisture loss, thus pins form by the thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're saturating your substrate, that's the reason pinning is poor.&amp;nbsp; You want to mist, and then allow that moisture to evaporate and the substrate to begin to dry before misting again.&amp;nbsp; You really can't automate this well.&amp;nbsp; It takes eyeballs to get it right.&amp;nbsp; With years of experience, you'll be able to dial in a timer to get close, but you still have to watch what's going on and adjust accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9989326</prev>\n<first>9917613</first>\n<last>9989957</last>\n<when>1237329496</when>\n<utime>03/18/09 01:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
