{"key":"post-5190240","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5190240</id>\n<content>There is no need to PC a syringe.  We use the PC to kill bacterial endospores in grains.  Live bacteria is killed by simple boiling.  Molds such as trichoderma and penicillin are easily killed by temps far below boiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll simply drop your syringe into a pot of boiling water for ten minutes, it will be good to use.  Suck up a bit of the boiling water into the syringe, swirl it around and squirt it out.  Do this a couple of times, then use.  As stated above, use distilled water (after boiling) to mix your spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5190442</next>\n<prev>5187085</prev>\n<first>5180478</first>\n<last>5190442</last>\n<when>1137508360</when>\n<utime>01/17/06 04:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
