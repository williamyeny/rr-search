{"key":"post-6014760","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6014760</id>\n<content>Coir or straw will both perform well as bulk substrates, and you can mix coffee grinds right in.  You can also mix straw and coir together.  Don't add coffee to any casing.  The casing should be non-nutritious.  You can fruit uncased or case with peat/verm.   Adding another layer of coir would simply be adding another layer of substrate, which you would then have to wait to colonize, delaying your crop.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6014700</prev>\n<first>6014700</first>\n<last>6014760</last>\n<when>1157032659</when>\n<utime>08/31/06 04:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
