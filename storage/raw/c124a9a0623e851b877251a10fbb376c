Put the manure in the bottom of the tray first, and then sprinkle the grains on top, and gently vibrate the tray so the grains settle into the substrate.  Top off with a thin layer of compost or manure to ensure no grains are left exposed on the surface.  With thick substrates, this process should be repeated in layers.  Remember, don't leave exposed grains on the very top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6979001</next>\n<prev>6978694</prev>\n<first>6978639</first>\n<last>6979322</last>\n<when>1180399604</when>\n<utime>05/29/07 03:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
