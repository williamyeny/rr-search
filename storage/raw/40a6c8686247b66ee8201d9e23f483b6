In a quart jar, the ratio is nearly 1 to 1.   In a spawn bag holding 15 quarts, the ratio would be closer to 1.5 to 1.(rye to water)  You'll have to experiment.   Personally, I don't like spawn bags for grains.  I still use jars, and save the bags for sawdust/chips.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6441495</next>\n<prev>6441447</prev>\n<first>6441447</first>\n<last>6450505</last>\n<when>1168368755</when>\n<utime>01/09/07 08:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
