They aren't plants.&amp;nbsp; :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cringe when I see mushy growers using HPS or MH lights though. Or spending any additional money on obtaining special lights.&amp;nbsp; Any light works as long as it is not too hot.&amp;nbsp; Mushies tend to prefer shaded growth even in the wild.&amp;nbsp; No need to mimic the sun. Just a lil light will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just flat-out wrong, and not based on fact other than the part about mushrooms not being plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not even a controversy.&amp;nbsp; Too many mushroom farms have put in bright LED strings or 6500K fluorescent lamps after reading about work done at Mountain Mushroom Farm. Fungi Perfecti also now &lt;i&gt;colonizes and fruits&lt;/i&gt; substrates exposed to 6500K light for 12 hours per day from start to finish. All have reported increases in yield far beyond the costs of the lights or electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I ran some tests several years ago with 400 watt MH lamps with a color temperature of 4500K.&amp;nbsp; Yields were well above what was achieved with fluorescent lamps.&amp;nbsp; More research is needed to find the upper limit of effectiveness as far as brightness is concerned.&amp;nbsp; Full spectrum works better than any individual frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've said for years, some mushrooms will grow in total darkness, just not well.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, since most of the members around here have never grown anything but cubes, it should be noted they rarely grow in the shade.&amp;nbsp; I've picked thousands of pounds of wild cubes from the very middle of cow pastures in Texas without anything but a few blades of grass for shade.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18879797</next>\n<prev>18879207</prev>\n<first>18874915</first>\n<last>18888250</last>\n<when>1379940756</when>\n<utime>09/23/13 03:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
