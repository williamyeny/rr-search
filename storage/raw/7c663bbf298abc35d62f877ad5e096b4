That means post sterilization on your jars, and the entire inoculation process. Use masks, gloves, hairnets, and alcohol to wash the gloves and needles prior to flame sterilization.  Use Oust to control bacteria in the air.  Build a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the mycelium has been spawned into bulk substrates, it is less important, but you must still be clean.  Bulk substrates are pasteurized, not sterilized, so organisms are always present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When projects are in the fruiting chamber, you also want to keep things clean, but sterility is unimportant.  Don't use lysol near fruiting chambers as it's been linked to aborts and mutations.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6393195</prev>\n<first>6393195</first>\n<last>6393515</last>\n<when>1166721806</when>\n<utime>12/21/06 07:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
