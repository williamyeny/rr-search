I've seen damp bags of pure vermiculite with cobweb mold covering the entire surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By baking the verm before use, you kill off the billions of unwanted fungi and other contaminants which have settled on it since it left the furnaces at the manufacturing plant.&amp;nbsp; Of course, whatever lands on the verm after baking and before harvest will have a chance to grow, but the idea is to reduce the spore load before using so the mushroom mycelium has a window of opportunity to fruit before trichoderma or other molds take hold of the damp verm and grow instead.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18924903</next>\n<prev>18924834</prev>\n<first>18916441</first>\n<last>18924903</last>\n<when>1380809222</when>\n<utime>10/03/13 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
