Make sure you remove the foil immediately after removing the jars from the pressure cooker.  This will allow the filters to dry out and do their job.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've used tyvek coveralls for filter material many times.  I doubt that's your problem.  Tyvek is used for safety coveralls because it allows the person's sweat vapor to escape, while still providing protection from the toxins.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6455940</next>\n<prev>6455429</prev>\n<first>6455213</first>\n<last>6457306</last>\n<when>1168718125</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 09:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
