Cloning these does not insure you'll get large fruits next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, large fruits are not desirable.  Smaller fruits have more active product per gram than larger ones, so try to produce larger flushes of smaller fruits.  When cloning, select a young, rapidly growing fruit for best results.  You want a fruit that is rapidly dividing cells, so it will take off quickly on agar.  I prefer to clone from clusters, because they'll tend to produce clusters on future flushes, giving the volume desired, but with smaller and more desirable fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7795073</next>\n<prev>7794363</prev>\n<first>7793936</first>\n<last>7829335</last>\n<when>1198506503</when>\n<utime>12/24/07 04:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
