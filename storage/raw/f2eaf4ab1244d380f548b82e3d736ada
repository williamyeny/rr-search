A sheet of waxpaper layed over the tray will help maintain the microclimate in that spot.  Once the pins turn into small mushrooms, 70% to 80% is fine.   If the humidity is a bit low, the caps will crack on top, but it does no harm.  In fact, shiitake growers deliberately lower humidity to crack the caps.  It's considered to make the fruits better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal indoor temperatures work fine for cubes.  I've seen them fruit, and fruit well from the uppper 50's through the mid 90's.  The mid 70's are considered ideal, but don't stress out trying to maintain that if conditions in your area change.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5981055</prev>\n<first>5980112</first>\n<last>5981071</last>\n<when>1156088362</when>\n<utime>08/20/06 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
