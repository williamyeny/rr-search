I didn't want to recommend recycling old newspapers and phonebooks, junk mail, etc., into mushrooms if there was the risk of heavy metals contamination from the inks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray in my picture had holes burned through prior to first flush, a period of only a few weeks.  Aside from the aluminum contamination referenced/debunked above, the biggest problem could be the premature pinning caused by holes on the bottom of the tray.  Bottom line:  Find a different tray material for growing mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7859803</next>\n<prev>7858122</prev>\n<first>7855394</first>\n<last>7860313</last>\n<when>1199981134</when>\n<utime>01/10/08 06:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
