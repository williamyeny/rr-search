Eating the same food doesn't cause senescence, cell divisions do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When working with wild prints, I'll often use antibiotic agar, and mix it with less malt.  If you buy pre-mixed agar powder from fp or sporeworks, you can mix it a bit weaker than recommended.  This will keep from feeding the mold and bacteria quite so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the video back, watch the section on strain isolation.  It demonstrates the best places to take transfers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7903360</next>\n<prev>7903232</prev>\n<first>7902193</first>\n<last>7903360</last>\n<when>1200797888</when>\n<utime>01/20/08 04:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
