If the temperature and dewpoint are equal at the surface of the earth, fog forms.&amp;nbsp; If the dewpoint and temperature are equal at 5000 feet elevation, clouds form at 5000 feet. &lt;b&gt;Moist air is lighter than dry air&lt;/b&gt;, whether you are capable of understanding this basic concept or not.&amp;nbsp; Your failure to understand simple physics does not render the science invalid unless you wish to make a point that adam and eve rode around on dinosaurs and praised jesus while they wrote the bible, in which case no further explanation is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you don't argue science with scientists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to google.com and type, &quot;moist air lighter than dry air&quot; or something similar and look at the 500,000 or so hits you get to see where you're so off base on this.&amp;nbsp; I've typed the detailed answer so many dozens and dozens of times that my fingers hurt, and I won't be typing it again for those too lazy to search for such simple stuff the rest of us learned as kids.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17194625</prev>\n<first>17189242</first>\n<last>17194829</last>\n<when>1352565873</when>\n<utime>11/10/12 06:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
