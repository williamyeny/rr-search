They also have single and two section. Some dishes have external vents.  You don't need those.  The lids on regualar petri dishes just sit in place without sealing, so they work fine.  Don't forget to wrap with parafilm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7091329</prev>\n<first>7091329</first>\n<last>7091432</last>\n<when>1182809958</when>\n<utime>06/26/07 01:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
