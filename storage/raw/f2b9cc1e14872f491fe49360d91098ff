Yours should have blown before the gauge read 30 lbs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should always be at least two means of overpressure control in the event that one of them fails. My 55 gallon drum boiler has three means of overpressure control for added safety.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19345710</next>\n<prev>19345693</prev>\n<first>19342794</first>\n<last>19347569</last>\n<when>1388423768</when>\n<utime>12/30/13 07:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
