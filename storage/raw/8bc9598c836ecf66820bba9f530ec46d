What you want for successful mycology is a &lt;i&gt;laminar flow&lt;/i&gt; hepa filter.  Without laminar flow, you're just swirling the air around, which will pick up contaminants and blow them into your work.  By working in front of a laminar air stream, the air, thus contaminants, leave the area of your work, flowing back towards you and away from the sterile media.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7534774</next>\n<prev>7534765</prev>\n<first>7534684</first>\n<last>7534834</last>\n<when>1192810976</when>\n<utime>10/19/07 07:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
