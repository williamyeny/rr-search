I will be using a cool mist humidifier to keep humidity high instead of misting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also be using a 6500K light as the main source of lighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In six days no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you don't mist for humidity, so running a humidifier won't help.&amp;nbsp; Perlite is for humidity and misting is to replace the moisture lost by the substrate as the cakes dry out and the mushrooms grow.&amp;nbsp; Since mushrooms are 90% water, that's a LOT of water and the mushrooms can't pull it all out of thin air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15271779</prev>\n<first>15271569</first>\n<last>15271797</last>\n<when>1319492199</when>\n<utime>10/25/11 12:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
