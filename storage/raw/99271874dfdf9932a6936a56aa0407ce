Petroleum based solvents such as WD-40 can cause problems, but not the fat stem/tiny caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation is not an indication of humidity level.&amp;nbsp; Condensation indicates a temperature differential across the surface. Fat stems and tiny caps seem to be genetic in nature, but are sometimes caused by insufficient light and/or birthing too soon.&amp;nbsp; It's best to wait a week after full colonization before birthing the cakes or other substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10656958</next>\n<prev>10656950</prev>\n<first>10656804</first>\n<last>10658429</last>\n<when>1247323472</when>\n<utime>07/11/09 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
