Information to lower humidity after pins set is incorrect. Fruit size is related to moisture content, so I'd suggest dunking the cakes overnight even with the pins on them.  Pins usually survive the dunk and sometimes even double in size during the overnight dunk.  Work to get your humidity as high as possible.  Make sure there is no standing water in the perlite, because that lowers humidity.  Don't forget to give plenty of air exchange as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6699393</next>\n<prev>6699291</prev>\n<first>6699291</first>\n<last>6699393</last>\n<when>1174591411</when>\n<utime>03/22/07 10:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
