Tape them up until fruiting time to keep the CO2 levels high. Don't worry about putting a bag over it.&amp;nbsp; There is no benefit to keeping colonizing mycelium in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10136405</next>\n<prev>10136303</prev>\n<first>10135832</first>\n<last>10136428</last>\n<when>1239304817</when>\n<utime>04/09/09 10:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
