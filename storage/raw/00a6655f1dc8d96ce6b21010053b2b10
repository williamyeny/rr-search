It was taking fully colonized coir about to be on its 3 rd flush here soon finishong up second here soon, and putting chunks into new coir. Then putting that into colonize. No need to i have 10 quarts of wbs colonizing as we speak. Again just a question i thought would be good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason is that by the time it's flushed, the substrate is covered in contaminant spores, some of which have already germinated and begun to grow.&amp;nbsp; If you spawn this to freshly pasteurized substrate, the molds will outgrow the mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason is that the mycelium is old and tired.&amp;nbsp; After a few flushes, they don't stop producing due to running out of nutrients, but rather because the mycelium has produced fruits and reached the end of it's natural life cycle.&amp;nbsp; Giving this old mycelium a fresh substrate would be like giving an old man a steak dinner.&amp;nbsp; It's not going to make him young and virile again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>21021929</next>\n<prev>13674122</prev>\n<first>13668985</first>\n<last>21063845</last>\n<when>1293109699</when>\n<utime>12/23/10 03:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
