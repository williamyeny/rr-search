Obviously on overcast days I have the curtains and blinds thrown wide, but is real direct sunlight too intense? On those really bright days, would blinds open but curtains drawn provide a nice level of ambient light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very bright window usually enough in the summer months when days are long.&amp;nbsp; During the winter, when days are much shorter, supplement with fluorescent lighting in the daylight(6500K) range.&amp;nbsp; If you draw the curtains to keep your house cool, use the fluorescent lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minutes of direct sunlight per day is great.&amp;nbsp; More than that and it can tend to dry out your cakes or other substrates, but a few minutes is a wonderful pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for manure, coffee grinds, etc., simply say it's for your garden.&amp;nbsp; That's a good enough answer and all that's required.&amp;nbsp; When I lived in a condo in Seattle, I walked right up to the mounted police department stables and walked away with a large bag of horse manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12947504</next>\n<prev>12944465</prev>\n<first>12940016</first>\n<last>12947504</last>\n<when>1279981577</when>\n<utime>07/24/10 05:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
