Of that, it's easy to draw at least 100ml back out, filling ten syringes from each quart.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe fahtsters tek used pf type jars, but done without a verm barrier.&amp;nbsp; It seems he used tyvek or micropore tape, which allows you to shake easier when you add the water.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8652277</next>\n<prev>8651975</prev>\n<first>8648039</first>\n<last>8662193</last>\n<when>1216423546</when>\n<utime>07/19/08 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
