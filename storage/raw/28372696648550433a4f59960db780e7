I don't see any of the orange color except where it's up against the glass.  Perhaps it's not contaminated at all. . .yet.  What's in that jar?  I see extra large verm.  What's the rest?  Also, that jar is 100% full.  That won't allow you to shake, and it also is going to get whatever filter material you use wet, which will allow contaminants to colonize through the interior of your filter material.  You shouldn't fill quart or liter jars more than 2/3 to 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5683402</next>\n<prev>5683178</prev>\n<first>5683178</first>\n<last>5707011</last>\n<when>1148840396</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 09:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
