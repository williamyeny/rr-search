You want perlite, not verm.  You also don't want to seal your lid tight.  Fresh air exchange is required for pinning.  You want about two inches of damp, not wet perlite in the bottom of the container.  After that, you can leave the lid crooked a bit so air can flow in and out.   Just use tap water to dunk your cakes.  I see no reason for h002.  Wash the cakes under your faucet, then dunk in a container of water overnight.  Put ice in the container to prevent bacterial blooms or place in the refrigerator.  Rinse again after the dunk and place back in the fruiting chamber.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5685541</next>\n<prev>5682469</prev>\n<first>5679772</first>\n<last>5685891</last>\n<when>1148816961</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 02:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
