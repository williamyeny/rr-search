We lime our casing layers to a basic pH of around 8 to 8.5 to help prevent molds.&amp;nbsp; We leave our substrates at the natural pH of the substrate material, which in most cases is fairly acidic.&amp;nbsp; Gypsum is often added to help prevent wild swings in pH due to the acidic qualities of mushroom metabolites, and to supply calcium and sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please continue to study and learn.&amp;nbsp; Thanks. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8855571</next>\n<prev>8855112</prev>\n<first>8853832</first>\n<last>8860737</last>\n<when>1220192766</when>\n<utime>08/31/08 05:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
