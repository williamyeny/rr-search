We don't adjust PH for the mushroom mycelium.   Mushrooms will grow very well in a substrate/casing with a PH of 5.  Unfortunately, molds such as Trichoderma also thrive in an acidic PH environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium however is much more tolerant of a high PH level, and will still thrive in a PH of 8, which is ten times more alkaline than a PH of 7, but the contaminant molds don't grow nearly as well with a high PH level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I've been growing a lot of edible/medicinal mushrooms and many of them will not fruit from a pasteurized or sterilized casing layer, so the peat-verm has been going right on the substrate with no heat treatment at all.  If you case this way you certainly better lime it or you'll see green by the time of the first flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5988869</next>\n<prev>5988439</prev>\n<first>5985046</first>\n<last>6415198</last>\n<when>1156322735</when>\n<utime>08/23/06 11:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
