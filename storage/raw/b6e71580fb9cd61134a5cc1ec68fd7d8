(260 X 4 square feet) If you select that filter, I'd go with a smaller blower and get a motor speed controller so you can throttle it down if necessary.&amp;nbsp; Look for around 800 CFM @ 1&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10584168</next>\n<prev>10583952</prev>\n<first>10541933</first>\n<last>10631608</last>\n<when>1246167028</when>\n<utime>06/28/09 08:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
