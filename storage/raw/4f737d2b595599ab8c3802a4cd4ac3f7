In addition, those cheap department store hepa filters do nothing for mycology.  I have a storage shed full of them.  They flow way too much air, they let way too much contaminants through, they leak around the edges, and most importantly, they don't produce laminar flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a &lt;i&gt;laminar flow&lt;/i&gt; hood, or a still air glovebox.  Lots of new growers try all sorts of hepa filter/fan combos on their gloveboxes, but after a few months, they've removed them and sealed up the holes, because a glovebox works best with &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7781203</next>\n<prev>7780982</prev>\n<first>7780708</first>\n<last>7784546</last>\n<when>1198171219</when>\n<utime>12/20/07 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
