{"key":"post-6382540","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6382540</id>\n<content>I've ran several tests with the microscopes to determine spore viability.  A brand new print will give about 1 spore in 100 that will germinate.  After two weeks, that drops to about 1 spore in 500.  At one month since taking the print, less than 1 spore in 1000 will germinate, and after one year, you're doing good to get 1 spore in 10,000 that is still viable and it drops even faster after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing to remember is take clean prints and store them properly.  An old print will still work, but remember that you'll need to use many more spores to get the few that will germinate.  Remember, when you use more spores, you also risk using more contaminant spores that may be hitch hiking along for the ride.   Thus, fresh prints are better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382605</next>\n<prev>6381974</prev>\n<first>6381741</first>\n<last>6382605</last>\n<when>1166459145</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
