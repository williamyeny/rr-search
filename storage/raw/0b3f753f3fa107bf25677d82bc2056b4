You can isolate enough strains off a single sporeprint of ANY strain to match the diversity you'll get from multispore grows of all hundred 'named' strains in circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, a strain by definition is a pairing of two compatible hyphae into dikaryotic mycelium.  The location the original print was taken from has no more to do with the size and shape of the fruits than being a human from New York or New Jersey or England has to do with how tall or how smart you are.  Remember, cubes are all the same species, just like we humans are all the same species.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6322239</next>\n<prev>6322132</prev>\n<first>6317897</first>\n<last>6327784</last>\n<when>1164932883</when>\n<utime>12/01/06 02:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
