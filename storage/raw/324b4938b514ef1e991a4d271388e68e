Since truffles are a “living” product, it can happen that a white mist or white fluff “grows” on the truffles . This is harmless, and in fact it is actually healthy. The truffle forms new mycelium, and thus it is its own fungus that you see growing. This phenomenon occurs due to lack of gas exchange, which lets the CO2 content in the container increase. &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fluff you see growing is from keeping them too wet.&amp;nbsp; Sclerotia will absorb water, and this water is teeming with bacteria, even when chlorinated.&amp;nbsp; Since the only way to properly store them is in their dry form(as millions of years of evolution has designed), you want to get them dry as soon as possible to stop the degradation of the alkaloids.&amp;nbsp; If you put them in the refrigerator in a brown paper bag, they'll dry within a few days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grains they grow on can be picked off easily when you harvest, or brushed off with a clean basting brush.&amp;nbsp; Besides, grains are tasty so there is no need to get it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; off.&amp;nbsp; Sorry to be short earlier, but considering that I've typed the same answer many times in the past, it's hard to keep doing it over and over again.&amp;nbsp; Just because some farm in Netherlands washes them, doesn't make it right.&amp;nbsp; There's farms in the US that wrap fresh mushrooms in plastic for sale in grocery stores, which is equally bad for product quality.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully people here don't also start recommending to wrap fresh mushrooms in plastic. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has bitten into a rancid sclerotia knows exactly what I'm talking about. It's like picking up a wet rag from behind the gas station toilet and sticking it in your mouth. The key is to eat them fresh, or get them dry as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17067705</next>\n<prev>17066886</prev>\n<first>17064561</first>\n<last>17067705</last>\n<when>1350756113</when>\n<utime>10/20/12 09:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
