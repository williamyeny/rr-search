The grains need to be dry when you load the jars.  The moisture you need is inside the kernel, not outside on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are using foil over the lids aren't you?  The lid of a PC rains water back down on the jars during the whole PC cycle due to the difference in temperature between the outside of the PC and inside.  The jars have to be covered with foil or that rainwater slips right past the filter and through the holes into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6546207</next>\n<prev>6545476</prev>\n<first>6544398</first>\n<last>6546896</last>\n<when>1170991651</when>\n<utime>02/09/07 05:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
