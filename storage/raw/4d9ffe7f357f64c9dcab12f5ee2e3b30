These were jars I started before I moved to my cabin, and didn't have time to start any projects last summer, so they sat in the barn/carport for 10 months. The mycelium began growing again as soon as they were brought inside.&amp;nbsp; I've already fruited a couple of those jars, thus -30F is very survivable if they're on rye grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this accidental discovery led me to make up a bunch of master culture slants with rye berries instead of agar, and they've all been in my chest freezer for over a month now.&amp;nbsp; I'll get them out in a year and see how they held up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9968748</prev>\n<first>9968743</first>\n<last>9969535</last>\n<when>1237048194</when>\n<utime>03/14/09 07:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
