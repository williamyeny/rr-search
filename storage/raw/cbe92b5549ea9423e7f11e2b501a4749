However, there is only so much food in a cake, so total yield is not going to be much different either way.  You'll get more flushes from a cake, but one or two larger ones from crumbling and casing.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to crumble the cakes, I'd suggest crumbling them into coir, manure or straw in order to give the mycelium some more food to eat, rather than simply crumbling as-is, and then putting a casing layer over it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6949294</next>\n<prev>6948806</prev>\n<first>6947983</first>\n<last>6949606</last>\n<when>1179798912</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 04:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
