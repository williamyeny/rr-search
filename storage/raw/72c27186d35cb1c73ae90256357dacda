Mycelium easily penetrates horse manure, while cow manure can pack down tight and become harder to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Composted cow manure from nurseries works fine if you lay it out on a tarp in the sun for a few days to burn the ammonia off.  When you prepare it, mix with up to 40% vermiculite to prevent clumping. Coir can be substituted for the verm.  It also helps to add coffee grinds from your morning pot of coffee if you have them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6260894</next>\n<prev>6260320</prev>\n<first>6260311</first>\n<last>6261890</last>\n<when>1163000262</when>\n<utime>11/08/06 05:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
