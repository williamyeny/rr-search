This is one of the major secondary pinning triggers.  Replace that lost moisture with misting.  An ultrasonic can easily saturate the casing layer, taking away this major pinning trigger.  I'd go from misting once a day to three or four times, and keep the air exchange up, provided you have mid to upper 90's humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7513579</next>\n<prev>7513123</prev>\n<first>7510514</first>\n<last>7793204</last>\n<when>1192325468</when>\n<utime>10/14/07 04:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
