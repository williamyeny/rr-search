I try to give a bit more than that because in addition to getting rid of the CO2, we're also trying to make an environment that is inhospitable for contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good rule of thumb is to provide as much air exchange as you can until your humidification system can't keep up, then back off slightly until it can.  Personally, I don't use a humidfier for air exchange.  I suggest to cut holes in your terrarium or mini-greenhouse for air exchange, and use your humidifiers for humidity.  Of course, each grower ends up developing his own teks for these things over time based on trial and error.  When one finds what works, he usually sticks with that method.  There's plenty of ways to skin the proverbial cat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6651032</prev>\n<first>6651032</first>\n<last>6651057</last>\n<when>1173417265</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 07:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
