I tried to get them for the grow I'm working on but out of stock. These are based on my own particular setup. All grown the same. For my money I would go with them again. Your mileage may vary. As a side note P.E takes more time to colonise than most at least in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly why we have a sticky at the top of the page for 'strain discussion'.&amp;nbsp; New growers soon find out that every grow is different.&amp;nbsp; Early on, they attribute this to the name someone wrote on the print or syringe.&amp;nbsp; Later, they realize every grow is just different because when you grow from spores, every grow is by definition a new strain.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17121272</prev>\n<first>17121148</first>\n<last>17121435</last>\n<when>1351487718</when>\n<utime>10/29/12 08:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
