Bear in mind, that's just a short sample clip from the full tek on DVD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use that method, sterilizing outdoors, and then carry the sterilized, but unsealed bags in a wheelbarrow across the back lawn into the house.&amp;nbsp; The tyvek sleeve keeps the contents sterile until you pull the sleeve out for inoculation in your glovebox or flow hood area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15338168</next>\n<prev>15338129</prev>\n<first>15338035</first>\n<last>15339888</last>\n<when>1320724228</when>\n<utime>11/08/11 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
