{"key":"post-6833149","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6833149</id>\n<content>I've posted many, many times to only clean a glovebox with soap and water, no chemicals.   In addition, the LAST thing you want near a printing cap is damp rid.  That absorbs moisture out of the air and the caps themselves.  A dry cap stops dropping spores.  It's common to actually cover caps with paper, foil, or even a bowl to keep them moist while printing so they drop more spores.   It sounds like you definitely ruined this batch.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6833405</next>\n<prev>6833124</prev>\n<first>6832257</first>\n<last>6833405</last>\n<when>1177538035</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 12:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
