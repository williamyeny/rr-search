Upper 70's is plenty warm.  Anything above 80 will lead to a higher contamination rate.  If your air temp is 85, the temp inside your jars will be a few degrees warmer, and growth rate falls off very rapidly above 86F.  I would recommend you consider 80 to be the maximum air temperature for use with grains.  Personally, I keep quart jars of rye grain on a bookshelf at normal, air conditioned room temperature and they colonize in 2 weeks or so.  The increased rate of contaminants above room temperature is not worth the extra day or two of faster colonization you will get.  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4547533</next>\n<prev>4546774</prev>\n<first>4546611</first>\n<last>4549099</last>\n<when>1124314818</when>\n<utime>08/18/05 12:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
