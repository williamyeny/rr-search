Sorry guys, but that doesn't make one bit of sense. It's against all logic. First of all, they probably wouldn't even pin in the darkness, much less grow. Belive me, I really would like to belive that, but it doesn't make sense to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mushrooms were NOT grown in the dark.&amp;nbsp; We've known for years that the psilocin degrades during drying, and we also know that our indoor mushrooms which are RARELY dried in sunlight are more potent.&amp;nbsp; This study is addressing natural SUNLIGHT, not our normal indoor lighting.&amp;nbsp; If you dry a mushroom in the sun and measure psilocin after drying and it weighs .0002 gram, then a 100X increase means there would have been .02 grams of psilocin in the fruit, had it been harvested and dried in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abstract didn't say the fruits were 100X more potent, just that there was 100X the amount of psilocin when kept out of sunlight during harvest and drying.&amp;nbsp; We've known this for decades, just not by how much.&amp;nbsp; What they tried to do was quantify what people around here have reported since day one.&amp;nbsp; Apparently the study didn't measure any effect on psilocybin.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11667074</next>\n<prev>11667048</prev>\n<first>11666108</first>\n<last>11677542</last>\n<when>1261064041</when>\n<utime>12/17/09 05:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
