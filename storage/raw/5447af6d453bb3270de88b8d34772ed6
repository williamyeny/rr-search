That appears to be what is happening here that got you so screwed up.&amp;nbsp; I've long thought we should censor the word 'TEK' when noobs use it to post their &lt;i&gt;less-than-bright&lt;/i&gt; ideas and act like they've been doing it successfully a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point: How on earth can the sides of the pressure cooker which are exposed to normal room temperature be hotter than the steam within?&amp;nbsp; The idea that the sides would melt the container but the steam wouldn't should make you look elsewhere for growing instructions. FYI, steam isn't hot enough to melt pp5 containers even though they suck for mushroom growing.&amp;nbsp; Use jars with proper filters.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19484853</next>\n<prev>19484840</prev>\n<first>19484780</first>\n<last>19504713</last>\n<when>1390912448</when>\n<utime>01/28/14 02:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
