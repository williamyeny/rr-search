I think from being wet. Same thing happened with the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've had over 5 aquarium heaters die on me and 3 shop light fixtures fail inexplicably. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impulse sealer for my spawn bags ceased functioning within a dozen uses, I suspect a faulty fuse but I have no idea what kind to replace it with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this sucks, so save your receipts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the 'made in fucking china world'.  It's how the multinational corporations have drastically increased our cost of living by making us buy the same stuff over and over again, rather than buy it once and keep it.  I still have my grandmothers old pre WW-2 electric coffee pot, and the darn thing still works, although I keep it on a shelf as a decoration now, but it was in daily use for 50 years.   In the last five years, I've had to buy at least three or four made in china coffee makers because they work for a year or less, then break or burn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is look for the best stuff you can find, and boycott walmart and china whenever possible.  In fact, my city won't allow walmart to buld a store here.  Everytime they apply for a permit, we flood city hall to demand they keep them the hell out of our town.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6714918</next>\n<prev>6714868</prev>\n<first>6713614</first>\n<last>6718028</last>\n<when>1174971860</when>\n<utime>03/27/07 08:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
