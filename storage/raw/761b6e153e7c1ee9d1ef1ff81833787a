Definitely need to build a walk-in cooler. The LED lighting has been working perfectly.&amp;nbsp; I have about 80% LEDs with a few CFLs to supplement the lighting.&amp;nbsp; Total electric bill for the farm now that we're in full production has been running just under $20/month for the lights and ventilation blower. We've been pulling about 30 pounds per day from our underground farm pictured below, and at least another 20 pounds per day from our spent substrates we've moved outdoors by the creek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're only sending the indoor grown mushrooms to the grocery stores, and use the slightly buggy outdoor ones to trade for produce, beef, sawdust, etc., with our neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We painted the door pink.&amp;nbsp; We've been thinking of changing the name to the 'Pink Door Mushroom Farm' but haven't decided on that for sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/10-30/054482710-Mountain_Mushroom_Farm-Shiitake.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/10-30/054482710-thumb_Mountain_Mushroom_Farm-Shiitake.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/10-30/054540926-Marc-shiitake.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/10-30/054540926-thumb_Marc-shiitake.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12978819</next>\n<prev>12446292</prev>\n<first>11681761</first>\n<last>13673392</last>\n<when>1280545686</when>\n<utime>07/31/10 06:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
