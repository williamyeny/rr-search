You should have three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite in the bottom.  This will give you 99% humidity.  I'd leave the lid open at least 10% for air exchange.  The perlite will still provide plenty of humidity, and the lid open will allow the air exchange you need.   You'll still want to fan it out a time or two per day. NEVER seal a fruiting chamber.  That's a recipe for molds and aborts. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6849086</next>\n<prev>6847135</prev>\n<first>6847130</first>\n<last>6849099</last>\n<when>1177864961</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
