He'll probably just pull out a few feet and give it to you free. Just make your own loops with that.&amp;nbsp; I prefer stainless because you can heat it up with a flame repeatedly rather than just one use from plastic until you autoclave again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16288825</next>\n<prev>16288529</prev>\n<first>16287754</first>\n<last>16289422</last>\n<when>1338074675</when>\n<utime>05/27/12 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
