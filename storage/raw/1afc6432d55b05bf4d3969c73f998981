It will break many of them in half, exposing uncolonized grains into a non-sterile envrionment.   Bang the jars against a fully inflated tire.  I use a mountain bike tire and air it up nice and hard each time I break up jars.  You can also bang them against a phone book, or even a 2 X 4, as long as it isn't oak or some other hardwood.  This way, you can separate the kernels without breaking them in half.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6595644</next>\n<prev>6595559</prev>\n<first>6594845</first>\n<last>6601586</last>\n<when>1172116933</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 06:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
