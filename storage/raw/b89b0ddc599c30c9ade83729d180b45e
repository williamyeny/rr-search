Set your mister for a very fine mist, then spray up into the air so the mist falls gently on the pins/substrate.  Mist only if they're drying out, otherwise just let them grow. Be sure to fan well or otherwise up the air exchange until the moisture either soaks into the pins or evaporates off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also inject water directly into the substrate with a clean syringe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5622123</next>\n<prev>5622057</prev>\n<first>5621819</first>\n<last>17874182</last>\n<when>1147478870</when>\n<utime>05/13/06 03:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
