No strain questions in the forums please.  'Strain' is irrelevant anyway because most aren't strains anyway, but just named as such.  Everytime somebody makes a print, it seems they give it a new name and call it a strain.  That's why we made the strain thread.  Just pick one.  If you're growing cubes, they're all the same species anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6728788</prev>\n<first>6728658</first>\n<last>6728818</last>\n<when>1175293450</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 01:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
