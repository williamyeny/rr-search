As little as a 10C increase in temperature doubles the capacity of the air to hold moisture.  That means if you increased temperature in a sealed container by 10C, the humidity would be cut in half if no additional humidity was added.  However, in a pod with a bubbler going, additional moisture would be added to the air, keeping humidity high because of the expanded capacity of the warmer air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowering humidity is not a problem in mushroom growing, getting enough humidity is the battle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6325499</next>\n<prev>6325442</prev>\n<first>6325217</first>\n<last>6325499</last>\n<when>1165027262</when>\n<utime>12/02/06 04:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
