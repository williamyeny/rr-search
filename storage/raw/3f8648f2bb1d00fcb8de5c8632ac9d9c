It's more nutritious than rice flour because brans still have the outer husk.&amp;nbsp; I also use it as a sawdust supplement for oysters and shiitake.&amp;nbsp; It's good stuff, and cheaper than brown rice to boot.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12657315</next>\n<prev>12657236</prev>\n<first>12657236</first>\n<last>12696318</last>\n<when>1275266313</when>\n<utime>05/31/10 03:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
