{"key":"post-7843437","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7843437</id>\n<content>It's not a good idea to make dark syringes.  No print is sterile(with the exception of the mushroom spores), so by making a dark print, you get more of the natural contaminants, which germinate and grow faster than mushroom mycelium.  A response to these contaminants is an increase in metabolites to counteract them.  Since your jars fully colonized and began pinning, they're fine, so go ahead and birth normally.  Next time however, use far fewer spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7843487</next>\n<prev>7843370</prev>\n<first>7832193</first>\n<last>7843497</last>\n<when>1199735891</when>\n<utime>01/07/08 09:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
