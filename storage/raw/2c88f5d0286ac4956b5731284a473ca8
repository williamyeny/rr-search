Just inject sterilized water into a colonized jar, shake and draw it back out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do it with quarts of rye.  I pour a full pint of sterilized, distilled water into a well shaken, fully colonized rye jar, then shake again and draw the myceliated water back out into 25 or more syringes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a flowhood because I have one, but a glovebox will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7097222</next>\n<prev>7097135</prev>\n<first>7096530</first>\n<last>7101316</last>\n<when>1182922726</when>\n<utime>06/27/07 08:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
