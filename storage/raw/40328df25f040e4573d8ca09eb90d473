It doesn't hurt cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer once the mycelium is growing is proper technique.  I'm an organic gardener, and use nothing once any mycelium is colonizing the substrate.  You don't need antimicrobials other than when cloning outdoor fruits when a bit of iodine will help to kill off bacteria.  I've also dipped mushroom tissue in up to 10% bleach prior to placing on agar.  This kills bacteria, but not molds or mushroom mycelium, which are not generally harmed by bleach.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6847081</prev>\n<first>6750702</first>\n<last>6849091</last>\n<when>1177865542</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
