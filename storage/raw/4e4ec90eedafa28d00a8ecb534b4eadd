In my experiments with isolated, single sector strains, none of it made a difference.  Potency remained the same.  I've used tryptamine HCL, triptophans in everything from rye grass seed to seaweed, and melatonin.   There was not one bit of difference between those and the control trays in my experiments.  No mutants, no increase or decrease in potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People using multispore inoculation are going to have potency that's all over the scale anyway, regardless of substrate, or additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thread is nearly a year old.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6586061</next>\n<prev>6585601</prev>\n<first>5451294</first>\n<last>6620218</last>\n<when>1171923008</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 12:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
