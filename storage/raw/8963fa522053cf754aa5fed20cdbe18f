{"key":"post-6788790","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6788790</id>\n<content>I have dozens of holes drilled into my terrariums on all six sides for air exchange.  I'd suggest that, and more perlite.  There really shouldn't be much condensation unless there is a temperature differential between the terrarium and the room it's in, especially if you'll drill holes as suggested.  My terrariums maintian humidity in the 95% to 99% range with all those holes and three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6789274</next>\n<prev>6788719</prev>\n<first>6788218</first>\n<last>6789274</last>\n<when>1176607734</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
