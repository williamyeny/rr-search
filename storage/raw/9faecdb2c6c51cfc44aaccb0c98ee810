Please treat it as such.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest thing you can do is to cut a few slits in the top part of the bag with a knife to allow for better air exchange.  This will allow the fruits to develop normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't recommend using this bag as spawn to manure because of the uncolonized portion.  There is usually a reason part of a substrate doesn't colonize.  The fruits will be fine to eat, but I wouldn't use it as spawn.  Wait for your next one to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6456392</next>\n<prev>6456365</prev>\n<first>6456176</first>\n<last>6456762</last>\n<when>1168736817</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 03:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
