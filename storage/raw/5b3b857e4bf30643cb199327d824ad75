{"key":"post-6341110","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6341110</id>\n<content>That bag of cow manure you posted a link to is at least ten times the price of getting composted cow manure at a local nursery.  What a rip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to do some serious reading and study before you begin.  Horse manure and coir are substrate materials, not casing.  You can mix horse manure and coir, then mix your spawn into it.  If you'll add a bit of gypsum to the substrate mix, performance will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it's fully colonized, the CASING layer goes on top, not bottom.  I recommend peat/verm, but most brands of commercial houseplant soil work fine, and are the old standard from the 70's and 80's.  In the 90's we started using peat/verm casings and pretty much pushed potting soil out the back door because of trichoderma problems due to the yard waste, but I see it's making a comeback with small grows.  The important thing to remember is the casing(top layer) needs to be inert, that is non-nutritious for fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6341128</next>\n<prev>6341071</prev>\n<first>6340085</first>\n<last>6342255</last>\n<when>1165446163</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 01:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
