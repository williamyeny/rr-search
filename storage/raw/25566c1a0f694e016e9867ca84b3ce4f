These tags, while an honor, are not intended to be an ego trip, but simply a help to our new members who often have to wade through conflicting advice on a new hobby that can seem overwhelming at first. If you're presented with two completely opposing answers to a question, and one of the members has a trusted cultivator tag, his or her advice would be your preferred answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moderators are in regular contact behind the scenes, and we'll be the ones to give the tags, and to take them away for cause when necessary.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure we've missed a few members who should have the tags, so as time goes on, we'll be adding more to the list.&amp;nbsp; We really hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>8903929</first>\n<last>8903929</last>\n<when>1221010936</when>\n<utime>09/10/08 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
