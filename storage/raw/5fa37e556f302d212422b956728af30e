{"key":"post-6358628","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6358628</id>\n<content>Oyster shell raises Ph.  Mushroom mycelium grows fastest with a slightly &lt;i&gt;acid&lt;/i&gt; ph.  You don't Ph adjust spawn.  The only reason we use Ph buffers to raise Ph in bulk substrates is because mushroom mycelium, while it prefers a Ph of 6, is &lt;i&gt;tolerant&lt;/i&gt; of Ph up to 8.5, while trichoderma is not tolerant of a high Ph.  Thus, the hydrated lime or oyster shell flour makes our substrate selective for mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't have used the oyster shell in with your spawn.  Spawn is grown out in sterile jars with filters where trichoderma isn't a problem if the jars were prepared and inoculated properly.  If they were not, the Ph buffer won't help anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6358716</next>\n<prev>6358599</prev>\n<first>6358599</first>\n<last>6359081</last>\n<when>1165885384</when>\n<utime>12/12/06 03:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
