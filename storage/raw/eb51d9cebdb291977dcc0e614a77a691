Glass petri dishes are not suitable for mycology due to the large numbers we go through.  I often have several hundred at a time going depending on the number of experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bear in mind that Petri dishes are not for the purpose of expanding mycelium.  They're for isolating strains from each other and from contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5805212</prev>\n<first>5804812</first>\n<last>5806307</last>\n<when>1151679077</when>\n<utime>06/30/06 05:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
