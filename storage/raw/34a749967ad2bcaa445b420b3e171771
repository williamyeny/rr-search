{"key":"post-6946987","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6946987</id>\n<content>I'm not pre-selling the videos.  I don't want to take anyone's money until I can offer same day shipping.  The manufacturer just called and said the videos were shipped today, Monday, by 2'nd day air, so I should have them Wednesday.  As soon as I open the box, plop one into the DVD player and see it work, I'll unlock my storefront and take orders.  I have everything set up, just waiting for the disks to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inoculate in front of a flow hood, by actuall lifting the lid up and dropping in an agar wedge or by g2g.  If your injecting without a flowhood, look in to agar's injection port lids. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.natures-resources.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.natures-resources.com&lt;wbr&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15697298</next>\n<prev>6946302</prev>\n<first>6923658</first>\n<last>27218916</last>\n<when>1179770855</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 09:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
