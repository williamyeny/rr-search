Sorry.&amp;nbsp; If you're using a 12&quot; X 24&quot; hepa filter, you need a blower that will deliver an AIR SPEED leaving the filter of roughly 100 linear feet per minute.&amp;nbsp; Since a 12 X 24 has two square feet, you would want a motor that could deliver 200 cubic feet per minute at rated static pressure IN a perfect world.&amp;nbsp; Since we don't live in a perfect world, and there's friction losses between the blower and the filter, add about 20% or so to the blower output requirements to make up for these losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the above, if you were using a 24&quot; X 24&quot; filter, you would have 4 square feet of surface, so you would want a 400 cubic feet per minute blower at the rated static pressure IN a perfect world.&amp;nbsp; Adding 20% to that figure, you'd want a blower that could give you about 480 to 500 cfm.&amp;nbsp; If your blower is too strong, you can always block off part of the intake to cut down on flow.&amp;nbsp; This is commonly used in commercial and industrial facilities and won't harm the blower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing is to make sure the blower you order is rated at the required static pressure.&amp;nbsp; Many cheap blowers might be rated at 'such and such' a flow rate, but at pressure it drops to near zero because they simply cavitate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17917030</next>\n<prev>10903095</prev>\n<first>10874875</first>\n<last>17917030</last>\n<when>1250867133</when>\n<utime>08/21/09 06:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
