I'm still wondering about how often I will get contams due to that 100th of 1% inefficiency rating?........MM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost never.&amp;nbsp; Here's why.&amp;nbsp; You're going to use the flowhood in a small, tightly sealed room, such as a spare bedroom. Spray the face of the filter lightly with Lysol before each use.&amp;nbsp; This will kill any bacteria or mold spores which have landed on the exposed surface.&amp;nbsp; Allow the flowhood to run for at least an hour in this small room before starting your sterile work.&amp;nbsp; By doing so, the air in the room will have circulated and then re-circulated through the filter many times, thus that .001% you're worried about becomes .00001% and then .000000001%, etc., with each pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're far more likely to contaminate your work by allowing your hands to come between the filter and your exposed media than for what slips through to reach your work.&amp;nbsp; The video shows how to properly position your hands(surgical-gloved of course) to mitigate this problem.&amp;nbsp; The video also shows how to properly open jars and petri dishes to ensure that no contaminants can enter, and gives tips on how to prevent &lt;i&gt;yourself&lt;/i&gt; from being the number 1 vector of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13497099</next>\n<prev>13494025</prev>\n<first>13492608</first>\n<last>13503795</last>\n<when>1289954070</when>\n<utime>11/17/10 02:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
