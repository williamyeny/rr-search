That's just one more reason to toss out any projects with green molds on them.  However, the above is from breathing in the spores from a moldy house or basement, not from eating a mushroom.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5652494</next>\n<prev>5652450</prev>\n<first>5651684</first>\n<last>5656597</last>\n<when>1148130188</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 04:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
