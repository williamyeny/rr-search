My favorite source of tyvek is the coveralls you can buy in the paint department at your local home megacenter.  You'll get over 100 jar filters from a $5 pair of coveralls.  Another source that's even higher quality is kite building tyvek.  A good place to order it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intothewind.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.intothewind.com&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even with two cartons of tyvek coveralls sitting on my shelf, I use synthetic filter disks.   They're infinitely re-usable and cut to the exact size of the jar rings.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6548293</next>\n<prev>6547650</prev>\n<first>6546643</first>\n<last>6548410</last>\n<when>1171057796</when>\n<utime>02/09/07 11:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
