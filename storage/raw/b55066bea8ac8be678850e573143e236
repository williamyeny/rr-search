They want a full spectrum, or at least a light in the higher end of the spectrum, such as cool white fluorescent. They won't do nearly as well with a blue mood light. Halogen is ok, but they emit a lot of heat.  In my experience, flourescents are the best due to low heat output.  Being near a window is even better, as long as they're not in direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5929513</next>\n<prev>5929481</prev>\n<first>5929481</first>\n<last>5929866</last>\n<when>1154654002</when>\n<utime>08/04/06 04:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
