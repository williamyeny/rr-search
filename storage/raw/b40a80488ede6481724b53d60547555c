Perlite humidfication is considered optional with cased substrates, but I'd use it anyway for the extra humidity, then leave the lid crooked and drill a few holes in the side of the FC for constant air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To allow the perlite to have maximum surface area, elevate your tray on whatever you can find around the house.  A screen would work, or an unused dishwasher shelf, or you can bend some heavy wire to make a rack to elevate the tray above the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6210060</next>\n<prev>6208796</prev>\n<first>6208299</first>\n<last>6210060</last>\n<when>1161752363</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 07:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
