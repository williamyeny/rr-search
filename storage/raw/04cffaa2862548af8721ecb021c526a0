Any experiences with this urself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And do u think an experiment to compare blue light to red light after pinning is necessary or nahh?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That might be overkill, but it won't hurt.&amp;nbsp; Don't get too 'blue'.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a color temperature of 6500K is perfect.&amp;nbsp; If you go above 7500K, performance will drop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good rule of thumb is the brighter you can make it without impacting humidity via excess heat is going to be OK.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms derive energy from the light to convert sugars in the substrate to ATP in the cells, but via a different mechanism than the one plants use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms are 100% mycelium, so don't change color spectrum as you would with plants.&amp;nbsp; Keep the 6500k fluorescent right through fruiting.&amp;nbsp; Hanging them vertically in front of a mini-greenhouse is fine.&amp;nbsp; It's what I do when growing indoors.&amp;nbsp; Light from the sides is just as good if not better than light from above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12623514</next>\n<prev>12619350</prev>\n<first>12619117</first>\n<last>12644655</last>\n<when>1274719718</when>\n<utime>05/24/10 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
