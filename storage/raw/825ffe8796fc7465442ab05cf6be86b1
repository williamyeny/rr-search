However when successful cloning from large mushrooms, they have the added advantage of being fairly clean because the middle of the stems are not exposed to the air like pins. To each their own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large mushroom is mycelium which has already slowed down and lost some of its vigor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pins are rapidly growing. It matters not if they've been exposed to the air since the mycelium will outrun any contaminants.&amp;nbsp; You simply take a small wedge from the leading edge of the mycelium and transfer it to a new plate.&amp;nbsp; The P2 plate is the one you use to inoculate grains, not the P1, which will have any contaminants from the original clone.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15375583</prev>\n<first>15371198</first>\n<last>15375870</last>\n<when>1321410807</when>\n<utime>11/16/11 04:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
