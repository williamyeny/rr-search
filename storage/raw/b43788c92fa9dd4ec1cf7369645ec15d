If you use a massive amount of spores to find some that will survive the peroxide, it makes sense that you'll also be placing a massive amount of contaminants, some of which also will survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save peroxide for control of cobweb mold.  It has little other use in mycology besides possibly helping to control mold in humidifiers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6294374</next>\n<prev>6294293</prev>\n<first>5831095</first>\n<last>11196420</last>\n<when>1163803799</when>\n<utime>11/18/06 12:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
