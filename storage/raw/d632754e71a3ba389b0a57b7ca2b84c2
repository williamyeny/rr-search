If you prepare your rye properly, there will be ZERO busted kernels, which spill starch and make it very hard for the mycelium to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempting to make your mycelium colonize busted kernels is like trying to get your car to drive cross country on two flat tires-possible, but not recommended for good performance and speed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7757846</next>\n<prev>7757702</prev>\n<first>7757540</first>\n<last>7769299</last>\n<when>1197654178</when>\n<utime>12/14/07 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
