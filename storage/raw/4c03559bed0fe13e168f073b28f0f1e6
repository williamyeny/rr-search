As long as you fan the FC you should be fine either way.&amp;nbsp; Light isnt completly nessisary. No it does promote pinning and mushies are photosensitive, so they don't need it but will react to it and grow towards it. Hope i helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just couldn't let that go without challenge.&amp;nbsp; Your misunderstanding of mycology matches your inability to use the English language.&amp;nbsp; Nothing you said above is correct. You're simply using illiterate prose to repeat once again the long-disproved 'theories' about fungi that fuck up so many grows by people who actually use the search engine to learn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14866479</next>\n<prev>14866376</prev>\n<first>14866244</first>\n<last>14876318</last>\n<when>1312383996</when>\n<utime>08/03/11 06:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
