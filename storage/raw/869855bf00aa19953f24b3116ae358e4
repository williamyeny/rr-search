Pint jars perform poorly in most cases.  If you want more substrate, you can stack two cakes after colonization and the dunk and roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're also supposed to remove the foil after sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruiting chamber need not be in a sterile or extremely clean location.  Fully colonized cakes are resistant to most contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look OK, but you have them too warm.  Reduce temperature to normal room temp and you'll see fewer metabolites.  There's up to a ten degree inrease in temperature within the jars, so you're at 90+ which slows down growth considerably.  Remember, glass is an insulator, which is why we use it for windows.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8417561</next>\n<prev>8417478</prev>\n<first>8417478</first>\n<last>8419419</last>\n<when>1211156397</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 03:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
