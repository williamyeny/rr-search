Your cakes are ruined and when you lift the jars out, you'll probably find several broken.  Start over and pay attention next time.  Why would you leave the stove on high while you went for a walk?  You won't get the water over 212/100c no matter how high the stove is.  Once it begins to boil, turn the stove as low as it will go and still keep the water boiling.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5654671</next>\n<prev>5654652</prev>\n<first>5654642</first>\n<last>5654671</last>\n<when>1148183224</when>\n<utime>05/21/06 06:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
