In commercial HVAC systems, a varicone is commonly used to regulate airflow, thus keeping the building at the correct static pressure.&amp;nbsp; If static pressure is too high, the doors don't close, if too low, dirt enters the building.&amp;nbsp; However, the blower motor runs at the same speed all the time and the intake is blocked to control pressure.&amp;nbsp; You can test this yourself.&amp;nbsp; Block part of the intake on a blower while&amp;nbsp; a clamp-on ammeter is around one of the motor leads.&amp;nbsp; You'll see a decrease in current.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To BEEP, it sounds like you didn't build your plenum large enough.&amp;nbsp; If the same pressure is exerted across the back of the filter, the flow will be even out the front.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12455527</next>\n<prev>12446958</prev>\n<first>12379669</first>\n<last>12578952</last>\n<when>1272087336</when>\n<utime>04/24/10 08:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
