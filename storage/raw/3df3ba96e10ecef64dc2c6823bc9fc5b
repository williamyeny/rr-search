{"key":"post-7849701","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7849701</id>\n<content>Leave it, you're fine.  Electric hygrometers from china are crap.  That's fewer holes than I drill, but they look larger.  I use 1/4 inch.  As long as the holes are on all six sides, you should have plenty of humidity with that much perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a good hygrometer at any quality cigar shop for $15 to $20.  Search 'calibrate hygrometer' and my name for the procedure I recommend.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7850025</next>\n<prev>7849671</prev>\n<first>7849515</first>\n<last>7850253</last>\n<when>1199843447</when>\n<utime>01/09/08 03:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
