Just eat two mushroom caps instead of one.&amp;nbsp; It makes them taste like a gourmet mushroom, and you don't get that ill feeling from eating them raw, dry or undried.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10672713</next>\n<prev>10669999</prev>\n<first>5168021</first>\n<last>26943951</last>\n<when>1247523393</when>\n<utime>07/14/09 01:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
