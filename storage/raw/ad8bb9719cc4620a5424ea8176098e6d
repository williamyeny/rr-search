That's the problem with making liquid culture from unproved mycelium or spores.  You might be wasting a lot of time on the LC when you could be growing mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have growth in less than two days that is visible to the naked eye, chances are much greater that it's mold then mushroom mycelium which is much slower.  You could dip into the LC with a sterile loop and pull out a little piece for microscope ID, but that's about the only way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6283007</next>\n<prev>6282662</prev>\n<first>6275956</first>\n<last>6283061</last>\n<when>1163543111</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 12:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
