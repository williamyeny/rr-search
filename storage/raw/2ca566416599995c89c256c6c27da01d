As said, get an analog hygrometer and properly calibrate it at the high end of the scale.  I'd also get rid of the aquarium light and get a flurorescent in the range suggested above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7617708</next>\n<prev>7617657</prev>\n<first>7617195</first>\n<last>7617708</last>\n<when>1194698703</when>\n<utime>11/10/07 02:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
