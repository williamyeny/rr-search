With no heat, there will be no burst grains. The grain will begin to grow stuff on the second day, but it's all going in the PC anyway. A long soak insures that all contams have germinated and are vulnerable to the heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest 24 hours MAX for soaking.&amp;nbsp; I've even shortened that lately.&amp;nbsp; Many endospores germinate during the soak and form new endospores within hours, so a long soak time is actually counter-productive.&amp;nbsp; You could easily end up with more endospores than you started with.&amp;nbsp; A four to five hour soak in HOT tap water will ensure the grains have softened up enough that they won't burst when you bring them to a boil, and that should be enough to get some of the endospores at least hydrated, if not germinated and they'll get killed easier in the PC.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10712214</next>\n<prev>10712061</prev>\n<first>5660995</first>\n<last>10826067</last>\n<when>1248148996</when>\n<utime>07/21/09 07:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
