The gauge is a mechanical thingy which could be way out of calibration. The weight, on the other hand, relies on a very simple physics principle, and has no calibration. For a certain aperture size (the nipple opening as determined by the weight inside diameter), a fixed amount of pressure is needed to lift the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Terry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not entirely correct.&amp;nbsp; The weight/nozzle interface is a precision-milled mating surface.&amp;nbsp; As the weight jiggles on the nozzle over time, wear occurs.&amp;nbsp; When this wear opens up the nozzle to a larger opening, it pushes the weight off at a lower pressure.&amp;nbsp; Many AA owners think they have a faulty gauge after a few years, when in fact it's the nozzle/weight combination which is showing wear, resulting in a lower pressure.&amp;nbsp; When this happens, the two should be replaced as a unit together.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17147079</next>\n<prev>17146742</prev>\n<first>17146575</first>\n<last>17153426</last>\n<when>1351865915</when>\n<utime>11/02/12 05:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
