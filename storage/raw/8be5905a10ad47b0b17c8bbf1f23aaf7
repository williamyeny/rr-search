Nobody has shown even the slightest increase in potency from adding anything to a substrate.  I have no problems with research and applaud all efforts, but they should not be stating such things as triptamines or anything else increase potency when the evidence shows otherwise. What is bound to happen is somebody will come up with something usefull and nobody will believe it because of all the previous false hype.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5896005</next>\n<prev>5895649</prev>\n<first>5895578</first>\n<last>5896737</last>\n<when>1153794749</when>\n<utime>07/25/06 05:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
