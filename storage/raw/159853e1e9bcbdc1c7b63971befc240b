{"key":"post-7358239","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7358239</id>\n<content>I've always recommended people in dry climates run a humidifier in the general area or room their grow is located.  If you can bring the ambient humidity up to 50%, you'll have no problems.  While it's true that Seattle has a damp climate in the fall, winter and spring, summers are very dry here.  I always run a cool mist 24/7 in the room my terrariums are located.  This becomes especially important if using a terrarium with many holes drilled into it.  Air exchange is a major pinning trigger as well as preventer of contamination, so make sure your ambient humidity is up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7358245</next>\n<prev>7358225</prev>\n<first>7358225</first>\n<last>7358593</last>\n<when>1188657609</when>\n<utime>09/01/07 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
