Nobody does.  There were some inconclusive experiments done years ago, that have never to my knowledge been duplicated, but the stories keep circulating as though they were fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were as easy to increase potency as changing the food, don't you think we'd have developed a pill that would make us twice as strong, or twice as smart?  Give your fruits a good substrate and you'll get what you're looking for. Personally, I believe genetics determines potency, provided the fungus has a good diet.  Much like us humans.
