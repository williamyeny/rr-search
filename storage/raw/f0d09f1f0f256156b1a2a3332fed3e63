Go ahead and dunk if you're not sure because it can help and certainly can't hurt.  Pins will often double or triple in size during an overnight dunk and begin growing again.  Just put your cake in cold water overnight and use something to hold it under water.  A large jar with a lid works well, or you can leave it under gently running water in your sink for ten to twelve hours.  The reason for using cold water is to prevent bacteria growth during the time the substrate is under water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5775665</next>\n<prev>5775605</prev>\n<first>5740845</first>\n<last>5776681</last>\n<when>1150894489</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 03:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
