Two types of mycelium indicates one of them at least is the wrong kind.  Bang the jar against a tire or phone book to loosen up the kernels, then dump it outside somewhere.  Don't put yourself downwind from the jar as you dump it out.  You don't want all that mold sticking to your clothes to just bring it back in with you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6224014</prev>\n<first>6223809</first>\n<last>6224245</last>\n<when>1162160246</when>\n<utime>10/30/06 12:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
