Don't set chicken wire right on the perlite unless you fold it in half or something first.  You don't want the cake touching the perlite or it can become waterlogged.  Hardware cloth is better because it's a finer mesh.  The advantage of using wire is that more of your perlite is exposed to the air, thus keeping humidity high.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6849024</prev>\n<first>6849004</first>\n<last>6849036</last>\n<when>1177864047</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
