Thats not what I have been told to do. My first jars are colonizing rapidly just sitting on a shelf normal top up with no covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the correct method, not upside down.&amp;nbsp; In addition, trying to stop contaminant spores with a coffee filter is a lot like trying to catch minnows with a shark net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a proved fact that mycelium colonizes faster with low levels of light exposure in a day/night routine.&amp;nbsp; Save very bright light for the fruiting stage, but several hours of dim, ambient room light during colonization is beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13055525</next>\n<prev>13055166</prev>\n<first>13046952</first>\n<last>13064452</last>\n<when>1281903791</when>\n<utime>08/15/10 11:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
