Nor will 'positive pressure' since a cool mist won't produce enough that a bug can't fly right through it.  Don't worry though, they don't eat much.  I rarely even get concerned with them.  If their numbers get too high, simply suck them out of the area with your vacuum cleaner hose.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8096709</next>\n<prev>8096464</prev>\n<first>8096308</first>\n<last>8100909</last>\n<when>1204558817</when>\n<utime>03/03/08 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
