It takes a hell of a lot less time to use the search engine than to wait for answers and then bitch when people don't write a book for the 100th time, just for you. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't believe how lazy the internet has made people.&amp;nbsp; Back when we had to burn a tank of gas to hit ten different university and county libraries just to find an answer, you sure as hell didn't find people bitching about not being spoonfed knowledge because they were too lazy to look. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15432049</next>\n<prev>15430541</prev>\n<first>15427225</first>\n<last>18284219</last>\n<when>1322437408</when>\n<utime>11/28/11 01:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
