{"key":"post-6135898","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6135898</id>\n<content>Plain vermiculite is probably the worst possible choice for a casing material.  Plain peat would work better, but a 50/50 mix of the two seems to work better than either one by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to lime the peat at the rate of one teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat and add at least a tablespoon or two of gypsum per cup of peat. You can use gypsum up to 10% by volume of the amount of peatmoss. If you have a ph tester, go for an initial ph of 8 to 8.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want your casing layer on the top.  Don't apply casing to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6135734</prev>\n<first>6135734</first>\n<last>6135898</last>\n<when>1160067094</when>\n<utime>10/05/06 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
