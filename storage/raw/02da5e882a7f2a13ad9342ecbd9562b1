I've cloned tissue from fruits before and observed multiple sectors branch out.  I don't mean different mycelium types, but actual sectors of non-compatible strains.  It's fairly rare because most strains combine via anastomosis prior to flushing, but it does happen sometimes, and it's much more common when cloning wild fruits.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6668392</next>\n<prev>6668333</prev>\n<first>6668110</first>\n<last>6669431</last>\n<when>1173891875</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 08:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
