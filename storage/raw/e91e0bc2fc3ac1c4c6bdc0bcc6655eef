Since there's no way to get in behind the fan and magnatron to clean it, they circulate bacteria laden air that will contaminate your agar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you're supposed to pour the agar after it's been sterilized(in a pressure cooker).  With glass dishes you sterilize them on a rack in a pressure cooker, while empty, and then you pour the sterilized agar into the sterilized dishes using a glovebox or laminar flow hood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6897025</next>\n<prev>6896900</prev>\n<first>6896667</first>\n<last>6900819</last>\n<when>1178807785</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 05:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
