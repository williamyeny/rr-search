What I get is in the same bags as Agars, except it's a grade or two finer.  It's not like sand, but not course either.  Just mix with limed peat and don't forget the gypsum.  Those two are far more important than the grade of vermiculite.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6790001</next>\n<prev>6789927</prev>\n<first>6789840</first>\n<last>6790152</last>\n<when>1176651589</when>\n<utime>04/15/07 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
