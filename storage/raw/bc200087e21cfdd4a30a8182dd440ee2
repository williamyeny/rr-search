I've found mexicana to be much more like acid than mushrooms.  It's a cleaner trip, without the body numbing that makes it hard to move or communicate with cubensis.  I've also found sclerotia to be a much more spiritual trip than cubes.  In addition, it's shorter lasting, so it's not out of the question to do on a weeknight, when you have to be at work the next day.   They're my favorite, along with ps cyans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use rye berries, but they're simple as pie to clean up.  Simply take a stone in your hands and rub the grains off with your fingers.  The texture is similar to nuts, and the mushroom taste is mild and not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6603102</next>\n<prev>6602974</prev>\n<first>6600180</first>\n<last>7017985</last>\n<when>1172275742</when>\n<utime>02/24/07 02:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
