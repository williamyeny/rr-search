The reason I say get a few is they're undoubtedly made in china and half won't work right out of the box, just like every thing else they dump on our markets. Calibrate by wrapping in a damp towel for an hour, and then adjust the screw on the back so the dial reads 99%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cigar humidors run around 70%, so the digitals work OK, but at 99%, they suck.&amp;nbsp; The high end cigar shops have good ones, but the cheapie I posted a link to will do the job.&amp;nbsp; Simply search for 'accurate analog hygrometer' on google, and you'll find hundreds to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponsors tip:&amp;nbsp; Somebody should stock these. . .wait, I'm a sponsor and I don't stock them either. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8541432</next>\n<prev>8541216</prev>\n<first>8533504</first>\n<last>11888868</last>\n<when>1213915511</when>\n<utime>06/20/08 01:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
