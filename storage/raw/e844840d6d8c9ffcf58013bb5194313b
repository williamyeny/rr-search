Further, he didn't ask about substrate, he asked about vitamins/minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One observation I've made over the years is that a majority of growers seem to leave gypsum out of their compost and casing recipies.  Gypsum provides calcium and sulphur, which are both necessary for good fruitbody formation.  Gypsum will also buffer your substrate or casing, preventing wild swings in ph. Use at up to ten percent of the total material in your casing or compost by volume.  I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5395166</next>\n<prev>5394983</prev>\n<first>5393285</first>\n<last>5409146</last>\n<when>1142277666</when>\n<utime>03/13/06 09:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
