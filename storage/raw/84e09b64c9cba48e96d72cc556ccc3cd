It does no good to propose a way to grow without verm if you're still using the verm as a filter.  You can also use tyvek or filter disks with pf jars and skip the verm.  You'll know when fruiting time comes if the soil conditioner works.  Vermiculite is used because of its enormous moisture holding capacity.  It provides an inner reservoir for moisture that supports the flush.  Many ingredients have been used over the years such as coir, but none hold the same amount of water as vermiculite, which is what makes it the gold standard.  Next time, I'd skip the inner layer of foil.  I'm sure it's fine though, as long as the mycelium has openings to get some gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6849035</next>\n<prev>6849027</prev>\n<first>6848854</first>\n<last>7245834</last>\n<when>1177863900</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
