Verm is great mixed with everything mycological except straw.  Used coffee grinds from your morning pot of coffee are also an excellent additive.  Ditto for worm castings. A small amount of chicken manure is also beneficial but don't go over 5% by volume of the substrate.  Put a combination of all together in your substrate and watch your mushies thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5750176</next>\n<prev>5750039</prev>\n<first>5749779</first>\n<last>5750176</last>\n<when>1150321481</when>\n<utime>06/15/06 12:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
