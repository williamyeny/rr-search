In theory, this practice, over duration, combined with good cleaning and sterilization procedures should keep airborn contaminates at a very very very low level!&amp;nbsp; And its WAAAAAAAAAY cheaper than buying all those cans of OUST!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you could mix up a ten percent bleach solution into a simple hand mister and spray it into the air before doing sterile work.&amp;nbsp; I used to use Oust, but it was expensive, of dubious value, and certainly no more effective than bleach which is 1% of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15949314</prev>\n<first>15897788</first>\n<last>15950097</last>\n<when>1331823317</when>\n<utime>03/15/12 05:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
