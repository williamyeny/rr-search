The problem is worse when using popcorn as spawn due to the large kernel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your substrate inoclation was secure, then make sure you have plenty of air exchange.  Molds need stale air, mushroom mycelium thrives in fresh air.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sterilized casing layer will be more prone to contamination than a pasteurized one.  In fact, certain species won't pin if you sterilize the casing layer.  Agaricus and azurescens are two such species.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5673107</prev>\n<first>5670135</first>\n<last>5673333</last>\n<when>1148589967</when>\n<utime>05/25/06 11:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
