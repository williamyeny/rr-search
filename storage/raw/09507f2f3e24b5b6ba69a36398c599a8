If the bacteria gets out of hand, you'll be able to see it in the mycelium as a '&lt;i&gt;greasy&lt;/i&gt;' appearance. Also, there will be zones in the grains/brf where the mycelium won't colonize.  When this happens, toss out the jar.  If the mycelium overruns the bacteria, it will eat it for lunch and your substrate will fruit normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, I'm talking about substrate in a jar.  If a mushroom fruit body has started to rot, by all means toss it out and don't eat it.  However, a jar that has recovered from a bit of bacteria during colonization is fine to fruit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6086830</next>\n<prev>6086582</prev>\n<first>6085406</first>\n<last>9666263</last>\n<when>1158869270</when>\n<utime>09/21/06 11:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
