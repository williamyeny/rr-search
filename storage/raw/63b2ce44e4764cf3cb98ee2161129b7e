I am willing to try just about anything. Hell, One time I tried to scrape some spores off a print into a bowl of original quaker oats to see if I could get growth. Well, I got mold. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all do those kinds of little projects, and it's cool because our failures are what we learn best from.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drama queens are the ones who start the bowl of oatmeal and spores and then begin posting how they've discovered a new TEK and how everybody wasting time on sterilization are idiots.&amp;nbsp; Then they get butthurt when others come in and tell them it won't work, as if we're against experimenting, or somehow responsible for their self-esteem. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/whatever.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:whatever:&quot; title=&quot;:whatever:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when the flame fests start.
