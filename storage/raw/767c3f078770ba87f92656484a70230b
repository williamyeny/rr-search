{"key":"post-6072322","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6072322</id>\n<content>All three of those appear to have mold.  You can see it best in the last picture.  Anytime you have two distinct colors/types of growth, at least one of them is mold. The third jar shows it very clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second jar looks to have green mold in the bottom, but it could be a reflection from the camera flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should have been fully colonized within two two three weeks tops, so something is bad wrong. Make up a new batch and try again.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6072338</next>\n<prev>6072159</prev>\n<first>6071671</first>\n<last>7353075</last>\n<when>1158550820</when>\n<utime>09/18/06 06:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
