Speaking for cubes only, if I just give them 1-2 min. of daylight fluorescent tubes right over the surface moving back &amp; forth for a little while during the couple of times I fan them, then I've gotten literally pins in every possible space on the surface (too much so sometimes I feel.) Even other times w/o every possible space having one, I'll still get a plethora of pins. I guess i don't see an advantage to any more light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's after pinning starts that light really becomes important.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown with proper lighting will be double or more in weight of those grown without.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14117207</next>\n<prev>14116592</prev>\n<first>14114088</first>\n<last>14119652</last>\n<when>1300079075</when>\n<utime>03/14/11 08:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
