Mushrooms don't grow hydroponically, so it doesn't matter what kind of liquid you add.  Mycelium &lt;i&gt;eats&lt;/i&gt; its food.  That's why the substrate shrinks over time.  Adding liquid 'nutes' is for plants.  You'd have to add solid food for mycelium, and that's pretty hard because the dormant contaminant spores that are on the substrate would take over the new food quicker than the mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7575604</next>\n<prev>7575574</prev>\n<first>7489655</first>\n<last>7577408</last>\n<when>1193749414</when>\n<utime>10/30/07 04:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
