{"key":"post-8636737","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8636737</id>\n<content>Hopefully, nobody follows bad advice to skip using a filter.&amp;nbsp; I've seen guys use jar lids upside down, and when tightened, they form a pretty good seal, but still allow some gasses to get through.&amp;nbsp; A few growers have had success with this method, but most do not.&amp;nbsp; When I tried it, success was about 80%. While some growers consider 80% pretty darn good, I consider a 20% failure rate completely unacceptable.&amp;nbsp; My jars of sclerotia may 'look' not to have a filter, but they're filtered with a synthetic filter disk between the lid and the ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pan Cyans don't produce sclerotia.&amp;nbsp; Many species produce stroma and other weird clumps that are commonly mistaken for sclerotia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mexicana a, Mexicana b, Jalisco&lt;/i&gt;, and the new &lt;i&gt;Atl 7&lt;/i&gt; are all good stone producers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Tamps&lt;/i&gt; should also be in the list, although Mex a is my personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate your grains or rye grass seed with &lt;i&gt;weak&lt;/i&gt; liquid coffee, and you'll get more rocks.&amp;nbsp; I don't know why, it just does.&amp;nbsp; You can get the measurements from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Rye-Grass-Seed-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;rye grass seed&lt;/a&gt; tek at mushroomvideos.com.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8637427</next>\n<prev>8636662</prev>\n<first>8634241</first>\n<last>8786774</last>\n<when>1216129215</when>\n<utime>07/15/08 04:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
