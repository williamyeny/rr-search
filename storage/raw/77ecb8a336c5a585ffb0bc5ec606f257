{"key":"post-7692422","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7692422</id>\n<content>I have two 4&quot; holes near the bottom on each side.  Two more 4&quot; holes are at the top on each side.  The door is an opening that covers the entire front, nearly 5 feet across.  It's a sheet of plastic that hangs down from the top, with a piece of PVC pipe at the bottom to hold it shut by gravity.  The side slits are not attached to anything, thus air exchanges the full length from top to bottom on each side of the door, and the other 4 holes also pass air.  There's also a few smaller holes I've cut for taking pictures and never sealed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to have as much air exchange as you can possibly have and still keep mid 90's percent humidity.  I use 2 vicks kaz coolmists sitting inside the greenhouse, set to run 1 minute on, 4 to 6 minutes off depending on ambient humidity.  I'll tweak it daily due to local conditions.  When things get really dry weather-wise, I'll often run a third coolmist in the room the greenhouse is located to raise the ambient humidity.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad to see you using the search feature.  That's how you found this I'm sure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7693000</next>\n<prev>7691394</prev>\n<first>6355086</first>\n<last>7693134</last>\n<when>1196305462</when>\n<utime>11/29/07 05:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
