Dont risk it, try, try again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolute total nonsense.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green molds common to mushroom cultivation are not toxic to humans.  In addition, one fungus will NOT spread through the network of ANOTHER fungus.  Don't spread disinformation on the board.  If what you said was true, all outdoor grown mushrooms would be toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good move to toss out the contaminated tray.  Those green spores would have led to higher contamination rates in your grow areas had you left it.  Your fruits are safe to eat.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6098114</next>\n<prev>6098041</prev>\n<first>6097968</first>\n<last>6099103</last>\n<when>1159201234</when>\n<utime>09/25/06 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
