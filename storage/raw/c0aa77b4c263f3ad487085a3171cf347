See if datomaceous earth will 86 them.  It only works when totally dry, so you'll have to sprinkle down fresh whenever you mist.  The plus side is DE is great mixed in with casing material.  It holds a ton of water, way more than verm.  You can sprinkle DE on all your shelves too. Put anywhere the gnats land, so they'll crawl across it and get cut to shreds.  DE to a bug is like us crawling naked across a bed of broken glass.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5680451</next>\n<prev>5679871</prev>\n<first>5625063</first>\n<last>5999227</last>\n<when>1148753537</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 09:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
