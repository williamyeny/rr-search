In fact, cubes do very well without a casing layer at all.  If you're using manure or compost, you can skip the casing layer completely and get your flush a week or two sooner.  Simply dunk between flushes.  Dunking is faster than waiting for a casing layer to colonize.  Larger substrates can be dunked in the kitchen sink or bathtub by allowing the tap water to run onto and over the substrate overnight. The gently running water will keep circulation in the tub and prevent bacterial growth.  Smaller substrates can be dunked in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4673238</next>\n<prev>4672766</prev>\n<first>4671909</first>\n<last>4674020</last>\n<when>1126957234</when>\n<utime>09/17/05 02:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
