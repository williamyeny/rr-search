Take it outside and put it in the shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to clone onto agar so you can isolate away from contaminants.  Simply tear a stem lengthwise into two halves, then use a sterile razor or scalpel to scrape a bit of mycelium from the center of the stem that hasn't ever been exposed to the outside air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn't clone from a tray with contaminants.  Wait until you get a nice flush with lots of large clusters, then clone from one of the most aggressive clusters.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6083167</prev>\n<first>6083167</first>\n<last>6083555</last>\n<when>1158800453</when>\n<utime>09/21/06 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
