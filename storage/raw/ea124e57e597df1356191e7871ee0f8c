There is a huge difference between a paper filter 1&quot; thick and a metal/ceramic laminar flow hood filter 11&quot; thick.  It would certainly be nice if we could get a $79 unit from the hardware store or sears that would work instead of a $500 flowhood, but sadly that isn't the case.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4267322</next>\n<prev>4266843</prev>\n<first>4266711</first>\n<last>4267322</last>\n<when>1118155443</when>\n<utime>06/07/05 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
