I believe with the fans coming on 7 times a day, for whatever length of time I need to set it for, will most likely put FAE as a &quot;past&quot; problem. There are enough holes in the plexi lids that with a small computer fan pulling from the outside it should be corrected. Don't you think?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're fruiting cakes, use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium built per the tek&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; All those fans and stuff will screw up performance.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17983769</next>\n<prev>17980727</prev>\n<first>17979941</first>\n<last>18023203</last>\n<when>1363781027</when>\n<utime>03/20/13 03:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
