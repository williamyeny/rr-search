This would be especially true if you were simultaneously cold shocking them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should assume it's cubes unless specified otherwise and you DON'T cold shock cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm wondering why the casing layer is dried out.  You should be misting several times per day to keep it nice and moist.  You can also pour water right from a bottle between the pins to super-hydrate the casing.   If the substrate is also dry, as I suspect, you can inject water directly into it with a syringe, and/or pour water around the edges of the tray, filling it up.  Pour off the excess a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6784360</next>\n<prev>6783438</prev>\n<first>6783318</first>\n<last>6785316</last>\n<when>1176496862</when>\n<utime>04/13/07 11:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
