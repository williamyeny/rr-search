Sporeworks sells agar for mycological use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agar should be used to inocuate grains under sterile conditions.  The reason is the mycelium colonizes the surface of the agar, so if you use it to inoculate a bulk substrate, the other side of the agar is likely to contaminate before the mycelium has time to 'jump off' to the bulk substrate.  In addition, the very thin layer of mycelium on a petri dish has a hard time jumping off to anything but sterile media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By inoculating grains, they will colonize all the way around the kernel, then the grains can remain viable until the mycelium can get established into the bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pan cyans grow great outdoors if you're in a suitable climate.  They'll also grow in a non-suitable climate provided it gets warm enough during the summer, but they will need to be spawned again each year because they won't survive the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6656087</next>\n<prev>6655541</prev>\n<first>6650400</first>\n<last>6662894</last>\n<when>1173552979</when>\n<utime>03/10/07 08:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
