{"key":"post-8550012","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8550012</id>\n<content>Honey is also mediocre.&amp;nbsp; However, as said above the biggest problem with amateur growers LC is starting from spores.&amp;nbsp; Sporeprints are notoriously contaminated with whatever is floating in the indoor environment, and that's a lot of stuff, mostly shed human skin cells that are crawling with bacteria and whatever mold spores hitched a ride as they floated in the air.&amp;nbsp; Pf cakes are somewhat selective against these contaminants and grains a bit less so.&amp;nbsp; LC and agar will grow whatever is present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growers have used glucose before with limited success.&amp;nbsp; I've also seen them inject sealed bottles of fruit juice.&amp;nbsp; Gas exchange can be provided by using a dab of silicone sealant above the liquid line, and then injecting a polyfill stuffed syringe body through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend against new growers using LC.&amp;nbsp; For every grower who gets good results, three or four will fail due to natural contaminants, and you never know what you have for weeks until you use the culture to inject grains or cakes.&amp;nbsp; However, skip the LC and you find out much sooner if your projects are contaminated.&amp;nbsp; In addition, grains and cakes grow mycelium much faster than the sugar water contraptions we read about here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8549962</prev>\n<first>8549765</first>\n<last>8550012</last>\n<when>1214140642</when>\n<utime>06/22/08 04:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
