More isn't better.  A flow hood is not 100% effecient.  At 99.9%, that extra air blowing through that you don't need brings with it quite a bit of nasties.  .001% of 300,000 particles of contaminant spore per cubic foot of air is a LOT of nasty stuff getting through.  I'd at least block off part of the intake to slow down the air.  You'll still need a picture of the data plate if you want the 'for sure' way to wire it.  Grainger used to have that info on their website, but I can't find it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 240 volt operation you wire the windings in series, and for 120 volt operation, you connect them in parallel, so it's important to have the diagram.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6665586</next>\n<prev>6661324</prev>\n<first>6658814</first>\n<last>6666845</last>\n<when>1173728558</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
