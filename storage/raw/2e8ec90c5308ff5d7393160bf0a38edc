That's why experienced growers say a cube is a cube.  It's because they're all different.  None are noticably better than any other on a continuing basis.  All can be extremely good, or poor.  It's a roll of the dice with multispore inoculation.   That's why we isolate strains to single sectors.  Any 'strain' can be isolated down to a great fruiting strain with all the qualities one seeks, thus a cube IS a cube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This belongs in the strain thread.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7127841</next>\n<prev>7127800</prev>\n<first>7125383</first>\n<last>7127841</last>\n<when>1183559630</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 05:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
