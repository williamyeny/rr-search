Then take that new print and then create a new series of isolates.&amp;nbsp; Pick the best one (2nd generation).&amp;nbsp; Fruit it.&amp;nbsp; Take a print from the new isolate.&amp;nbsp; Do isolates again from that print.&amp;nbsp; Find the best one (3rd generation) So on and so on.&amp;nbsp; Would the resulting print say from the 20th generation have a narrow set of genetics prone to certain characteristics you had been selecting for than the original print from which the first isolate was taken? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8563671</next>\n<prev>8562502</prev>\n<first>8553044</first>\n<last>8564544</last>\n<when>1214421427</when>\n<utime>06/25/08 10:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
