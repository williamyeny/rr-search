However, in terms of trying to adhere to a proper sense of cultivating, should I aim to use the spawn before it gets to that point? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, just shake and use when it's ready.&amp;nbsp; The bruising is normal and doesn't hurt the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; There's more bluing with cell-lines such as penis envy which are naturally high in psilocin.&amp;nbsp; This is also why PE is so much better fresh, while non-bluing strains are as good dry as fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other non-active mushrooms such as some boletes which also bruise blue, so it just shows our understanding of mushrooms is still a work in progress.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>19277185</prev>\n<first>19274755</first>\n<last>19278101</last>\n<when>1387118998</when>\n<utime>12/15/13 04:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
