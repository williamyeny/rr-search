If you meant to say isolated &lt;i&gt;strain&lt;/i&gt;, that isn't how it's done.  You want to isolate many strains so you can fruit them independently to find the best performer.  That means starting from spores, then isolating the various zones of separate growth that appear on the petri dish away from each other, so that each can grow out on its own dish.  Don't use peroxide.  Instead, use sterile procedure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5962087</next>\n<prev>5961934</prev>\n<first>5961917</first>\n<last>5962550</last>\n<when>1155567955</when>\n<utime>08/14/06 06:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
