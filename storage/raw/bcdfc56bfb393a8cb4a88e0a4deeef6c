They're most likely breeding in your houseplants, then the adults emerge and go looking for a new place to nest. I've seen fungus gnats for years around my grows, but don't freak out anymore over them.  I've honestly never gotten a contamination I could positively blame on them.  Another option is the habenero pepper spray insecticide you can get at hydro stores.  It kills them dead, but only affects the gnats.  You'll still have to find the houseplant they're coming from and take care of the larvae.  In the short term, you can set the larvae back by puttng the houseplant in a five gallon bucket of water, so that the water level is a couple of inches above the flowerpot.  If the entire soil mass is underwater for two days, it will knock out most of them.
