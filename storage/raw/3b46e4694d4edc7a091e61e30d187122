As said, you soak for bacteria, not molds.  If it turned green without opening, then plain and simple, your filter is not doing its job.  Look for tears.  Is it post office tyvek?  If so, that could be the problem.  I don't consider it suitable for mycology.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, there's no voodoo.  Examine the filter and jar very carefully.  I'm sure you'll find a crack in the glass, or a tear in the tyvek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other possibility is if you speed cooled the jars.  The rapid shrinking of the contents could have drawn air from the outside quicker than the filter could have prevented contaminants from entering.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7095835</next>\n<prev>7095444</prev>\n<first>7095086</first>\n<last>7099289</last>\n<when>1182898628</when>\n<utime>06/27/07 01:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
