Motor speed in an AC motor is determined by the 60hz frequency of the line, not the voltage or current. Motor speed controllers vary the frequency, not the voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With DC motors such as you have, speed is controlled by the amount of current that passes through the windings.  Thus, you can use a rheostat in series with the supply, or a lower voltage power source.  For example, you could run that 12 volt motor on 6 volts to reduce speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mechanical method to reduce flow is to block off part of the air intake.  By starving the unit for air, less air is moved, therefore less work is done, and the amount of current used naturally drops.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7621840</next>\n<prev>7619861</prev>\n<first>7619712</first>\n<last>7621882</last>\n<when>1194746884</when>\n<utime>11/11/07 04:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
