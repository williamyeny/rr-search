{"key":"post-7429356","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7429356</id>\n<content>I've found absolutely no correlation between substrate and potency.  If the substrate can support the flush, it can support potency as well.   Potency is genetic, thus with multispore inoculation, you'll get a different substrain every time, and that's why potency varies project to project.  It's the substrain, not the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cased rye can do great.  I prefer to spawn to manure, but you can get to your flush sooner by simply casing your rye.  Perhaps you forgot to patch?  That would lead to only a few mushrooms, but they'd be monsters.  I prefer lots of small fruits myself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7430277</next>\n<prev>7429281</prev>\n<first>7421335</first>\n<last>7431498</last>\n<when>1190247592</when>\n<utime>09/20/07 03:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
