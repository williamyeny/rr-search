{"key":"post-4760333","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4760333</id>\n<content>Light has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  I expose all jars to light from day one.  I also incubate on a shelf in an open room at room temperature.  If you visit fungi perfecti, you'll see that stamets has 10,000 square feet of incubation area, all of it exposed to fluorescent lights for 8 to 10 hours per day.  He no longer recommends incubation in total darkness as he did 20 years ago when he wrote TMC.  I concur.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4762471</next>\n<prev>4760264</prev>\n<first>4759814</first>\n<last>24020173</last>\n<when>1128561102</when>\n<utime>10/06/05 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
