Don't forget to buy a 1/2&quot; romex connector to fit into the nickel sized hole you'll punch out to get the wire into the box.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8729352</next>\n<prev>8729340</prev>\n<first>8729242</first>\n<last>8729526</last>\n<when>1217967983</when>\n<utime>08/05/08 11:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
