A fluorescent lamp or indirect sunlight is plenty of light. But basically any kind of visible light will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A source with a wide spectrum of light, especially containing lots of bluish light (natural daylight or white fluorescent lights are very good examples of light with lots of blue) is best, but a low wattage incandescent light (25 watts is plenty) not too close to the terrarium will work well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yep so outdated it not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use an incandescent lamp.&amp;nbsp; They're around 3,000K and not nearly as effective as a fluorescent or LED at 6500K.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14913538</next>\n<prev>14913054</prev>\n<first>14912300</first>\n<last>14913538</last>\n<when>1313207876</when>\n<utime>08/13/11 06:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
