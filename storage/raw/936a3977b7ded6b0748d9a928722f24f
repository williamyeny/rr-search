Pour, then reinsert them back into the sleeve and seal it up.  If you have a flow hood, make sure to inflate the plastic sleeve with air from the hood.  I still make it a point to use them all within ten days or so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4228583</prev>\n<first>4227604</first>\n<last>4228656</last>\n<when>1117257804</when>\n<utime>05/28/05 08:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
