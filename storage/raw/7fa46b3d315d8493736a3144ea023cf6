Having a lower BE in such a case doesn't make the bulk sub grow lesser, since it's almost just a circumstantial number.&amp;nbsp; It's lower because a dry substrate material is used to apply necessary water.&lt;br /&gt;This is why I prefer to focus on the grains alone when calculating BE for grows like these.&amp;nbsp; It makes the number applicable and meaningful at face value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is flat-out wrong.&amp;nbsp; First of all, wtf is A-tek?&amp;nbsp; I've never heard of it.&amp;nbsp; Teks should be named after what they do.&amp;nbsp; We don't use 'A' for anything so don't need a tek for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, bulk substrates supply food for the mycelium.&amp;nbsp;  They are not used to 'apply water'.&amp;nbsp; The casing layer you're putting over grains serves that purpose, but you're conveniently leaving that out of BE calculations, skewing the number in favor of straight grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you're also wrong about bulk substrates always having a lower BE.&amp;nbsp; I've seen straw deliver over 1000% BE, with 500% being average.&amp;nbsp; On the cover of my DVD is a first flush of over 10 pounds of mushrooms from less than one pound of straw.&amp;nbsp; That basket fruited again and again for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To claim in earlier posts that cased grains are higher potency than bulk substrates is over the top.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium doesn't lose its vigor or potency when it's given a larger, more diverse substrate.&amp;nbsp; If you doubt this, try to eat only one food item for a few months and see how you feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You talked above about the energy costs to pasteurize bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; This cost pales in comparison to the cost of sterilizing grains at a much higher temperature, which is considerably more expensive and time consuming.&amp;nbsp; If it was not, commercial farms would all be using cased grains, since these procedures have been around for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is cased grains are fine and perform well.&amp;nbsp; Bulk substrates are fine and perform well.&amp;nbsp; BRF tek is fine and performs well. Each grower has a different set of conditions to deal with, so there are procedures to fit various circumstances.&amp;nbsp; None are 'better' than any other.&amp;nbsp; If I tried to run my shiitake farm on cased grains, I'd have gone bankrupt by now.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19603111</next>\n<prev>19602874</prev>\n<first>19414571</first>\n<last>19905237</last>\n<when>1393077905</when>\n<utime>02/22/14 04:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
