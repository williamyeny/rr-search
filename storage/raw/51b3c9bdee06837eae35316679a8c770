Sterilize the contaminated jars in a pot of boiling water for an hour before opening to dump the crap out.  Wash the jars with soap and water and they're fine to re-use.  Remember, you're going to sterilize after you load fresh substrate.  Mold spores are killed by temperatures far below boiling, so you're safe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7989299</prev>\n<first>7988239</first>\n<last>7991573</last>\n<when>1202413687</when>\n<utime>02/07/08 09:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
