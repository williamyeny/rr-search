{"key":"post-7556767","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7556767</id>\n<content>Six to seven inches of substrate is too much, provided the species is cubensis.  There is little to be gained by going over three or four inches of substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shouldn't have fanned at all during colonization.  The increased air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grain jars can be colonized in light or dark, but bulk substrates should be kept in the dark as much as possible during colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure the above is why they're pinning now.  I'd just expose to fruiting conditions at this point and let them go.  Don't expect much, but you'll get some fruits.  Next time, follow normal procedures.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7559696</next>\n<prev>7556436</prev>\n<first>7555527</first>\n<last>7559696</last>\n<when>1193278198</when>\n<utime>10/25/07 05:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
