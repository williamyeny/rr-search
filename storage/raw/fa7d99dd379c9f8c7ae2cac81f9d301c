If the casing layer has mold, toss it out.  If the fruits were mold free, they're fine to eat.   In the future, don't try to cut out 'green mold' as you only spread it, making the problem worse.  In addition, trichoderma spores are quite sticky, so they stick to you, the walls, the floor, etc., and then come back later to haunt you in your future grows.  Always toss out moldy substrates on first sight.  Bury them into a hole with some horse or cow manure outdoors and they'll often recover and fruit in a natural environment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7086354</next>\n<prev>7085917</prev>\n<first>7085917</first>\n<last>7086354</last>\n<when>1182692226</when>\n<utime>06/24/07 04:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
