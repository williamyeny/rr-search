You have a lot to learn. Bacteria smells, molds don't unless you know what you're smelling for.  Look at the bottom right of the forum page, where it says Pages 1 2 3 4 . . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the last fifty pages and after you have, ask what you dont understand.  This has gone on long enough.  In the time you've spent typing and arguing with those who would help you, while showing how little you know, you could have read all fifty pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your first mistake was ordering a syringe from a non-shroomery approved sponsor.  In this thread, you've exposed many, many more mistakes.  Get to reading.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6636004</prev>\n<first>6635109</first>\n<last>6636010</last>\n<when>1173072214</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 07:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
