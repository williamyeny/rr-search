There's far better ways to expand mycelium much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you don't 'case' the bottom.&amp;nbsp; A casing layer goes on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fungus gnats are fairly easy to get rid of.&amp;nbsp; First, get rid of the houseplants they're breeding in.&amp;nbsp; Second, put out nearly empty red wine bottles with only an inch or so of wine in the bottom.&amp;nbsp; Gnats fly in, and can't get out.&amp;nbsp; If you don't want to toss the houseplants, Google &lt;i&gt;BT for fungus gnats&lt;/i&gt; and treat the plant soil with it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8565695</next>\n<prev>8565656</prev>\n<first>8408771</first>\n<last>8567830</last>\n<when>1214486283</when>\n<utime>06/26/08 04:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
