I went through at least ten cool mists per year until I set them INside the greenhouse, and I'm on the same two coolmists for nearly two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, put your stuff in.  Don't sweat the temperature.  It's normal for the mist to drop the temp as the humidity comes up by evaporative cooling, much like a swamp cooler works in the desert.  The temp will equalize with the room soon.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6353282</next>\n<prev>6353269</prev>\n<first>6352916</first>\n<last>6364450</last>\n<when>1165753619</when>\n<utime>12/10/06 02:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
