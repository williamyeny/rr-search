And if I do decide to use poo, where can I get the &quot;organic&quot; one or &quot;no smell' one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break a bad habit before you get started.&amp;nbsp; It is MANURE.&amp;nbsp; Poo is baby talk for what ends up in a diaper and we require people to be 18 to register here.&amp;nbsp; I can't believe the mentality of so-called adults who could type the word poo with a straight face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get field aged horse manure from a local horse owner.&amp;nbsp; Pick up the dry nuggets in the field which have been exposed to sun and rain for a few months, but are not composted. There will be no smell other than a slight earthy scent.&amp;nbsp; You might find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Horse-Manure-Substrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;horse manure prep tek&lt;/a&gt; helpful.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16060453</next>\n<prev>16060359</prev>\n<first>16052853</first>\n<last>16074126</last>\n<when>1333900719</when>\n<utime>04/08/12 06:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
