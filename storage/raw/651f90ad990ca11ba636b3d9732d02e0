The consensus throughout the thread was that twisting and pulling is the correct way to harvest, because cutting at the base has the potential to cause contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a myth spread by people with no experience whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Bad info like that is the reason we had to come up with the &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/8903929#8903929&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trusted cultivator tag&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If the mushrooms are loose and about to fall over, it doesn't do much damage to twist and pull.&amp;nbsp; If they're firmly attached, you'll pull a chunk of substrate out with the base, and this WILL be a site for mold to get started.&amp;nbsp; Slice fruits off at the base with a sharp knife.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16145133</next>\n<prev>16145067</prev>\n<first>16144683</first>\n<last>16145241</last>\n<when>1335504281</when>\n<utime>04/27/12 08:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
