I don't think I've ever picked an oyster off a log in the forest that didn't also have green mold growing on the same log.  It's everywhere.  Harvest the fruits and toss out the cake.  Never leave a contaminated cake in your growing area or house.  Bury it outdoors in a manure bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also a chance the fruit was damaged and it was just bruised.  Some strains bruise more green than blue.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6993956</next>\n<prev>6989890</prev>\n<first>6989890</first>\n<last>7028201</last>\n<when>1180626302</when>\n<utime>05/31/07 06:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
