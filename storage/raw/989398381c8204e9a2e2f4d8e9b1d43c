From what it looks like to me, it seems like the spores are not only shot out the bottom of the cap, but upward through the mushroom flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&amp;nbsp; They're not penetrating the mushroom flesh.&amp;nbsp; You can see this easily with polypores in the forest.&amp;nbsp; They're as tough and woody as the trees they're attached to, yet the tops of the conks are covered in spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13086011</next>\n<prev>13084992</prev>\n<first>13080659</first>\n<last>20834204</last>\n<when>1282458813</when>\n<utime>08/22/10 09:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
