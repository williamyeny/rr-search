You only cause the green spores to become airborne and spread.  I'd suggest moving it outdoors to finish up.  Next grow, be sure to provide more air exchange.  Trich thrives in stale, still air.  Also as said, adding lime will help as most contaminants of mushroom culture prefer a low ph, while mushroom mycelium can tolerate a higher ph.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4729724</next>\n<prev>4724048</prev>\n<first>4723843</first>\n<last>4729724</last>\n<when>1127919033</when>\n<utime>09/28/05 05:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
