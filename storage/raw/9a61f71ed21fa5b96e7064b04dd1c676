This causes a loss of moisture from the substrate, which is the main pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; It simply means everything is working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can obtain CO2 detectors to verify your fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; Shoot for a level less than 1000 ppm during fruiting if you're making changes, or trying to set up a new design.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;follow the tek&lt;/a&gt; and your CO2 levels will be in the 500 ppm to 1000 ppm range.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12330538</next>\n<prev>12329765</prev>\n<first>12327210</first>\n<last>12371783</last>\n<when>1270418093</when>\n<utime>04/05/10 12:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
