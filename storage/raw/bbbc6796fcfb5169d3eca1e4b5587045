{"key":"post-24966328","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>24966328</id>\n<content>I started a wavy cap patch ten years ago by inoculating grains with mycelium, then transferring to a mix of sterilized alder/douglas fir sawdust in a shit ton of spawn bags.&amp;nbsp; These were colonized over the winter, and then used to inoculate several truckloads of alder sawdust and chips the following spring.&amp;nbsp; They fruited that year during the rainy season after the first spell of freezing temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patches will migrate over time.&amp;nbsp; Mine is now nearly a half mile from the original location, which stopped fruiting a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you're close to the coast, they won't fruit every year.&amp;nbsp; Mine often just start to pin, then get covered by a foot of snow. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:tongue:&quot; title=&quot;:tongue:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>24976377</next>\n<prev>24966223</prev>\n<first>24965726</first>\n<last>24976727</last>\n<when>1517757368</when>\n<utime>02/04/18 05:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
