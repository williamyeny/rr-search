Decaf seems to work just as well, while caffeine pills, that were added had no noticable effect on the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct.&amp;nbsp; There's over 200 compounds in coffee and nobody knows which of them, or if it's a combination of all of them that does the trick.&amp;nbsp; Many growers have tried pure caffeine with no result, and decaf works well too.&amp;nbsp;  I suspect it may be something as simple as the lower pH, because I've had similar results adding citrus juice to substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn't to say there might be something in cocoa that will work.&amp;nbsp; Give it a try and let us know what you find.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11882459</next>\n<prev>11879222</prev>\n<first>11876626</first>\n<last>11883433</last>\n<when>1264197655</when>\n<utime>01/23/10 12:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
