I've found that very bright light will help to trigger a better pinset, but just keep it out of the direct sunlight.  There's no need to drape a towel or anything else over your terrarium.  They can get light off and on in a normal room setting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5495270</next>\n<prev>5493170</prev>\n<first>5493043</first>\n<last>5495270</last>\n<when>1144537281</when>\n<utime>04/09/06 02:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
