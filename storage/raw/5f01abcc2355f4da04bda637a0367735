You don't want to count the time until the steam is escaping from under the tight fitting lid.&amp;nbsp; If you're counting from when the water first boils, that's the problem.&amp;nbsp; It takes half an hour or so after the water boils before the surface of the jars is up to 100C/212F, and it won't be until after then that steam escapes from under the lid of the steamer.&amp;nbsp; Count 90 minutes from that point.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're still getting contamination after the above, then your verm filter is shifting.&amp;nbsp; Get proper jars and fill them all the way to the top so the dry verm filter can't shift.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10300522</next>\n<prev>10299728</prev>\n<first>10272973</first>\n<last>10464704</last>\n<when>1241677206</when>\n<utime>05/07/09 09:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
