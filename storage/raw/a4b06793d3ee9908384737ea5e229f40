I start my grains in December, and use them to inoculate sawdust/woodchip bags in January.  Give the sawdust/woodchip bags two months to colonize fully, and then use them to spawn to moistened woodchips in an outdoor bed in March.  Cover with an inch of topsoil, and a bit of straw or cardboard to protect against any late freezes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7690979</next>\n<prev>7626179</prev>\n<first>7624374</first>\n<last>7690979</last>\n<when>1194906621</when>\n<utime>11/13/07 12:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
