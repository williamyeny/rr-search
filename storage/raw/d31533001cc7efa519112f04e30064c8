I haven't really understood yet, why some people think it's a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because dumping the pressure overwhelms the weave of the filters, opening it up so contaminants can enter.&amp;nbsp; This has been known for a very long time is exactly the reason you should never lift the weight to dump pressure.(the other reason is ruined moisture content)&amp;nbsp; Your bacteria contaminated grains are simply another confirmation of why you should never do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss out any filters you have used when popping the weight and start over next time with new ones, following proper procedure.&amp;nbsp; If you need to sterilize more jars, pony up for a larger pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; Use 90 minutes, and don't forget to leave the weight off for the first several minutes to allow all the air to escape and be replaced by steam before building pressure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15144188</next>\n<prev>15142996</prev>\n<first>15126492</first>\n<last>15388346</last>\n<when>1317170646</when>\n<utime>09/28/11 03:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
