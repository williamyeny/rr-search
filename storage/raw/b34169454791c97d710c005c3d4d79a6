{"key":"post-6821375","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6821375</id>\n<content>I've dunked cakes and even bulk substrates many times with pins on them. In fact, I've had a pan stipticus sawdust/woodchip block with hundreds of pins dunking all evening this very day.  They usually double in size overnight during the dunk.  I've never seen a pin abort from dunking, provided you allow plenty of air exchange after the dunk, so they can dry off over the first hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6822210</next>\n<prev>6821296</prev>\n<first>6772496</first>\n<last>6822210</last>\n<when>1177306824</when>\n<utime>04/23/07 08:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
