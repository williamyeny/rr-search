I regularly add wheat or rice bran to sawdust blocks, but they get pressure cooked. If you want an extra push, just use a higher spawn ratio.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, so that's a big part of what makes coffee so good.&amp;nbsp; Don't lime or otherwise adjust the pH.&amp;nbsp; I've never seen them 'add' lime to gypsum.&amp;nbsp; Are you sure you're not just seeing 'calcium' in the ingredients?&amp;nbsp; Gypsum is calcium sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11045848</next>\n<prev>11044842</prev>\n<first>11043268</first>\n<last>11048215</last>\n<when>1252770675</when>\n<utime>09/12/09 06:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
