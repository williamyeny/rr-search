Sealing them up with plastic or in a container can cause the dry verm filter to get damp, ruining its effectiveness.  I strongly dislike 'incubators'.  I'd suggest a high bookshelf or on top of a cabinet.  It's always warmer near the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8339702</next>\n<prev>8339628</prev>\n<first>8339303</first>\n<last>8339753</last>\n<when>1209441052</when>\n<utime>04/29/08 06:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
