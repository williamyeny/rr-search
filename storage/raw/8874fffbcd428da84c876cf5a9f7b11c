The 70% takes too long to dry off my gloves or table when I wash them with it.  I mix equal amounts of 91% and 70%.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5720007</next>\n<prev>5717805</prev>\n<first>5714336</first>\n<last>5720007</last>\n<when>1149598627</when>\n<utime>06/06/06 03:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
