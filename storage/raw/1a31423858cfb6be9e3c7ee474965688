The 2008 US farm bill provided for significant grants for innovative green farming technique development.&amp;nbsp; I built this underground so it would require no heat in winter or cooling in summer.&amp;nbsp; The air exchange system is passive, requiring no fans or other energy consuming equipment.&amp;nbsp; The humidification system is also passive, with rocks lining the floor, which will be sprayed with water twice a day.&amp;nbsp; The lighting is LED and will only amount to a few dollars per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've had grant writers out here over the summer from the USDA and from our State Department of Agriculture.&amp;nbsp; They're waiting to see actual mushrooms coming out in order to quantify the production possibilities, and then they want to talk about grants to help people build mom and pop mushroom farms all over, using this plan as the basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The State Department of Natural Resources is getting me hardwood chips from overgrown areas that are being thinned for fire prevention.&amp;nbsp; I've found a source for organic barley straw, and am getting 200 bales delivered the first week of January.&amp;nbsp; I should realistically be turning out about 40 to 60 pounds per day if my calculations work out.&amp;nbsp; It won't get us rich, but it's a living and shows what can be done by only two people without a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also fits into the new model for 'green agriculture' by growing local mushrooms on local waste material for the local market, thus avoiding the use of fossil fuels hauling products across country on trucks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11681922</next>\n<prev>11681905</prev>\n<first>11681761</first>\n<last>13673392</last>\n<when>1261266142</when>\n<utime>12/20/09 01:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
