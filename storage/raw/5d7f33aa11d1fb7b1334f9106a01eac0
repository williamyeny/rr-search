I don't recommend LC unless one has a good microscope to check for bacillus before inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no such thing as a 'clean' spoon unless it's been flame sterilized.  The correct way to do g2g is to bang the fully colonized jar against a tire to break up each individual kernel.  Then, you can simply pour and twist the donor jar as you pour the grains into the receiving jar without ever touching them.  Always use a glovebox or flowhood.  Never allow an uncolonized jar to be open for more than five seconds, so you have to work fast and deliberately.  Plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use latex gloves that have been washed in alcohol after putting them on.  If using a flow hood, wear a face mask and hair net.  Be freshly showered and put on clean cotton clothes.  If using a glovebox, the above isn't necessary, but make sure anything that comes near an open jar is very clean.  Make sure the glovebox is sealed up so no drafts occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it's also possible that your donor jar was contaminated, so be sure to look at all the angles to determine what happened.  You can narrow down the problem by using blanks at every stage.  Keep back a jar that you don't g2g into.  If it contaminates, look at your sterilization process.  Coffee filters are useless for mycology.  Trying to stop contaminants with a coffee filter is like trying to catch a mosquito in a butterfly net.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5807769</prev>\n<first>5803844</first>\n<last>5809229</last>\n<when>1151768325</when>\n<utime>07/01/06 06:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
