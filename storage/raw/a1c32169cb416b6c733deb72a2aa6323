Remove the foil covering when you remove from the pressure cooker so the tyvek or other material can dry out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a commercially purchased synthetic filter disk gets wet, as with any other filter material, bacterial contaminants can colonize right through the filter to reach your media below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stirrer does two things with a properly made liquid culture.  First it keeps the liquid aerated.  Second, it prevents the fragmeted mycelium from re-knitting together.  You want hundreds, or even thousands of tiny fragments of mycelium, not a single organism which is hard to draw into a syringe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7769359</next>\n<prev>7768999</prev>\n<first>7761658</first>\n<last>7773616</last>\n<when>1197915641</when>\n<utime>12/17/07 08:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
