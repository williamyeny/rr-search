You can pour some water on the top of the cake into the divot left by the shape of the jar.  Fill that up, and within a few hours it will absorb into the mycelium.  Repeat daily for a few days and your fruits will grow much larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discoloration is metabolites, not &lt;i&gt;piss&lt;/i&gt; which mushrooms don't make.  Before and after dunking, rinse the cakes under the faucet to remove anything that will wash off.  I'd suggest reading up on 'dunk and roll'.  Having a layer of verm on the outside of the cakes gives you something to mist daily, and then the verm will hold the moisture as a reservoir for the mycelium to draw from.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7558455</next>\n<prev>7557841</prev>\n<first>7557828</first>\n<last>21477702</last>\n<when>1193323297</when>\n<utime>10/25/07 05:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
