The fruits are fine if the mold is on the other side of the cake.  I'd take it outside before removing from the pmp, then harvest the mushrooms and bury the rest in a shady spot outdoors.  You might get a surprise later this summer.  Be sure to wash your hands and clothes right away after handling moldy cakes or substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6654160</next>\n<prev>6654148</prev>\n<first>6654134</first>\n<last>6654255</last>\n<when>1173497234</when>\n<utime>03/10/07 05:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
