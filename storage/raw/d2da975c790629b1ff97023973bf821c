{"key":"post-7752671","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7752671</id>\n<content>There should be ZERO standing water in the perlite.  Having standing water relegates that perlite that is underwater useless.  Rinse the perlite, drain well, and then place into the terrarium.  Three to five inches of well drained perlite will deliver 95% humidity, provided you've drilled those small holes into all six sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation on the sides of a terrarium is not an indication of humidity.  A calibrated hygrometer gives an accurate indication of humidity.  Don't try to grow without one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7752494</prev>\n<first>7752431</first>\n<last>7752671</last>\n<when>1197552812</when>\n<utime>12/13/07 03:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
