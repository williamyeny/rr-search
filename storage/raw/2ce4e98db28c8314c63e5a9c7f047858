You can usually lift an entire substrate out of the container with one hand and it doesn't break.  Dunk after this flush, but Just keep it in fruiting conditions and let it go.  They'll fruit fine at 65F, but 70 to 75 is better.  Next time, don't incubate at 86F.  It's too hot.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6358634</prev>\n<first>6356726</first>\n<last>6358681</last>\n<when>1165886074</when>\n<utime>12/12/06 03:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
