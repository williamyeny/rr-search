If you look at a coffee filter through a microscope, you'll see right through the holes to the stage below. It won't matter how many coffee filters you stack up.  Use tyvek, polyfil or synthetic filter disks.  Coffee filters make a nice dust catcher, but that's about all they're good for.  I don't use them even for that, since a bit of dust on the regular filter doesn't hurt anything.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5996289</next>\n<prev>5996261</prev>\n<first>5996261</first>\n<last>5996331</last>\n<when>1156537901</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 11:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
