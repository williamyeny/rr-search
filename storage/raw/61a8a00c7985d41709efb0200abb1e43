Well it colonized my wbs quart jars in about four days, and I just mixed my spawn with my bulk sub yesterday afternoon and I am already casing it now, hopefully I will start fruitng tomorrow. By the way I used about a quart and a half of spawn for 3cubic feet of coir/coffee/compost sub. So thats like a 1:3 ratio, I usually yeild several solid ounces if not a half pound over all the flushes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but that sounds like mold.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium doesn't grow that fast, and I have some pretty nice isolated strains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9800194</next>\n<prev>9800171</prev>\n<first>9799853</first>\n<last>9860753</last>\n<when>1234680716</when>\n<utime>02/15/09 08:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
