You'll notice the colonies are circular in shape.  That's one of the biggest telltale signs.  Another is the serrated edges around the leading edge.  The green is also a much lighter color, indicating Aspergillus contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's extremely important to keep your filter dry and free of grain 'juice' at all times.  That's why I drill four holes in each lid, 1/16&quot; in diameter.  That sized hole is smaller than the kernel size, so when I shake the jars, no grains ever come in contact with the filter.  Some growers also leave the foil on, which causes the filter to get wet with condensation.  This also leads to contamination, so be sure to remove the foil as soon as the jars are removed from the pressure cooker.  Your wbs in that picture is way too wet, so that's probably how your filter got wet, which then allowed it to colonize right through with the mold.  I don't see a hole in the filter, but that's also a possibility, but it's much more likely a wet filter caused it or the filter itself wouldn't have grown the mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drill holes through ten jar lids at once, but the difference is a much smaller drill bit, and I make sure it's sharp, and don't press down too hard.   That way, no burrs are created.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6936026</next>\n<prev>6929855</prev>\n<first>6923658</first>\n<last>27218916</last>\n<when>1179536402</when>\n<utime>05/19/07 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
