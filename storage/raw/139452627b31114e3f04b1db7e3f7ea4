{"key":"post-6837239","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6837239</id>\n<content>You've got it completely backwards.  Heat lowers humidity.  Leave the cap off for air exchange and keep it out of direct sun.  That's a poor choice of a fruiting chamber because it's hard for air to circulate, and also there's no way to put a hygrometer inside, so you don't know what your humidity is.  If it's cut in the middle where the tape is, I'd unwrap that tape so air can circulate from there as well.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6837247</next>\n<prev>6837006</prev>\n<first>6836644</first>\n<last>6839212</last>\n<when>1177620864</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 11:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
