If the bags were rolled up tight for sterization, they need to be filled with sterile air before inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filter patch bags should look like this after filling.  The bags on the bottom shelf are fully colonized, top shelf bags were made up yesterday.  Note the plenum of air above the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-39/931565261-Filter_patch_bags_a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-39/931565261-thumb_Filter_patch_bags_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6107933</next>\n<prev>6104193</prev>\n<first>6097810</first>\n<last>6112323</last>\n<when>1159315710</when>\n<utime>09/27/06 03:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
