My experience with fruit flies and gnats is they are there to munch on your mycelium, but don't use the substrate to breed in because it's too packed and dense.  It's kinda fun to use the vacuum cleaner hose to suck them up.  Put a flea and tick collar for dogs in the vacuum cleaner bag to make sure they croak when they get there and don't crawl back out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5829151</next>\n<prev>5826760</prev>\n<first>5826760</first>\n<last>5829151</last>\n<when>1152206429</when>\n<utime>07/06/06 08:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
