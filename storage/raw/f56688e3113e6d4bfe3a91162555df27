We all start out shooting for the stars when we can only reach the moon. My point is, by doing research instead of trying new things without proper knowledge. this can easily be curbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is flat-out incorrect, and when inexperienced people constantly repeat bad info like that it only screws up other new growers who are searching for correct answers.&amp;nbsp; The idea that spores are 'strains' is not rooted in mycology, but rather in marketing to former pot growers who are used to names such as 'blueberry', 'kush', 'white widow', etc., actually meaning something.&amp;nbsp; Comparing the moon to stars, or apples to oranges, makes as much sense as comparing spores to strains.&amp;nbsp; It just ain't so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15369436</next>\n<prev>15368790</prev>\n<first>15368560</first>\n<last>15376000</last>\n<when>1321303347</when>\n<utime>11/14/11 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
