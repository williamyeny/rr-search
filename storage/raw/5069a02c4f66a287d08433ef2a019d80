Don't sterilize casing mix unless you live in an area with a very low contaminant spore load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Rabbit and I were in the forest today with trees that were totally covered with trichoderma.  The stuff gets on our clothes, our hair, everything, then we bring it back home with us.  If I were to sterilize a casing layer, it wouldn't last a week without turning green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pasteurize, air exchange is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, trichoderma loves wood substrates.  My shiitake and oyster woodchip blocks get it all the time, but with wood based substrates it's only on the surface and can be nuked with a q-tip dipped into a salt paste.  An alternative is to wash the substrate blocks under the faucet every day, which also prevents trich.  Of course, none of the above will help a casing layer.  I suggest harvesting the fruits the second you see green in a casing, then throwing the tray out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6196177</next>\n<prev>6195416</prev>\n<first>6194157</first>\n<last>6196531</last>\n<when>1161482627</when>\n<utime>10/22/06 05:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
