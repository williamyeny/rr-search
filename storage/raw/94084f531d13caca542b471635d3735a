Horse owners are glad to get rid of anything you'll haul off for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a suggestion though.  Knock on the door with a bag and shovel in your hand and ask for some horse &lt;b&gt;manure&lt;/b&gt; for your garden.  If you say 'poo', they'll think you're some kind of little kid and wonder what you're up to.  Manure is for growing mushrooms and/or gardens.  Poo is what babies leave in their diapers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6279917</next>\n<prev>6279856</prev>\n<first>6279663</first>\n<last>6279917</last>\n<when>1163467742</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 03:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
