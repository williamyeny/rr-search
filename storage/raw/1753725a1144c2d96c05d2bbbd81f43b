I put them in two 5 gallon buckets so they would be easy to stir. While I have been stirring them to keep them from molding, it obviously wasn't enough because its starting to mold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will probably freeze it as trying to dry it out seems like a big pain in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumping wet coffee grinds into a five gallon bucket is not the way to dry it out.&amp;nbsp; You should have spread it out on a balcony or porch in the sun to dry.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17040922</next>\n<prev>17040702</prev>\n<first>6189795</first>\n<last>28082494</last>\n<when>1350401264</when>\n<utime>10/16/12 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
