This can happen easily if your substrate shrinks and you handle it, creating an air space between the substrate and its tray. I know guys who cut drain holes in the bottom of their trays also get lots of bottom pinning due to air exchange down there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9757560</next>\n<prev>9756940</prev>\n<first>9756761</first>\n<last>9772528</last>\n<when>1234065007</when>\n<utime>02/08/09 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
