Don't pints colonize faster?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, pints don't colonize faster.  You use slightly more inoculant with a quart jar, so colonization time is the same.  My quart jars of rye berries colonize in a week to ten days with 2 to 4 ml of inoculant, and that's at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're only growing a very small amount, a small PC is great.  Lots of us are experimenting with various species and teks, and therefore go through a lot more spawn, which makes a larger pressure cooker a very good investment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6320704</next>\n<prev>6320655</prev>\n<first>6320448</first>\n<last>6322145</last>\n<when>1164898755</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 04:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
