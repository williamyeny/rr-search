It even has brown, white, and green pieces of paper in it, and is mostly powder.  Just make sure to mix the dry gypsum in with your dry manure or casing mix, then add water.  If you add water first, it sticks to itself, and is hard to mix in.  As wronguy said, it disolves right away.  It's not like pelletized lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6765975</next>\n<prev>6765481</prev>\n<first>6764779</first>\n<last>6766565</last>\n<when>1176148259</when>\n<utime>04/09/07 10:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
