They should look and feel dry, both when mixing and after sterilization.  Dry jars colonize much faster than wet ones.  About the only thing that screws up moisture content is when people pop the weight off at the end of the cycle to let pressure out.  That dries out the inside of the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6852982</prev>\n<first>6852982</first>\n<last>6853048</last>\n<when>1177946068</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 06:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
