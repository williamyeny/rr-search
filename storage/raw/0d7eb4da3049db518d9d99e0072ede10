I'd recommend going to the local cigar shop.  You can get a suitable analog hygrometer for around $15 or less.  Calibrate it by wrapping in a damp towel for half an hour, then unwrap and adjust the screw on the back so the dial reads 98%.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5064509</prev>\n<first>5063946</first>\n<last>5064581</last>\n<when>1134620493</when>\n<utime>12/15/05 06:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
