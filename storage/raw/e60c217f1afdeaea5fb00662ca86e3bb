{"key":"post-11342111","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>11342111</id>\n<content>It's a 115 Volt motor that draws 9 amps.&amp;nbsp; You can use a &lt;i&gt;heavy duty&lt;/i&gt; extension cord with the female end cut off as a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be set up now for counter clockwise rotation.&amp;nbsp; You'll notice on the motor, the orange and brown wires are connected together and the yellow and purple are tied together(or so it appears).&amp;nbsp; Those four wires determine clockwise or counter clockwise rotation per the data plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the plug off the other end of the wires leaving the motor.&amp;nbsp; The browns are for the capacitor and appear to be already hooked up.&amp;nbsp; Tape those so they don't short out on anything.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connect the green wire from your extension cord to a screw on the chassis of the motor or blower. I see there's already a green jumper there to bond the motor to the blower. This is your ground and will ensure the breaker trips in your panel if something shorts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connect the white wire from your cord to the white wire coming from the motor.&amp;nbsp; Connect the black wire from your cord to either the black, blue or red wire, depending if you want high, medium, or low speed respectively. Insulate the two speed wires you don't use so they don't short out.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't use that switch.&amp;nbsp; Once you determine which speed it needs to run, you'll never change it, so just wire it and leave the switch out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're going to want about 500 CFM @ 1&quot; static pressure to go with that 24 X 24 filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11346296</next>\n<prev>11338872</prev>\n<first>11332997</first>\n<last>11347044</last>\n<when>1256788777</when>\n<utime>10/29/09 06:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
