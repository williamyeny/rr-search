We have members here who are constantly researching and trying new experiments, and when those experiments are complete, they post their results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be far more productive to post that you're considering something such as brassinolide and ask if anyone has any information on the topic.&amp;nbsp; Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8885811</next>\n<prev>8885690</prev>\n<first>8883395</first>\n<last>8887891</last>\n<when>1220714299</when>\n<utime>09/06/08 06:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
