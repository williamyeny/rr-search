If you made it any fuller, there wouldn't be room to shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That jar is due to be shaked now to distribute the mycelium.  Shaking at inoculation actually slows down the process.  It's best to wait until the jar looks like yours for the first shake.  You can bang the jar against a tire to break up the kernels to spread them around.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382449</next>\n<prev>6382327</prev>\n<first>6382327</first>\n<last>6383601</last>\n<when>1166456150</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
