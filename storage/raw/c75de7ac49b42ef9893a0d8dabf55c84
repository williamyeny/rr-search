This ensures all the ammonia is out. I like to see the manure get totally dry, then rehydrate to the proper level without soaking or leaching.  Pasteurize in sealed bags or jars after you get the moisture content set.  That way, when they cool, they're ready to use without having to worry about draining, adjusting moisture, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6504550</next>\n<prev>6503006</prev>\n<first>6502609</first>\n<last>6504550</last>\n<when>1169964620</when>\n<utime>01/28/07 08:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
