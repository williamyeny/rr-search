MH has a color temperature of around 4,000K and HPS is around 2000K, but cool white fluorescent is 5,000K and natural daylight fluorescent is 6500K. Regular household light bulbs are around 3000K. The higher the color temperature in Kelvin, the more 'blue' the light is.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6974072</next>\n<prev>6974059</prev>\n<first>6954064</first>\n<last>6974286</last>\n<when>1180302450</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 12:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
