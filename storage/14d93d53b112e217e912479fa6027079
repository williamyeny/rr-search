Quart jars of rye berries should be fully colonized in a week to ten days.  If yours are not, you're either getting them too wet or your LC is contaminated, or you don't make provisions for filtered gas exchange within the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I'll be glad when the current LC fad is over.  They cause way more problems than they solve by people putting untested spores on liquid culture and then using that to inoculate grains.  To make a proper liquid culture, the strain should be cleaned up on agar first to make sure it's pure and contaminant free.  However, if you're going to use agar to clean up the culture, you might as well use a wedge to inoculate grain jars which can then be expanded with grain to grain transfers to exponentially increase the mycelium much faster than LC ever could, unless you have an Eberbach blender and flowhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the point, I grow hundreds of pounds of mushrooms every month, but never make LC's unless it's for demonstration purposes, or to make a mycelium syringe.  However, I make LC from proved strains on agar as opposed to simply squirting spores into sugar water which is going to grow whatever enters, contaminants and all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6283305</next>\n<prev>6281954</prev>\n<first>6281921</first>\n<last>6283305</last>\n<when>1163526389</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 07:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
