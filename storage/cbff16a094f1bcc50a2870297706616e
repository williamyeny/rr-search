If you're using pf tek and followed the directions on boiling, I'll venture a guess to say the mold got in during the inoculation process, or after.  If the mold starts from the inoculation points, that would confirm it.  If your dry verm barrier got wet in the boiling process, the bacteria could have colonized from the holes right through it.  Try to see where it first starts.  That will lead to the solution.<br />RR"}}
