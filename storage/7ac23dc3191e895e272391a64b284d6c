Period. Commercial mushroom farms see green molds on a daily basis and the FDA has made no requirement that those fruits be thrown away.  Aspergillis flavus is NOT a contaminant of mushroom culture, nor is aspergillis parasiticus or penicillium verrucosum.  Aflatoxins certainly are NOT a byproduct of mushroom cultivation.   A mushroom operation is not a moldy house or air vent.  A mushroom farm is not a bag of feed corn that has sat in a damp barn for a year, then eaten raw. Please do not spread disinformation and fear.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5114604</next>\n<prev>5112083</prev>\n<first>5105217</first>\n<last>5114688</last>\n<when>1135774418</when>\n<utime>12/28/05 02:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
