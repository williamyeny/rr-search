Vacuum isn't nearly as strong as pressure, so doesn't pull the plug down as hard as pressure pushes it up. (The plug seals both ways on a sterilizer) Additionally, the toggle valve tends to get crud buildup on the seat over time and will also leak if you don't take it apart regularly to clean.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a flow hood, simply allow the sterilizer or PC to cool in front of it so it doesn't matter if vacuum is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those without flow hoods, you can lay a freshly laundered towel over the lid of the sterilizer or PC as it cools.&amp;nbsp; This will help to trap contaminant spores in the towel so they're not drawn in as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sterilizing agar, you don't want a vacuum since it will cause the still-hot agar to boil over.&amp;nbsp; With agar, lift the toggle as soon as zero pressure is reached.&amp;nbsp; You should have filtering on your agar bottle anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>24173601</next>\n<prev>24171353</prev>\n<first>24170348</first>\n<last>24173601</last>\n<when>1489837049</when>\n<utime>03/18/17 02:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
