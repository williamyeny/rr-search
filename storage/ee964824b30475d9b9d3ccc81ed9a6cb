One time using the PC will not leave much in the way of deposits unless you fail to turn down the stove when pressure is reached.  The only minerals that are left behind are from the water that gets puked out the vent.  If little water escapes the weight, then there will be little buildup of deposits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more free advertising for XXX-mart.  We should be boycotting the bastards, not shopping there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7542954</next>\n<prev>7541873</prev>\n<first>7541136</first>\n<last>7543050</last>\n<when>1192977899</when>\n<utime>10/21/07 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
