The reason is a moist substrate will colonize much faster than a damper one.  I then give a 24 hour dunk before first flush.  You won't go that long with coir though.  Four or five hours should be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6558447</prev>\n<first>6556708</first>\n<last>6559052</last>\n<when>1171324145</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 01:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
