In other words, if your filter is ten inches thick, have at least ten inches behind the filter for pressure to build in.  That area of even pressure behind the filter is how laminar flow is achieved.  Be sure to seal very well around the edges of the filter.  Any unfiltered air that leaks around the edges will ruin your projects.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5278103</next>\n<prev>5277961</prev>\n<first>5277961</first>\n<last>5278490</last>\n<when>1139437777</when>\n<utime>02/09/06 12:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
