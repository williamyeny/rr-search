It's basic physics: The grains are at 250F when at pressure, and when the pressure <i>in the vessel</i> drops to zero, the inside of the glass jars are still at or near 250F, which is why the moisture has to exit the grains very rapidly, resulting in bursting. I wait at least until I can remove the jars without any heat protection for my hands.<br />RR"}}
