However, wear tyvek sleeves and latex gloves.  This will work far better than anything with a fan and filter.  A glovebox needs to have still air to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7163793</next>\n<prev>7162713</prev>\n<first>6903029</first>\n<last>7212177</last>\n<when>1184206904</when>\n<utime>07/12/07 05:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
