The word is often used incorrectly here and repeated endlessly.  I've almost given up on trying to correct people for the misused terms.  'Casing' is not a term to use for a project.  The casing is the layer placed over the substrate to provide moisture and a suitable microclimate for fruiting.<br />It's very important for people to use the correct nomenclature on a site that dispenses information.<br />RR"}}
