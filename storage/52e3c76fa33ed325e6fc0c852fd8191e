At any rate, with multiple shelves or long shelves, tubes will spread the light out better, thus giving more coverage.  I use 5 shelves in my mini-greenhouse, with a 48\" fixture hanging vertically in front of the unit, which holds four fluorescent tubes with a color temperature of 6,500K.  By hanging the light fixture vertically, the fixture lights the entire greenhouse between all shelves.  With only one bulb, you're limited in coverage.  They'd be great for tubs and the like, but there is no need for 250 watts.  It will burn five or more times the electricity your projects require.<br />RR"}}
