I've used them in pinches for years.  Wring them out of excess moisture, and make sure they're fluffed up in the terrarium.  You can even paste them to the sides.  They won't contaminate for weeks, so if you change them for fresh every few days, you'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7992509</prev>\n<first>7992228</first>\n<last>7992533</last>\n<when>1202427056</when>\n<utime>02/08/08 01:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
