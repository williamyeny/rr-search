Gypsum provides a ten to twenty percent increase in yields, provided you've otherwise made an efficient substrate.  Furthermore, gypsum protects against pH swings as the mycelium colonizes the substrate.  Calcium and sulfur are both required for mushroom formation.  Many common substrate materials that growers use are deficient in these elements, thus the addition of gypsum.<br />I know of no commercial mushroom farms that don't use gypsum in substrates.<br />RR"}}
