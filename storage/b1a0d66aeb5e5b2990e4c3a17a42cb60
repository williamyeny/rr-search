I used to mist a ten percent bleach solution in the air, but got tired of burning my eyes everytime I had to do sterile work.  Now I spray the room with Oust until it's a fog.  Let the fog settle, then repeat.  After the second Oust treatment settles, turn on the laminar flow hood and allow it to run for an hour before beginning sterile work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also important to remember we humans are the number one vector of contamination during sterile work, not the air.  Wear gloves, mask, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5597109</next>\n<prev>5594227</prev>\n<first>5594227</first>\n<last>5611425</last>\n<when>1146881243</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 05:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
