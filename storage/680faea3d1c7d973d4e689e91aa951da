I'll very slowly start letting the pressure out over the next few days.  Those are 21 year old spores, and even with soaking in distilled water for 30 days, they hadn't expanded at all as measured under the microscope.  I'm hoping this will force some h2o into them.  If necessary, I'll pump it up a bit more.  I just didn't want to make a glass grenade, seeing as how I had to pump it up in front of the flow hood to make sure I got clean air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4257466</next>\n<prev>4227433</prev>\n<first>4221218</first>\n<last>4257466</last>\n<when>1117238345</when>\n<utime>05/28/05 02:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
