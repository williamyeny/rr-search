Spent cakes are. . .spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of this thread and the first question don't match.  If the cakes haven't flushed yet and they're fresh, they can be spawned to coir.  Spent cakes can't.  Contamination will set in.  Spent cakes that have flushed numerous times are. . .spent.  In addition, they're covered with contaminants that would just love to have a fresh substrate to bloom in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6870680</next>\n<prev>6868711</prev>\n<first>6868697</first>\n<last>6871393</last>\n<when>1178255008</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 08:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
