So instead of chucking them can i possibly make mycelium syringes, or collect all the mycelium and make a mixed casing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uncolonized parts will soon contaminate, and it's awfully hard to remove it all.&amp;nbsp; When substrate doesn't colonize, there's always a reason.&amp;nbsp; If it's not due to lack of gas exchange, then either your substrate is contaminated with bacteria or the mycelium is too weak.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, it's the trash can tek and time to start over with fresh substrate and spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12685898</next>\n<prev>12685767</prev>\n<first>12685730</first>\n<last>12685898</last>\n<when>1275685910</when>\n<utime>06/05/10 12:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
