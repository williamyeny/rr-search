That is disinformation and it makes the hair on my neck stand on end when I see it constantly repeated.  They are unrelated.  In fact, the secretions from many fungi are used to make antibiotics.   Read up on the production of penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin  and other antibiotics that are made from the secretions of fungi. This has been known for a long time in professional circles.  For some reason, people around here keep repeating the same old 'mushroom piss' crap and others read it and repeat it ad nauseum.  The secretions, which contain acetone and other volatile compounds can actually be fermented and &lt;i&gt;distilled&lt;/i&gt; out of the liquid culture the fungi mycelium is being grown in.  In commercial penicillin production, large fermentation tanks of over 30,000 gallons are common.  It is not the penicillium mold itself that they make penicillin from, but its secretions.  Please stop using urine as an analogy for the antibiotic secretions of our precious fungi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5755229</next>\n<prev>5754538</prev>\n<first>5752511</first>\n<last>5774986</last>\n<when>1150422017</when>\n<utime>06/16/06 04:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
