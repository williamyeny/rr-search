If you let it rattle too much, your grains will be too dry at the end of the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As pressure is getting reached, you'll hear a slight hiss before the weight actually rattles.&amp;nbsp; At this point, reduce the stove to the minimum setting that will keep it slightly hissing without rattling.&amp;nbsp; It only rattles when the pressure is exceeding the set point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to leave the weight off for the first five to ten minutes after steam begins to escape. This purges the air out of the unit, ensuring there is only steam in the PC, not air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to use a small amount of Vaseline around the beveled edges of both the cooker and lid.&amp;nbsp; This not only makes it easy to get the lid off later, but prevents wear and helps stop leaks by lubing the interface, allowing it to squeeze tighter together.&amp;nbsp; Don't overtighten the wing nuts either.&amp;nbsp; They only need to be snug and then perhaps 1/8 turn after that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12288215</next>\n<prev>12287401</prev>\n<first>12287086</first>\n<last>12288867</last>\n<when>1269805931</when>\n<utime>03/28/10 10:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
