Therefore, you must mist to make up for that lost moisture on a daily basis.&amp;nbsp; The overspray from misting will get on the perlite, keeping it nice and damp as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the 'cake' didn't absorb anything.&amp;nbsp; The individual cells of mycelium must absorb the water by osmosis, which requires a higher pressure outside the cell than inside.&amp;nbsp; If the cake is 'floating', it helps to put something on top to weight it down a bit to increase water pressure on the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9890396</next>\n<prev>9889533</prev>\n<first>9885828</first>\n<last>9934541</last>\n<when>1235933448</when>\n<utime>03/01/09 08:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
