{"key":"post-6629464","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6629464</id>\n<content>I wouldn't patch this late into the game, especially with coir.  Just let it fruit.  At this point, you're probably very close to hyphal knots forming and putting another layer of coir on top will set you back.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of you, please keep things on topic.
