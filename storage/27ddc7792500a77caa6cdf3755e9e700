{"key":"post-6872709","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6872709</id>\n<content>Never use a heating pad at any time under any substrate.  Also, study up on nomenclature.  When you refer to 'your casing' you're only referring to the top layer.  The substrate and its moisture content is far more important. 'Mycobag' doesn't tell anything except that &lt;i&gt;whatever your substrate is&lt;/i&gt;, was apparently colonized in a mycological bag, which I assume is a filter patch poly bag. In addition, casing layers go on top.  A verm layer on the bottom does no good, but can do great harm, especially if it draws moisture out of the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's very common for all the pins for first and second flush to be set at the time of first flush.  The second flush pins become dormant until first flush is picked off, and then they begin to grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6873010</next>\n<prev>6872532</prev>\n<first>6872414</first>\n<last>6873043</last>\n<when>1178315535</when>\n<utime>05/05/07 12:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
