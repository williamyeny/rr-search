{"key":"post-6407603","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6407603</id>\n<content>Never heat a fruiting chamber, nor have standing water in the perlite.  Damp but not wet perlite will provide 99% humidity.  Standing water will LOWER the humidity.  Forget the air pump and stones, as they're not required or even helpful.  Just drill a few holes in the sides of your tubs and that will give air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're getting ahead of yourself though and have lots of time to read about fruiting chambers.  Start by reading up on sterile work and inoculation procedures.  You're going to need to start your cultures and let them grow out before you need a terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6407683</next>\n<prev>6407337</prev>\n<first>6403843</first>\n<last>6409619</last>\n<when>1167412552</when>\n<utime>12/29/06 07:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
