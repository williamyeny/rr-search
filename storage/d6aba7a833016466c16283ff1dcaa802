Not only that, they then tell others that Lysol and Oust cause mutants, and the myth spreads.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fog my room with oust to the point it's hard to see through.&amp;nbsp; I hold a can in each hand and spray for over a minute, completely fogging the room up.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't cause mutants.&amp;nbsp; I buy Lysol and Oust by the case.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8568538</next>\n<prev>8568100</prev>\n<first>8133126</first>\n<last>8586191</last>\n<when>1214526474</when>\n<utime>06/27/08 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
