A few of them. But then it was brought to my attention that when you live in a climate that is this dry, a mere shotgun will not do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not true.&amp;nbsp; My climate is drier than yours.(as a mod, I see your IP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, in extremely dry climates, you should run a humidifier in your house.&amp;nbsp; I run one all winter up here, because it's less than ten percent humidity.&amp;nbsp; A humidifier makes you healthier, lowers your heating and cooling bills, and keeps your skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, cakes do poorly in mini-greenhouses.&amp;nbsp; They really need the fresh air exchange and 95% and greater humidity.&amp;nbsp; Save your mini-greenhouse for when you move up to bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you shouldn't pipe a humidifier in to a greenhouse.&amp;nbsp; I've posted for a decade that it will fry your humidifier in short order.&amp;nbsp; Most members here who have disregarded that advice have a pile of broken down humidifiers in their junk pile.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a mini-greenhouse, simply take a knife and cut a bunch of slits in it, and then set the cool mist humidifier on the floor so it can shoot straight up.&amp;nbsp; Set it &lt;i&gt;beside&lt;/i&gt; the shelves, not on a bottom shelf.&amp;nbsp; If it's on a bottom shelf, the mist will hit the shelf above and rain back down.&amp;nbsp; The mist needs to be able to shoot nearly to the top of the greenhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cakes, use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt; or two.&amp;nbsp; If your humidity indoors is less than 25%, simply run a humidifier in the room in which the terrarium is located.&amp;nbsp; It will make you feel better and also lower your utility bills, since humid air has more thermal mass and will hold heat and cool better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13080762</next>\n<prev>13080743</prev>\n<first>13080204</first>\n<last>13080882</last>\n<when>1282362830</when>\n<utime>08/21/10 06:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
