You don't need distilled water though, I always use tap water.  Gypsum at ten percent is fine, but that 5% might be a bit heavy on the lime, depending on the peat source.  I usually start out with a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  Your recipe above is showing about a teaspoon and a half.<br />RR"}}
