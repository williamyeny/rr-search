Thus, a 12K BTU burner produces approximately the equilavent of 3600 Watts.  The 75X has a 1650 watt element inside, therefore your stove produces twice the heat.  Bear in mind, not all of that heat goes into your product though.  Much is wasted with gas as you can tell by putting your hand above a pot on the stove.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An electric stove burner is probably better as it transfers nearly 100% of its heat to the product.  My stove has a 3200 watt electric burner and heats my 921 to full pressure in 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6424257</next>\n<prev>6424153</prev>\n<first>6424101</first>\n<last>6425310</last>\n<when>1167933471</when>\n<utime>01/04/07 07:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
