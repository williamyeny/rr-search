Do you mind explaining how I'm wrong? Why the fuck would anyone use peat as a casing if its more nutritive than coir?&amp;nbsp; And why do two others agree with me and not you? Please help me to understand why you think coir is a better casing when even you said in some of your videos and posts that peat is better. Coir shouldn't even be used as a casing. Its a substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't say coir was a better casing.&amp;nbsp; You made the incorrect statement that coir is too nutritive and will get contamination easier, which is what I said was incorrect.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peat/verm is a better suited casing material, but it must be limed to prevent contamination.&amp;nbsp; I believe coir is better suited as a bulk substrate ingredient, but many other experienced growers use it as a casing layer.&amp;nbsp; There's more than one way to skin a cat in this hobby.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16963804</next>\n<prev>16961844</prev>\n<first>16948231</first>\n<last>16967542</last>\n<when>1349324031</when>\n<utime>10/04/12 07:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
