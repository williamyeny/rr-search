You want a fully colonized jar of grains to start with.  Add sterilized distilled water to nearly fill up the jar, then shake well, and draw the now myceliated water back out.  This is far faster and more dependable than making LC from spores because you can smell the rye jar before using to make sure it isn't contaminated.  In addition, a jar of rye colonizes in two weeks, and will make at least 30 syringes.  You won't get that performance from karo water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree g2g is a better way to go if you're using grains to inoculate bulk.  This tek is for those who still want to use pf tek, as a way to get LC quickly and more safely than with sugar water.  The only time I use it is when running experiments on pf cakes, such as the beautiful flush of shiitake I have fruiting now from pf cakes.  I've used this tek on cubes and 5 edible species so far, with 100% success.  In fact, Roadkill used one of these syringes last November to inoculate some pf cakes as part of my DVD, and those oyster cakes are STILL flushing outdoors.  They've produced at least nine or ten flushes so far.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6741774</next>\n<prev>6741130</prev>\n<first>6741048</first>\n<last>6754506</last>\n<when>1175615618</when>\n<utime>04/03/07 06:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
