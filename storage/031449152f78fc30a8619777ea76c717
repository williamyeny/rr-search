You should then flame sterilize between each jar to prevent cross-contamination between jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note here too: 70% alcohol will do a better job of killing off contaminants than 90% or 99% alcohol.  The reason is that the cell wall is tricked by the water in the alcohol into admitting it into the interior of the cell, where the cell is then destroyed as the alcohol evaporates back out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7178413</next>\n<prev>7178265</prev>\n<first>7177320</first>\n<last>7179938</last>\n<when>1184508343</when>\n<utime>07/15/07 05:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
