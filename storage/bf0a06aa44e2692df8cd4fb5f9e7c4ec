Filter disks are forty cents each and last a lifetime.  Personally, my time is more valuable than to spend it cutting even ONE tyvek square for forty cents.  I'm sitting here looking at four cartons of tyvek coveralls on my shelf, but I won't use a single one for jar filters.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6558017</next>\n<prev>6557377</prev>\n<first>6557199</first>\n<last>6561711</last>\n<when>1171293982</when>\n<utime>02/12/07 05:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
