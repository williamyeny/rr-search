I've had a coir doormat outside my house for years, and it stays damp for months every spring and fall without a single spot of trich forming. Your LC is contaminated.&nbsp; It's very common for molds to be fully colonized into grains and not sporulate until spawned to a bulk substrate material.&nbsp; Always sniff each and every jar of spawn before using.&nbsp; You can detect most molds by scent, since they smell a lot like dirt.<br />I'd suggest moving on from LC.&nbsp; It's a very lame procedure that takes much longer than expanding mycelium on grains.&nbsp; In addition, LC favors molds over mushroom mycelium, and you never know if it's contaminated until you use it, wasting months of time.&nbsp; It's the exact reason there's no LC tek on my DVD.<br />RR"}}
