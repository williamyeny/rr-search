{"key":"post-6009954","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6009954</id>\n<content>I'd put two coolmists on timers or a humidistat inside the greenhouse for humidity, then simply cut about ten to twenty holes big enough to stick your arm through at various points in the sides.  Put half the holes you cut high, and the other half of the holes down low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is just about the size of my greenhouse, and the above is what I use.  I have no problem getting 95% humidity.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can at least double up on the number of shelves in that greenhouse, and put another shelf in the back.  There's a lot of wasted walking space in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need even more humidity until you get it filled up, you can put trays of damp perlite everywhere you don't have a project sitting.  It can sometimes be hard to keep enough humidity in an empty greenhouse.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6010034</next>\n<prev>6009917</prev>\n<first>6009443</first>\n<last>6010724</last>\n<when>1156907445</when>\n<utime>08/30/06 06:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
