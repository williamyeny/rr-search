Chop your straw and place it in a pot of water to soak for twelve hours or so.&amp;nbsp; Then, heat the water to between 140F and 160F and hold it there for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're growing cubensis, you can mix that compost into a bright, but shady spot outdoors.&amp;nbsp; Inoculate with grains or brf cakes.&amp;nbsp; It's not the best to use since cubensis is a primary decomposer, but it will work better than just the cakes by themselves.&amp;nbsp; The best use for that composted manure is to put around your flower beds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12570335</next>\n<prev>12570132</prev>\n<first>12569189</first>\n<last>12570335</last>\n<when>1273985620</when>\n<utime>05/16/10 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
