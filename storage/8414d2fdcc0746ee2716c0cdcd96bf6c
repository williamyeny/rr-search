They need a loose, wet, organic area such as the soil in houseplants to breed.  They just munch the mycelium, then go away unless there are large uncolonized areas of substrate in the FC, in which case it's the growers fault.  There also shouldn't be enough uncolonized casing material to support the larvae.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5800488</next>\n<prev>5800366</prev>\n<first>5797297</first>\n<last>10692730</last>\n<when>1151543934</when>\n<utime>06/29/06 04:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
