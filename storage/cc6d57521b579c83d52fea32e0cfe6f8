A dust mask will do absolutely NOTHING to stop contaminants from entering your work area, and the fan will pump them in under pressure.  Glove boxes work on the principle of still air, not moving air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do is cut holes large enough for your arms to fit through with a semi-snug fit.  Just wear latex gloves and wipe them down with alcohol before beginning work.  It's not necessary to find expensive long gloves for a tight seal.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, all you're trying to do is have a small area with no wind currents so you can do inoculations.  The glovebox doesn't have to be totally sealed up, and it need not be sterile.  Simply wash it out with soap and water and use.  Be sure to spray the air in the room outside the box with oust, and shut off any fans in the room before using the glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5630869</next>\n<prev>5630583</prev>\n<first>5630498</first>\n<last>8532663</last>\n<when>1147671559</when>\n<utime>05/15/06 08:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
