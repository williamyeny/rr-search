I colonize jars on an open shelf at room temperature and normal room lighting from the day of inoculation on.   Stamets started that &quot;incubate in total darkness&quot; stuff with the early editions of TMC.  He no longer believes or recommends that.  I concur.   Put them in darkness for two or three days before you birth, so the light can come back to them at the same time as full colonization and the massive reduction in CO2 levels that come with the introduction of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5834452</next>\n<prev>5834218</prev>\n<first>5834134</first>\n<last>5834491</last>\n<when>1152357780</when>\n<utime>07/08/06 02:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
