And wouldn't a better method be to grow out a multispore flush, select some of the best fruits, and take a tissue culture from that, for agar transfer, and therefore an instant isolate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong on both counts.&amp;nbsp; It takes a few transfers, not generations to isolate strains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloning is never better than isolation due to the increased number of cell divisions which have already occurred.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19018166</next>\n<prev>19017487</prev>\n<first>19016329</first>\n<last>19018896</last>\n<when>1382532427</when>\n<utime>10/23/13 03:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
