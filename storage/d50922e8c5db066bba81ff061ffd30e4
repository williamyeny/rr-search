Paper isn't a good medium to print on due to the acids and caustic materials used in paper making.&amp;nbsp; I've had VERY poor results with more than 2 year old prints on paper.&amp;nbsp; Prints over 5 years old are nearly impossible to use, if made on paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to use the prints within a year, paper is fine, but don't count on it for long term storage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10700024</next>\n<prev>10699973</prev>\n<first>10699227</first>\n<last>10700089</last>\n<when>1247952856</when>\n<utime>07/19/09 12:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
