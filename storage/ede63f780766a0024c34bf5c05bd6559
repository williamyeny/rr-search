{"key":"post-7662966","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7662966</id>\n<content>Lots of people have started with kits, and they're a great way to learn the ropes.  I'd suggest looking at our vendor page before ordering, and see what they have to offer.   While you're growing the kit, you'll have plenty of time to study the boards here and learn what you need to know.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7663043</next>\n<prev>7662962</prev>\n<first>7662651</first>\n<last>24868741</last>\n<when>1195675861</when>\n<utime>11/21/07 10:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
