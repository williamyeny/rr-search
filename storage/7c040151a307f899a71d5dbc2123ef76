However, part of experimenting is reporting the results accurately, even if they don't match what we 'thought' would happen.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to all, and never be afraid to try something just because it's weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, people are so resistant to change, perhaps if you have a 'weird' idea, just go ahead and try it rather than posting first.&amp;nbsp; If it works, post the pics.&amp;nbsp; That way, nobody can call you an idiot. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7490886</next>\n<prev>7490647</prev>\n<first>7488926</first>\n<last>7490896</last>\n<when>1191683626</when>\n<utime>10/06/07 06:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
