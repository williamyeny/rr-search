If you'll just let your bags or jars colonize on a shelf in a room of your house, they'll be exposed to normal room light.  This will help to initiate pinning as soon as the substrate is ready to support fruitbodies.  Colonizing your jars in the dark only delays pinning, and delay is not good in this hobby."}}
