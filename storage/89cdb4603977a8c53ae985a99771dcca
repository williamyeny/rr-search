Beginning growers are always trying to save a contaminated jar, and sometimes they succeed.  Then they find they can't get a crop again because the spore load in their house is simply too high.  Toss out moldy jars without opening, or PC first, then open.  Definitely, contaminants build up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the growing chamber, it really doesn't matter how many contaminants there are as long as you have good air circulation and fresh air supply.  Cobweb and trich/penicillium won't grow in cool, disturbed, fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6090009</next>\n<prev>6087611</prev>\n<first>6087436</first>\n<last>6090660</last>\n<when>1158884382</when>\n<utime>09/22/06 03:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
