PRO U KNOW IT ALL SO TELL US AT LEAST THAT.&amp;nbsp; You're so pro and scientific.&amp;nbsp; Do you even have or use a ph meter or do you just follow recipies?&amp;nbsp; LMFAO. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms are 100% composed of mycelium, and mushrooms are food for mammals, therefore mycelium is food for mammals. (If A=B, and B=C, than A=C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly where are pictures of all the mushrooms you've grown on spent cakes?&amp;nbsp; Before you call anyone a dumbass, the rule around here is you have something besides an 'idea' to back up your claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cubensis is a primary, not secondary decomposer.&amp;nbsp; Oyster mushrooms for example can be both.&amp;nbsp; You can grow Shiitake on sawdust blocks, and then re-sterilize the blocks and inoculate with oyster mycelium for a second round.&amp;nbsp; You can't however use them to grow Shiitake again, nor could you grow Shiitake on spent oyster mushroom blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is don't argue that which you know nothing about, and don't call people dumbass for not supporting your theory, which is not sound to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment, and then post the results.&amp;nbsp; That's how it works.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9523539</next>\n<prev>9523470</prev>\n<first>9521927</first>\n<last>9524114</last>\n<when>1230751862</when>\n<utime>12/31/08 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
