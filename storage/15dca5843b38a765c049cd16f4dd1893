They used to use 1 gallon, but they were incubated at a 45 degree angle to allow for gas exchange. 1/2 gallon jars bite in my opinion.  The failure ratio I experienced was completely unacceptable due to anerobic conditions in the center of the jars.  You'll run into the same problem with 1 gallon unless you build angled shelves.  Personally, for home growers, 1 quart or 1 liter jars work best.<br />RR"}}
