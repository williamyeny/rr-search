I've experiment with 1.2kg, 2.5kg, 4kg, and 7kg bags full of substrate. And the highest yield goes to the 1.2kg bags(the smallest bags).<br />Any of you guys know what are the reasons?<br />You can share your own experience in this thread if you like, it would be very appreciated.</blockquote><br />The bags are plastic and nothing grows on plastic.&nbsp; It does no good to say 'bags' if you don't say what is IN them.&nbsp; <br />As we've known for decades, smaller substrates are more efficient by far than larger substrates.&nbsp; That's why brf cakes are the most efficient substrate of all from a biological efficiency standpoint.<br />For preparing grain spawn, larger containers get more sterilized thus are more efficient as long as one can work them properly and not get contaminated, which results in a greater loss the larger the bag size.<br />RR"}}
