By using this much, you can drill several holes 1/2&quot; / 1 cm in diameter in the sides of the container, just below the top of the perlite.  Drill another series of holes near the top of the container.  The circulation between all the holes will give your air exchange and the excess perlite will still maintain humidity for you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6261910</next>\n<prev>6261801</prev>\n<first>6261801</first>\n<last>6261910</last>\n<when>1163019063</when>\n<utime>11/08/06 10:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
