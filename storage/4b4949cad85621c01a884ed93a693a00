Bear in mind, spraying primordia with a mister is a major cause of aborts.  The edges are protected from the mister so they pin there.  As said above, drying out will also result in pins only on the edges, as will improper casing layer PH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a microclimate boost by laying a sheet of wax paper over the top of the tray.  Leave it loose so air can circulate under it.  This will raise the humidity right at the surface of the casing layer.  Be sure to change it out for a fresh sheet of wax paper every second day.  Dunk the entire tray between flushes by letting it fill up in the sink and let the water overflow gently and go down the drain for a few hours.  You can set a jar full of water on top to keep it submerged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5418354</next>\n<prev>5412494</prev>\n<first>5403419</first>\n<last>5418354</last>\n<when>1142634241</when>\n<utime>03/18/06 12:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
