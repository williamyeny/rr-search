{"key":"post-6776218","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6776218</id>\n<content>With all the recommendations to pasteurize substrate and casing material by the experienced growers, I fail to see why you'd want to PC them, but it's your choice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest spawning your mycelium into the coir.  You won't case it for ten days to two weeks after the coir substrate has had a chance to get fully colonized.  At that point, make your casing mix up and apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you can learn proper nomenclature, the 'casing' is only the non-nutritious top layer.  It is not a name for the project or a synonym for the tray that holds it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6776302</next>\n<prev>6776206</prev>\n<first>6776192</first>\n<last>6777071</last>\n<when>1176335378</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 02:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
