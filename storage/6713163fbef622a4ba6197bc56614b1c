A 'casing' is a non-nutritious layer placed over the top of the bulk substrate.<br />I would advise against the above procedure because you want your bulk substrate to colonize with mycelium as fast as possible.  Failure to mix the spawn into the bulk substrate will slow down colonization, which leaves your manure/compost/etc., open for contaminants.<br />RR"}}
