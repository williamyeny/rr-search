It's possible you're injecting a few trichoderma spores into the cakes along with your mushrooom spores and it just takes until after birthing to show up.  If not, it sounds like you're birthing too early.  They need to be 100% colonized for a few days before birthing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6069407</prev>\n<first>6065744</first>\n<last>6070233</last>\n<when>1158508836</when>\n<utime>09/17/06 07:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
