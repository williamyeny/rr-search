It isn't worth letting those green spores puke all over your grow area, ruining future crops just for a second flush.  You'll hate yourself later, unless this is your last grow.  Get rid of contaminated projects on first sight.  They'll often recover and flush again when placed into some manure outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6796206</next>\n<prev>6796151</prev>\n<first>6795940</first>\n<last>6796206</last>\n<when>1176770908</when>\n<utime>04/17/07 03:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
