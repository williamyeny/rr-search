My colonizing jars are ALWAYS exposed to normal room lighting from the day of inoculation.  Perhaps one jar out of a hundred will make an early pin or two, but I simply spawn those pins right into bulk substrate along with the grains with zero ill effects. (in other words, small pins don't contaminate when spawned to bulk along with the grains)<br />Twenty years ago, Stamets wrote in TMC to \"incubate in total darkness\" and people stick to that as if they were the words of god.  However, stamets no longer teaches incubation in darkness, and I agree.  If you visit fungi perfecti, you'll see 10,000 square feet of incubation area, with 8' fluorescent tubes lighting the entire area for ten to twelve hours per day.  <br />When you increase air exchange by removing from jars and placing into fruiting conditions, your substrate will begin the pinning process whether or not you have incubated in total darkness or not.<br />RR"}}
