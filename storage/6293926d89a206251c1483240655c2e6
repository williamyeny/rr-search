Don't put cotton in the middle of a tyvek sandwich or it will get damp and ruin your day.  Use kite tyvek or tyvek from a set of coveralls.  Don't use three layers unless you have a lot of holes in the lid.  You'll cut off the gas exchange.  I drill four 1/8&quot; holes, and use two layers of tyvek, both on the outside of the lid so they stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6886297</next>\n<prev>6886030</prev>\n<first>6885943</first>\n<last>6886883</last>\n<when>1178590381</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 05:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
