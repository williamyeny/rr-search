They were wrong to be rude, and you were also right about the light helping with fresh air exchange in a shotgun terrarium.<br />The light warms up the interior of the terrarium, and this lowers the pressure slightly due to the molecules of air being farther apart.&nbsp; This causes the air to exit the terrarium holes as the relatively cooler, more humid air in the perlite migrates upward.(remember, moist air is lighter than dry air so it rises)&nbsp; This helps greatly with air exchange during the daylight cycle.&nbsp; The same thing happens if you put the terrarium in a window with sunlight.<br />You don't need to cut a window in the lid.&nbsp; 80% of the light which enters comes in through the sides.&nbsp; Just place your CFL lamp slightly above and to one side of the terrarium.&nbsp; Keep it within 5 or 6 inches(10 cm) for best results.&nbsp; If the terrarium heats up too much, back the light away slightly.<br />RR"}}
