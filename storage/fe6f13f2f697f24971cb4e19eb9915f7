I prefer layering, but after each layer is applied, gently shake the tray back and forth a bit so the layers 'merge'.  This seems to provide a bit faster recovery over fully mixing.  A danger with mixing is that you can damage the kernels, thus exposing uncolonized grains to the pasteurized, therefore not sterile, substrate.  If you chose to mix, be gentle.<br />RR"}}
