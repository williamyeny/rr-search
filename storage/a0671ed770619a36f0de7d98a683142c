Pressure cookers are very uncommon here(hardly anyone has cooked with them for decades), and the ones you can get are small and expensive, not suitable for doing multiple or tall jars. I plan on trying a combination of tyndallisation/peroxide. Rather than simply letting all the spores germinate in between each boiling phase, I plan to add peroxide to kill spores before they can germinate. If there is excess peroxide it will be decomposed by the next boiling phase. The enzymes present in the substrate that would decompose the peroxide are destroyed at 60C.<br />I do have a proper autoclave, but it is not suitable either. The chamber is small and the shape of a can turned on its side. Perfect for instruments, not for jars.</blockquote><br />This will fail too.&nbsp; It's best to listen to those who have come before.&nbsp; Either pressure cook grains, or steam for 8 hours.&nbsp; Peroxide isn't going to cut it for grains.<br />For the record, any more talk of dealing in this thread is going to result in some ban points handed out. . .<br />RR"}}
