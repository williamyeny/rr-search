{"key":"post-6005689","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6005689</id>\n<content>It's common to get aerial mycelium like that.  I wonder why it doesn't like your casing layer on top.  What's it made of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry about temperature.  75F may be ideal, but for sure they'll pin and fruit much higher.  People in Florida and Cambodia regularly pick mushrooms when daytime temps are in the 90's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep humidity very high, as close to 100% as you can get, and keep air exchange up.  It should pin soon.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6006105</next>\n<prev>6004266</prev>\n<first>5998489</first>\n<last>6006105</last>\n<when>1156811762</when>\n<utime>08/29/06 03:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
