The mycelium will produce its own heat, and any internal temperature above 83f slows down growth dramatically.  There is ZERO increase in rate of growth from 75F to 81F, and above that, growth begins to fall off and molds and bacteria are encouraged over mushroom mycelium.  If you incubate above 81F ambient temperature, the temperature inside the bag will be several degrees warmer, and you'll have a greatly increased chance of contamination, which people who use 'incubators' see all the time and think it's caused by something else, when it's actually the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won't take forever to colonize at 68F.  It will perhaps take three or four days longer than it would at 75F to 80F, but the extra three days isn't worth the chance of ruining your grow with a silly heating pad.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6787223</next>\n<prev>6786369</prev>\n<first>6786159</first>\n<last>6788495</last>\n<when>1176569041</when>\n<utime>04/14/07 07:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
