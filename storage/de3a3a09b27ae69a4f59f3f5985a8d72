Why else would you want to have to seal the bag up after OPENING the top of your PC and exposing to unsterile air?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly.&amp;nbsp; I use the .2 micron filter bags, which are also thinner. I don't preseal, but use a tyvek wrist sleve in each bag.&amp;nbsp; I sterilize in a 55 gallon drum outdoors, and then open it and put the sterilized substrates in a wheel barrow and roll them across the lawn to the house.&amp;nbsp; When the bags cool, they pull a vacuum and the wrist sleeve prevents the entry of contaminants 100%.&amp;nbsp; When I pull the wrist sleeve out to inoculate in front of the flow hood, I can see the bag inflate as the vacuum is broken.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15109292</next>\n<prev>15108840</prev>\n<first>15103831</first>\n<last>15111794</last>\n<when>1316572241</when>\n<utime>09/21/11 05:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
