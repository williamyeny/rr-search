Be sure to never leave the lid off a petri dish for more than five seconds.  That's long enough to lift the lid, make the pour, then replace the lid.  Be sure to wipe down the gloves with alcohol before use.  You also need to wrap the dishes with parafilm as soon as they cool.  With that much bacteria in your dishes, I'd say your bottle of agar got contaminated prior to your pour.  I use a whiskey bottle for agar, with a synthetic filter disk cut to fit inside the lid of the bottle, and a 1/4&quot; hole drilled in the lid.  This prevents the agar from getting contaminated as it cools from the PC cycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5392131</next>\n<prev>5391807</prev>\n<first>5391807</first>\n<last>5402187</last>\n<when>1142196153</when>\n<utime>03/12/06 10:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
