My experience is a collective of my own experiments and those I've learned from others, so I really don't care to have something named after myself.  Call the six sided terrarium with holes whatever you wish, but I'd prefer it not be called RR if you don't mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My design is also more of a terrarium style chamber, because the holes in the bottom have a negative pressure on them, which forces air up through the perlite, creating humidity and air exchange at the same time.  As said above, it's not really suitable for substrate in the bottom of the tub.  Good luck to all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7134979</next>\n<prev>7128328</prev>\n<first>7093072</first>\n<last>7142659</last>\n<when>1183573416</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 09:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
