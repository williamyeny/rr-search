Never mention cultivation in a thread with a vendor.&amp;nbsp; Spores are sold for microscopy use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You didn't properly pasteurize your substrate and/or casing layer, and that's why you have so many species of competitor fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Never ask for prints in cultivation.&amp;nbsp; Read the sticky threads at the top of the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Never bump your own thread without waiting the mandatory 24 hours.&amp;nbsp; It's not fair to other patient posters to get their thread bumped down the list.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15501164</prev>\n<first>15493822</first>\n<last>15501277</last>\n<when>1323653126</when>\n<utime>12/12/11 03:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
