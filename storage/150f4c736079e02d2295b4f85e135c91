Calcium and sulfur are important minerals for healthy mycelium.&amp;nbsp; The stick-preventing qualities are a side-benefit, not the primary function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid coffee will not increase the risk of contamination with grains-failure to follow sterile technique will increase the risk of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding coffee grinds to grains is counterproductive, because they're a bulk substrate ingredient.&amp;nbsp; I'm aghast that 8 years after the coffee thread, these most basic questions are still not understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, if one is &lt;i&gt;sterilizing&lt;/i&gt; the bulk substrate, such as in sawdust preparation, a small amount of liquid coffee can be added.&amp;nbsp; I dump my leftover pot of coffee into the sawdust mixer every single day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14561599</next>\n<prev>14561451</prev>\n<first>14557846</first>\n<last>14610747</last>\n<when>1307236702</when>\n<utime>06/05/11 04:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
