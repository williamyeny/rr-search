If you look at the four inoculation points against the glass, the distance between them is greater than the distance from each to the center of the jar.  Thus, when the outside is colonized, the center is as well.  We recommend waiting one week after full colonization so the mycelium can consolidate its hold on the subsrate, not to colonize the middle.<br />RR"}}
