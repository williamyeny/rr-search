The shorter the soak time, the longer the boil(not simmer) needs to be.  If you only soak for an hour or two, you'll probably need to boil for nearly an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the boil heats up the grains so that when you pour them into your collander, what excess moisture doesn't drain off, can evaporate due to the heat. It helps to shake the grains around in the collander every few minutes until they drain/dry.  You want the grains to look and feel dry on the outside when you load your jars, while still having them double the original dry size.  This is correct moisture content for all grains from WBS to popcorn.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6077479</prev>\n<first>6077388</first>\n<last>6077508</last>\n<when>1158683310</when>\n<utime>09/19/06 07:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
