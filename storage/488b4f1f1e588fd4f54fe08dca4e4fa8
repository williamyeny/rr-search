I live in a 40 year old condo building in a rainy climate, near a huge rainforest that has trichoderma growing on downed trees everywhere, and have black mold on the walls, ceiling, in the bathroom  and around all the windows, yet have very close to 100% success with grains, agar and bulk substrates.  All the grows I've ever posted have been from this nasty condo, and I filmed my DVD set here, so you can get a first hand look at how to avoid contaminats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a still air glovebox or pony up $500 for a small laminar flow hood.  Don't cut corners on sterile techinique.   Read my posts on steriiity, and you'll see the procedures I use.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6909807</next>\n<prev>6909079</prev>\n<first>6909079</first>\n<last>6909807</last>\n<when>1179081572</when>\n<utime>05/13/07 09:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
