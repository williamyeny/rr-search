If you did that, the interior of the bag would never exceed 100F and no pasteurization would occur.<br />You want the center of the substrate to BE at 140 to 170 for one hour, but NO longer than two hours.  Any way you figure out to do that works fine, but you'll almost always have to add hot water during the process as your substrate absorbs heat from the pasteurization water.  You'll need a meat thermometer.<br />RR"}}
