Many cube growers give up on them, thinking something is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also prefer a thin substrate such as 1 1/2&quot; of horse manure.  Peat/verm makes a nice casing layer, but keep it to 1/4&quot; in thickness.  Wax paper makes a huge difference by helping to keep humidity high right at the surface where pins will form.  Be sure to lift it up every time you fan, and replace it with a clean sheet every two days.   They are also a warmth loving species, so try to keep your FC in an 80F room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're not hard or difficult in any way.  They just take their time about fruiting, so hang in there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6593725</prev>\n<first>6593359</first>\n<last>6593792</last>\n<when>1172089689</when>\n<utime>02/21/07 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
