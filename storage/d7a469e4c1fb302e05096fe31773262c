It sounds like you might have standing water in your perlite or else the humidity would have been 98% after sitting overnight.  Be sure to totally drain the perlite before you put it in the terrarium.  Any standing water at all will lower the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5405622</next>\n<prev>5404403</prev>\n<first>5403556</first>\n<last>5410117</last>\n<when>1142465843</when>\n<utime>03/16/06 01:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
