As SOON as pressure is reached, reduce heat to the minimum setting that will maintain your pressure.  If the pressure drops, increase heat, if the weight rattles or excess steam escapes, reduce heat.  1&quot; of water should easily last an hour.  I watch my PC closely, and can run two hours or more, on 1&quot; of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use foil on the lids.  A PC will drip water from the lid due to condensation, and your jars need to be protected from it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7054803</next>\n<prev>7054599</prev>\n<first>7054586</first>\n<last>7055497</last>\n<when>1182056544</when>\n<utime>06/17/07 08:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
