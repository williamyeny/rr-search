All you'll do is release millions of trichoderma spores into your growing area and all over your body, hair, carpet, walls, etc., ruining future grows.  Moldy projects should be gently misted to hold the spores in place, then carefully placed into plastic bags and disposed of.  Afterward, go on a cleaning spree like you were a surgeon about to do a heart transplant in your grow area.  Bleach bomb everything and scrub the walls, shampoo the rugs, blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6214096</next>\n<prev>6213928</prev>\n<first>6213106</first>\n<last>6296941</last>\n<when>1161886802</when>\n<utime>10/26/06 09:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
