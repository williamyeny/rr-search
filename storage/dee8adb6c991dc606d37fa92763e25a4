I know plenty of people with 5+ years experience that use there own Floured Grain ratio's in Cake and Spawn them. Just because you see a Mono does not mean its from Spawned Grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how much discouragement people give to others... its a little ridiculous. Everyone has there own methods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP Spawning Cakes to bulk is fine, check out my Signature for some Ratio's on Cakes to Coir/Verm Bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who discouraged him?&amp;nbsp; I only saw one person with manhood issues in his sig, but the rest of the people telling him it's fine, which it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully colonized cakes can be removed from the jars, rinsed off well, and then crumbled to bulk substrates.&amp;nbsp; This has been done for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grains are not over rated though.&amp;nbsp; For a given pressure cooker size, one can certainly prepare much more grains than cakes, and an equal amount of grains will colonize much faster than cakes.&amp;nbsp; However, for achieving maximum success with grains, a flow hood is recommended.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit to new growers of using cakes as spawn is they can be prepared without the use of a pressure cooker.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15354884</next>\n<prev>15354843</prev>\n<first>15353929</first>\n<last>15361091</last>\n<when>1321031307</when>\n<utime>11/11/11 07:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
