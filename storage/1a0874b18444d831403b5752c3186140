{"key":"post-7092636","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7092636</id>\n<content>I also sell tyvek coveralls on my site.  They're XXX Large and will make LOTS of filters.  It's a much higher grade and thickness than post office tyvek.  They're also machine washable for reuse.  I wouldn't trust vacume cleaner bags.  Most hepa vacs have a filter on the exhaust after the air passes through the bag.  That's where the true filtering takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coffee filter/barbed wire fence comment was from yours truly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7092686</next>\n<prev>7092485</prev>\n<first>7092307</first>\n<last>7148109</last>\n<when>1182830174</when>\n<utime>06/26/07 06:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
