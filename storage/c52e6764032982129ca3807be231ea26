The rocks are dense and heavy. 20 to 30 grams of fresh sclerotia isn't that much.  It won't be more than half a golf ball in size, which is easy to eat.  They also have a taste and texture similar to almonds.<br />It really doesn't take four months either, although the stones will get a bit larger if you give them longer to grow.  A good strain will begin producing sclerotia at full colonization.  I've harvested them from quart jars after 8 weeks.<br />You really do just set them on a shelf and forget they're there.  Nothing could be easier.  I've found that using weak coffee to hydrate the grass seed or rye berries results in faster sclerotia production.<br />RR"}}
