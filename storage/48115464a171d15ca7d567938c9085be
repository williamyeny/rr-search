{"key":"post-9436239","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>9436239</id>\n<content>Contrary to popular belief, making LC from spores is a horrible idea.&amp;nbsp; You have to remember, people post their success pictures, and rarely admit or post failure pictures.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium in LC grows FAR slower than mycelium on grains or brf cakes, so use your spores to inject substrates until you learn agar work.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, I'll be glad when this whole LC from spores fad goes away. You can't usually see contaminants in LC, so you waste however much time you spend watching those tiny flecks grow, and then you don't know if they're any good or not until you inject them into cakes and wait to see what happens.&amp;nbsp; Thus, if they're good it's great.&amp;nbsp; But, if they're bad, you've just wasted 30 days or more of growing time all to make a silly $10 syringe go farther.&amp;nbsp; In my life and probably yours, 30 wasted days plus materials is worth far more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9436267</next>\n<prev>9436214</prev>\n<first>9435715</first>\n<last>12142630</last>\n<when>1229367040</when>\n<utime>12/15/08 08:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
