Then manually wring out your bulk until all the water drips out, and toss it into an oven safe cooking bag. Toss it in the oven at 180F for 30-45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 45 minutes in a 180 oven, the center of that bulk substrate is still going to be room temperature.&amp;nbsp; Even if you put it in a bag and dropped it into boiling water, it's going to take at least 30 minutes for the center of the substrate to reach minimum pasteurization temperature of 140F/60C, and it then needs to &lt;b&gt;remain&lt;/b&gt; at that temperature for a full hour after that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12434737</next>\n<prev>12433617</prev>\n<first>12432173</first>\n<last>12434737</last>\n<when>1271906992</when>\n<utime>04/22/10 06:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
