I would have expected the filter to remove those.   I shut down all the HEPA's in the house, and noticed a definite improvement in contamination rates in the fruiting chambers.---Bear in mind, I'm not talking about a laminar flow hood, which will clean the air in a room until there's practically no particles floating at all.  I'm only dissin' on the $100 units with paper filter elements they sell in department/hardware stores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6082011</next>\n<prev>6082001</prev>\n<first>6081031</first>\n<last>6082436</last>\n<when>1158773403</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 08:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
