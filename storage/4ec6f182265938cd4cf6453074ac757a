The surface of your substrate is going to steam somewhat and evaporate moisture, but if the center reaches that temperature, all your moisture by definition will be gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is physics, not opinion.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19211238</next>\n<prev>19211230</prev>\n<first>19210357</first>\n<last>19215956</last>\n<when>1385898736</when>\n<utime>12/01/13 01:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
