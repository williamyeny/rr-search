A few points need to be made though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grains can be soaked or not soaked.  I prefer to soak because it softens the kernels slowly, preventing them from bursting later.  Soaking also germinates bacterial endospores, but those are mainly a problem with popcorn, not rye or wbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's very beneficial to rinse the grains BEFORE the soak to remove dirt, dust and chaf.  Simply put them in a large pot and fill with water, then stir the grains around and drain the water out.  You'll see all the dirt and dust draining away from your grains.  Repeat until the water pours off clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak from 4 to 24 hours, then bring to a boil.  Grains can be simmered or boiled, but they should be boiled in the water they soaked in, or added to fresh cold water, then brought to a boil.  Do not add cold grains to hot water.  That bursts kernels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grains are ready to be sterilized when they're double the original size.  Obviously, if you soak 4 hours, you'll need a longer boil then if you soak for 24 hours.  Drain while hot because the steam that evaporates off the surface of the grains while they drain gets rid of excess moisture. Shake the grains in the collander so they roll around and lose more surface moisture to steam. You want the grains to look dry when you load the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer to not boil after the soak, you can simply dry the outside of the grains with a towel after a 24 hour soak, then load and PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should go without saying to rinse the grains, and start the soak with hot tap water.  This not only stimulates bacteria to germinate, but also hydrates the kernels much better than cold water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6306903</next>\n<prev>6306330</prev>\n<first>6305951</first>\n<last>6318467</last>\n<when>1164695784</when>\n<utime>11/28/06 08:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
