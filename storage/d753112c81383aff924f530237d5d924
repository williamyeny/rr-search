Not only will having the holes too large dry out your grains, but they also encourage invitro pinning due to the low CO2 levels.  You want the CO2 levels in your grain spawn to be quite high.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6732137</next>\n<prev>6732015</prev>\n<first>6729076</first>\n<last>6732531</last>\n<when>1175376284</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 12:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
