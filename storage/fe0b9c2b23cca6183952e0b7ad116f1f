I didnt do any of the procedures that are listed here. Just put the needle in, put some spores in, took it out and went to the next jar. Hell there was even pizza on my shirt. 9 out of 12 jars survived, but then one contaminated in the terrarium and that caused like all but 3 to go. I didnt realize I should of cleaned the terrarium after that... now I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cake contaminating doesn't cause other fully colonized cakes to get mold.&amp;nbsp; Your lack of sterility led to a horrible failure rate.&amp;nbsp; Don't brag about how dirty you are when you only succeeded in three out of twelve jars.&amp;nbsp; What if only three out of every twelve airplanes to take off were able to make it to their destination without crashing?&amp;nbsp; There's a reason we practice clean procedures, and you've just demonstrated to the rest of the new growers exactly why.&amp;nbsp; Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11974376</next>\n<prev>11968658</prev>\n<first>11923489</first>\n<last>11988991</last>\n<when>1265402479</when>\n<utime>02/05/10 10:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
