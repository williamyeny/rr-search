Badham (1979). His work reinforces the conclusions of other researchers working with the Basidiomycetes: more pinheads are initiated upon exposure to blue and and ultra-violet light with distinct peaks at 370, 440, and 460 nanometers. Badham showed that light stimulation at these wavelengths for as little as half a millisecond per day caused primordia to form. In contrast, red, infra-red, and green light having wavelengths greater than 510 nanometers were ineffective.&quot;(Mushroom Cultivator p.147).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a horribly flawed, non-peer-reviewed 'experiment' which should have never been published in the first place, and even worse should have never been repeated in TMC. Had the internet and forums like this one been around in those days, it would have never survived two weeks, let alone be repeated years and years later. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Those mushrooms were exposed to ambient room light during the whole experiment, which as we've known for decades is enough to trigger pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should never make the mistake that primordia formation is the only purpose of light.&amp;nbsp; Fungi uses light during the entire fruiting cycle, and this is the reason mushroom caps turn and orient themselves toward it during growth, which the author of that so-called 'study' was apparently unaware.&amp;nbsp; They are &lt;i&gt;deriving energy&lt;/i&gt; from the light and using it in their metabolism.&amp;nbsp; Too many people confuse plants with fungi, and that has just got to stop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been hundreds of threads just like this one where horrible disinformation from the past keeps getting repeated &lt;i&gt;ad nauseum&lt;/i&gt; as if it were etched in stone, totally disregarding contemporary research which has been duplicated and repeated thousands of times, not &lt;b&gt;one time&lt;/b&gt; and then published without one shred of backup evidence or further experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof is in current grows being posted right here, which amount to thousands of peer reviews.&amp;nbsp; Look at the amount of mushrooms grown even ten years ago in pf tek style aquariums with drip shields, no misting(causes aborts &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot; title=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot;/&gt; ) and no constant fresh air exchange, with grows today where we see solid canopies of mushrooms, or cakes so full you couldn't fit another mushroom on them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15392699</next>\n<prev>15392388</prev>\n<first>15385830</first>\n<last>15393125</last>\n<when>1321718611</when>\n<utime>11/19/11 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
