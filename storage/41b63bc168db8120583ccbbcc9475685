Green molds in spawn are caused by improper sterile technique, but in the fruiting chamber it's as said above, provided the cultures were clean when placed into fruiting conditions.  There is no need to filter air entering a fruiting area.  Good luck on finding the cause.  Look for areas the air is blocked and doesn't circulate.  A small oscillating fan might even be a good investment if your greenhouse is large.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6736647</prev>\n<first>6736647</first>\n<last>6736781</last>\n<when>1175493079</when>\n<utime>04/02/07 08:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
