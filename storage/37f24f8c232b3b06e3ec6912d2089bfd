CO2 levels need to be high during colonization, and the mycelium can't jump across the large gaps if you don't compress the straw.   When I used to use five gallon buckets, I put a ten pound weight on top of the straw after spawning to hold it compressed.  Straw logs kill both of those birds with one stone because you stuff the straw very tightly into the tubing, which also helps to hold CO2 levels high.<br />RR"}}
