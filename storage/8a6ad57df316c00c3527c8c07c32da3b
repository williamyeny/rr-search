It ain't gonna work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's plenty of information around here on mini-greenhouses and also detailed explanations of how to set them up and why you want to have them in a room the proper temperature, not a cold or hot garage.

If you're interested in how I do it, search my username and the word mini-greenhouse.  &lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7952030</next>\n<prev>7949297</prev>\n<first>7947370</first>\n<last>7952330</last>\n<when>1201624652</when>\n<utime>01/29/08 06:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
