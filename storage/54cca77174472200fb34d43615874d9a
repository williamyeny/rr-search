Enough gas exchange occurs around the edges, and you can also poke a couple of nail sized holes in the top.  It's a good idea to keep light off during bulk substrate colonization so that you can introduce light at the same time as the major pinning triggers such as full colonization and increase in air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7139254</prev>\n<first>7139076</first>\n<last>7139478</last>\n<when>1183780104</when>\n<utime>07/07/07 06:48 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
