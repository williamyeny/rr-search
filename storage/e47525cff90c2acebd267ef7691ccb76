If there's any advice you could give me or anyone else with the equipment I got right now and no more funds left please help I'm freakin out here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Toss the digital hygrometer in the trash where it belongs.&amp;nbsp; I've posted for years they're crap.&amp;nbsp; The search engine will return hundreds of hits from people throwing their hard earned money down the drain on those made in china pieces of shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.
