I once left a substrate out in the snow in below freezing temperatures for over two weeks, and once it was brought back in and warmed up, it was fruiting again within a week.<br />In our shiitake farm, we set substrate blocks that are ready to fruit out in the snow for up to two months until we're ready for them, which frees up space in the colonizing room for new substrates.&nbsp; Shiitake, oyster and many other species can withstand months of far below freezing temperatures.<br />RR"}}
