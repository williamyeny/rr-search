{"key":"post-6529366","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6529366</id>\n<content>I think you're confusing casing layers and substrate, as well as the definition of 'bulk' substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pf jar for example is a &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt; when fruited directly from the cake.  However, a pf jar is &lt;i&gt;spawn&lt;/i&gt; when used to inoculate manure or straw, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye is a &lt;i&gt;spawn&lt;/i&gt; when used to inoculate manure or straw, etc., but is a &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt; when cased with peat-verm or verm-coir, although coir is better suited as a substrate than a casing material.  If you mix the rye in as an inoculant, it's &lt;i&gt;spawn&lt;/i&gt;, but if you lay it in a tray and apply a casing layer over the top of it, the rye becomes the &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;u&gt;bulk&lt;/u&gt; substrate is a large amount of material that supports mushroom growth that you spawn your mycelium into.  Bulk substrates can be manure, straw, coir, worm castings, coffee grinds, etc.  Grains can spawn to a bulk substrate, or serve &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the substrate, but are never considered a 'bulk' substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confused yet?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6530908</next>\n<prev>6529332</prev>\n<first>6529303</first>\n<last>6530908</last>\n<when>1170609216</when>\n<utime>02/04/07 07:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
