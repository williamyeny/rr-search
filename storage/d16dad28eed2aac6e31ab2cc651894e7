These spores often times cover the casing layer and can inhibit further pinhead development. . . For these reasons, one should pick the mushrooms at the stage when the veil begins to tear or soon thereafter.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be wise to check ones facts before calling bullshit on people who have been growing mushrooms longer than most members here have been alive. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/nono.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:nono:&quot; title=&quot;:nono:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16030007</next>\n<prev>16029532</prev>\n<first>15993294</first>\n<last>16048986</last>\n<when>1333313394</when>\n<utime>04/01/12 11:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
