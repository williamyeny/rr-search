I should also say I'm no fan of that design although a few growers have had good luck with it.  I don't like the downward flowing air because it seems that contaminants which get knocked off your hands/gloves will get blown into your open jar or petri dish.  I prefer the filter to be behind the work area so contaminants are blown back towards your body and not towards your sterile media.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5906353</next>\n<prev>5906093</prev>\n<first>5906093</first>\n<last>5906909</last>\n<when>1154043808</when>\n<utime>07/28/06 02:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
