Vacuum isn't nearly as strong as pressure, so doesn't pull the plug down as hard as pressure pushes it up. (The plug seals both ways on a sterilizer) Additionally, the toggle valve tends to get crud buildup on the seat over time and will also leak if you don't take it apart regularly to clean.&nbsp; <br />If you have a flow hood, simply allow the sterilizer or PC to cool in front of it so it doesn't matter if vacuum is lost.<br />For those without flow hoods, you can lay a freshly laundered towel over the lid of the sterilizer or PC as it cools.&nbsp; This will help to trap contaminant spores in the towel so they're not drawn in as easily.<br />When sterilizing agar, you don't want a vacuum since it will cause the still-hot agar to boil over.&nbsp; With agar, lift the toggle as soon as zero pressure is reached.&nbsp; You should have filtering on your agar bottle anyway.<br />RR"}}
