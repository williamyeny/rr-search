It will cause the filters to become damp and then contaminants can colonize right through them.&amp;nbsp; Colonize jars and spawn bags on an open shelf with adequate air circulation to prevent heat buildup.&amp;nbsp; I don't even allow my 5 pound substrate bags to touch each other.&amp;nbsp; If they do, a hot spot is created that kills the mycelium in that area in each bag.&amp;nbsp; When the bags are opened up, it leaves an uncolonized area that is susceptible to molds.&amp;nbsp; Remember, it's up to 5 degrees hotter in a 1/2 pint jar than outside, even hotter in a quart jar, and up to 20 degrees hotter in a large filter patch bag due to thermogenesis by the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12929018</prev>\n<first>12928620</first>\n<last>12929086</last>\n<when>1279725909</when>\n<utime>07/21/10 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
