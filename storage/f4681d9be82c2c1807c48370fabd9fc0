Condensation on the sides is an indication that it is warmer inside the box than outside the box.  Condensation is not related to humidity.  This is a common misunderstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For maximum humidity, rinse the perlite in a strainer under the faucet, then when it has drained well, dump it into your terrarium.   A 2&quot; layer of damp, but not wet perlite will give you 99% humidity for at least three weeks, which is the average duration of a flush anyway.  Rinse and reload the perlite when you dunk the cakes between flushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said above, pinning can take up to a couple of weeks.  Give them fluorescent lights on a 12/12 schedule and you'll see pins soon.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5989614</next>\n<prev>5983436</prev>\n<first>5978592</first>\n<last>17350439</last>\n<when>1156186454</when>\n<utime>08/21/06 09:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
