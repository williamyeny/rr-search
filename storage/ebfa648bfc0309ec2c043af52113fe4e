As much as I hate wal mart, I would never steal from them, nor condone anyone who does.  Don't steal, because there's no worse life form on the planet than a fucking theif.  I've known a lot of theives in my life and if they'll steal from a store, they'll steal from their best friend.  Everyone I've ever known who bragged of stealing, ended up stealing from me when my back was turned, so fuck off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6823750</prev>\n<first>6816792</first>\n<last>6823875</last>\n<when>1177366493</when>\n<utime>04/24/07 01:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
