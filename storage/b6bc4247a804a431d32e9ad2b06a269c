I do this by adding the dry hydrated lime to the dry peat.  Gypsum is added at the same time and mixed in well.  I use a full teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat, and gypsum is added at the rate of 5% to 10% of the total peat.  After bringing to the correct moisture level, moistened verm is then mixed in.  When allowed to sit like this for an hour, the ph is 7.3 to 8.0 every time, which is perfect for a casing layer. (be sure to test each recipie with the brand of peat you use)<br />Now, that being said, pinset quality is as much a product of the genetics of the particular substrain as it is the skill of the grower, or the type of materials he uses.  There's a lot we can do to screw up a good pinset, but if the strain is poor, there's not much that even the most skilled grower can do to get a decent flush.<br />RR"}}
