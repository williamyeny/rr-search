The air will disturb the surface and blow the contaminants everywhere.&nbsp;  Use a still air box to make transfers.<br />An alternative method I do is sometimes at the end of sterile work I'll shut off the flowhood and immediately make the transfers I need to make, and then turn the flowhood back on to clean up any mess which got into the air.<br />RR"}}
