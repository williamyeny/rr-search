We used an LC to inoculate one master jar about 2 weeks ago and now have a full jar to do 10 g2g's.&nbsp; I had read at one point that you never know if your lc is good or not until it fruits/doesn't fruit? True? Because the master jar looked perfect...</blockquote><br />This is exactly the reason I never have, and never will post an LC tek.&nbsp; Lots of molds are snow-white and never sporulate until exposed to air in a bulk grow.&nbsp; You might or might not be growing 40 jars of mold.&nbsp; The smell test will let you know if the 'majority' of what you're growing is mushroom mycelium, but even that's no guarantee when you use LC.&nbsp; Personally, I wouldn't waste time with it.&nbsp; LC is like playing Russian roulette with two bullets in the cylinder.<br />Agar to grain to G2G is much faster with guaranteed results, provided you verify your agar culture under the microscope before expanding into grains.&nbsp; Generally, you can see the contaminants on a petri dish because the air exchange stimulates molds to sporulate, but the microscope check is the icing on the cake.<br />RR"}}
