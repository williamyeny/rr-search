Dunking won't hurt small pins, so don't pick them off if they're there.  I make cakes on the dry side so they'll colonize faster, and then dunk and roll before first flush, and again between flushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also a good idea after harvesting a flush, to let the cake sit for a few days prior to the dunk for a resting period.  This tends to make the next flush more prolific than if you dunk right after picking.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6953140</next>\n<prev>6951019</prev>\n<first>6950937</first>\n<last>6953140</last>\n<when>1179846668</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 06:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
