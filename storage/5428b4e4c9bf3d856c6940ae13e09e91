There's too much movement in your arms, and having both arms moving really blurs the picture. Put the jar down and rest the camera on a book or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no way to tell from a blurry picture if it's mold or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8822191</next>\n<prev>8819210</prev>\n<first>8797647</first>\n<last>8843609</last>\n<when>1219588188</when>\n<utime>08/24/08 05:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
