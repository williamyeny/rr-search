I incubate jars on an open shelf at normal indoor room temperature while making absolutely no attempt to shield the jars from ambient room light.  Quart/liter jars of properly prepared and moistened rye berries colonize fully in ten to fourteen days.  I feel it's hardly worth the risk of overheating which stimulates thermotolerant bacteria, to subject jars to a higher temperature than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the room you colonize the jars in is very cold, simply put a space heater in there and heat the whole area.  This prevents your colonizing jars from sitting in a box of stagnant air, which is one of the biggest causes of wetspot bacteria next to overtemperature and improper moisture content.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5983585</next>\n<prev>5982965</prev>\n<first>5982452</first>\n<last>5983925</last>\n<when>1156167267</when>\n<utime>08/21/06 04:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
