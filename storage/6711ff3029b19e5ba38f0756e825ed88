Mix it into some horse or cow manure outside and it will probably recover and fruit if temps are above freezing in your area.  Get it outside now though.  If that is first flush, the mold came from within.  It's probably from too high an incubation temperature which slows down mushroom mycelium and speeds up molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6731224</next>\n<prev>6729217</prev>\n<first>6727700</first>\n<last>6731224</last>\n<when>1175303194</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 04:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
