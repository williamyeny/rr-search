The wood chips should be soaked for three days.  This isn't to germinate endospores, but rather to hydrate the wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it's best to supplement the sawdust/wood chips with up to 20% rice or wheat bran for nutrients.  This is the reason that substrate for woodlovers should be sterilized, rather than pasteurized.  If you skip the wheat or rice bran, a simple pasteurization will suffice, but performance will not be nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5939322</next>\n<prev>5938168</prev>\n<first>5938168</first>\n<last>5939322</last>\n<when>1154929646</when>\n<utime>08/07/06 08:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
