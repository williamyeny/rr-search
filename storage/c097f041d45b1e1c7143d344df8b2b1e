I've seen some teks on here for home made stirrers built the opposite way where they spin a magnet and use a coated nail or some such as a stir bar.<br />My stirrer has no magnet in the base, the only magnet is the stirbar.  I'm not sure that's a critical distinction, but it seems as though it would be.  Two magnets might cause too much friction and motor loads.  Something to look into anyway.<br />RR"}}
