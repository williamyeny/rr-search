The moisture that drains down into the substrate will help to hydrate it, similar to a dunk.  It will dry out on its own.  If you're worried, just leave the lid off for a few hours and some of it will evaporate.  Otherwise, just let it go.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6581468</next>\n<prev>6580902</prev>\n<first>6580387</first>\n<last>6581468</last>\n<when>1171818024</when>\n<utime>02/18/07 07:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
