It's a straw block.  I'd let it go another couple of days to see if that is trichoderma on top.  It sort of has that look, but looks can be deceiving when you've just unwrapped the bag. Aroma is a better indicator.  Does it smell like fresh mushrooms?  If so, it's probably ok. Ten to fourteen days is about average with straw for full colonization.   I would advise against casing it and just unwrap the block and let it fruit directly from the straw.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5986444</next>\n<prev>5986292</prev>\n<first>5986292</first>\n<last>5986444</last>\n<when>1156267066</when>\n<utime>08/22/06 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
