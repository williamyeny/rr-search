Until a few years ago, people thought if you had green mold on a cake, the mushrooms would kill you, or at least make you very sick. Bottom line is if you see molds, don't get down and snort the spores, but even if you did, very few are dangerous unless you have AIDS or some other immune disorder.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9519299</next>\n<prev>9514846</prev>\n<first>9513819</first>\n<last>9524923</last>\n<when>1230620014</when>\n<utime>12/30/08 08:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
