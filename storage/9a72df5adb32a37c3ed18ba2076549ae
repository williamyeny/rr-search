I'd just suggest a few weeks of hard reading, then you'll know what you'll want to do.  The pf tek is the easiest and most foolproof method, and if you follow the instructions, you won't go wrong.  Other methods are just as easy, so read up on them all, but most important is to understand the mushroom lifecycle, and study all you can about sterile procedure and follow it to the letter.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6681147</next>\n<prev>6680759</prev>\n<first>6680704</first>\n<last>6681914</last>\n<when>1174170081</when>\n<utime>03/18/07 01:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
