You can get one brand new for under $200, which is only twice the price of the made in china models, and the AA will be something you'll pass down to your grandchildren some day.&amp;nbsp; I guarantee the made in china models will be recycled into beer cans within a few years if you get one of those.&amp;nbsp; That makes the AA the best bargain out there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10925346</next>\n<prev>10925219</prev>\n<first>10925182</first>\n<last>10934168</last>\n<when>1251127338</when>\n<utime>08/24/09 06:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
