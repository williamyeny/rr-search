Rate of growth of the fruiting bodies falls off when you go outside that range.  Your fruits will grow in the upper 60F range, although slower.  There is quite a bit of grower feedback that mushrooms grown in cooler weather are more potent, so they're worth the extra wait.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7227543</prev>\n<first>7223568</first>\n<last>7227759</last>\n<when>1185499218</when>\n<utime>07/27/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
