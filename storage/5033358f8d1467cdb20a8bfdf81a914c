Trichoderma mycelium is white and is growing into the interior of the tray.  It is only the spores that are green on the surface.  By removing the 'green' you only took away the spores, thus releasing them and spreading the problem.  Next time, provide more air exchange.  Trichoderma thrives in stale, still air.<br />RR"}}
