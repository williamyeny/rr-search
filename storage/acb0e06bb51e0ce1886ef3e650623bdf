Coir, horse manure, worm castings, coffee grinds, cow manure, chicken manure, compost, straw, etc., are all good, and mixed they're even better.  Don't go over 5% of the total as chicken manure though.  Use gypsum at ten percent.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6886946</next>\n<prev>6886879</prev>\n<first>6886879</first>\n<last>6887185</last>\n<when>1178598147</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 07:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
