I'd suggest upping your fresh air supply during fruiting.  In addition, make sure your grow area is not on the floor.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7404286</next>\n<prev>7403805</prev>\n<first>7403782</first>\n<last>7404357</last>\n<when>1189688435</when>\n<utime>09/13/07 04:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
