It's a normal difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. Many grow rooms experience a ten degree differential every day.  I know mine does. Cold shocking is not useful for warm weather tropicals such as cubensis.  They will fruit just fine in 90 degree weather, just as they do in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unkempt, I see your top layer is fully colonized.  That is not normal or desired.  What did you use for a casing layer?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5894087</next>\n<prev>5893960</prev>\n<first>5886937</first>\n<last>5911574</last>\n<when>1153761749</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 08:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
