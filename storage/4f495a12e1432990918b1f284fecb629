Since your jars contaminated without being  inoculated, your filter was bad.   Make sure you use plenty of dry vermiculite on top of the brf.  Remove foil after sterilization so the verm doesn't get damp from the moisture in the brf.  Another cause of the verm barrier getting wet is having the jars sitting in the water as you boil.  Get the jars up on a rack or a layer or two of unused jar lids.  The jars don't need to be touching the water at all.  Begin timing when steam starts escaping from the lid on your kettle, not just when the water begins to boil.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6475971</next>\n<prev>6475926</prev>\n<first>6475792</first>\n<last>6477022</last>\n<when>1169225924</when>\n<utime>01/19/07 06:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
