The only reason posts get pushed to the back here is the people who refuse to use the search function, thus start a thread for every question they have such as 'should I dunk?', which has been answered thousands of times.   <br />Another big no-no people seem to do a lot is bump their own posts, which unfairly pushes other peoples posts back.  In fact, I always start on page three or four with the oldest unread post, then work my way back answering questions to page one, so when they bump their own posts, they're actually pushing it to the back of my line.<br />Personally, I would disagree with another forum, except perhaps one that is exclusively for pf tek, which would cut down on a lot of the traffic here.<br />RR"}}
