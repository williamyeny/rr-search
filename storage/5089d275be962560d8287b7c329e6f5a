This way, you see the growth right away and know if you have the good stuff or mold.  In addition, there is usually more air along the edges than in the middle so the culture takes off faster.  Furthermore, shooting along the glass causes the liquid to run farther down into the jar or bag, inoculating more of the substrate or spawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake for the one and only time(except pf cakes) when it's 20% to 30% colonized. Of course, you'll shake a second time when you use it as spawn to break it up, but the one and only shake I refer to is during the colonization period.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6715954</next>\n<prev>6715777</prev>\n<first>6714272</first>\n<last>6715954</last>\n<when>1175005241</when>\n<utime>03/27/07 05:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
