{"key":"post-6680425","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6680425</id>\n<content>Interesting, but I'm curious about something.   Are you aware that a 1/4&quot; hole has 16 times the area of a 1/16&quot; hole?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invitro pinning is caused by two main things.  First is low CO2 levels.  Second is a substrate that is losing moisture.  When those two conditions have been met, exposure to light comes in a distant third, but cubes will pin even without light, or light at very low levels.  Good luck in your growing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6680025</prev>\n<first>6676627</first>\n<last>6680425</last>\n<when>1174163613</when>\n<utime>03/17/07 11:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
