Syringes should always be boiled before re-use.  This isn't a tek, it's simply stating what has been said over and over again for years.<br />There is also no need or reason to PC a syringe.  Plastic doesn't harbor bacterial endospores, so anything that might be on a syringe will be killed off by simply boiling.  You still need to flame the needle between jars.  As hyphae pointed out, you certainly don't need a separate syringe for each jar.<br />RR"}}
