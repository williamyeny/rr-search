Rust won't hurt a thing, but plastic lids suck.  They require the filter material to be inside the jar where it gets wet when you shake, leading to contaminants.  Another problem with plastic lids is they are prone to fly off when you shake the jars, spilling grains everywhere.  I ordered 100 plastic lids from fungi.com a few years ago, and have thrown every single one in the trash.<br />RR"}}
