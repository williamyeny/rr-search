Soak it then PC, or what? This doesn't seem like a bad idea if you're having trouble maintaining a decent RH. Do you bury it under the perlite or just leave it on the surface?</blockquote><br />Please.&nbsp; The long standing rule around here is you don't bump your own thread for at least 24 hours.&nbsp; Sometimes we turn a blind eye when it's close, but three bumps in 18 minutes will get a lock every time.&nbsp; It's not fair to have everyone else get their thread knocked down the list to keep putting yours on top.<br />You also mentioned spores coming and growing.&nbsp; That's the kind of stuff that attracts attention, thus is also against the rules.&nbsp; You might want to read the forum guidelines at the top of the page.<br />RR"}}
