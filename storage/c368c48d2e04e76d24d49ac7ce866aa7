That's why it's so prone to cobweb mold when used as a casing layer. In addition, vermiculite acts like a sponge, absorbing water and holding it for the mycelium to use as needed.&amp;nbsp; Perlite is not capable of absorbing water because it's crystalline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threads like this&amp;nbsp; get started several times a year.&amp;nbsp; That's why I posted &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6610766#Post6610766&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; last year, so people wouldn't repeat the same mistakes that have been made many times before, by trying to substitute one for the other.&amp;nbsp; They're not compatable, and perlite isn't compatible with cakes, either as a contaminant barrier or moisture reservior.&amp;nbsp; If you followed pf tek, but with perlite, I'm sure you noticed your substrate was way too wet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8615012</next>\n<prev>8614947</prev>\n<first>8614563</first>\n<last>8619696</last>\n<when>1215659751</when>\n<utime>07/10/08 06:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
