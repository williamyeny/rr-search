Shake well again, and then draw the myceliated water back out into syringes.  As an alternative, you can pour the quart of myceliated water into a sterile gallon of water to dilute the solution.  You'll then have enough liquid culture to fill a few hundred syringes, and it only takes two to three weeks to get to this point from spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, after harvesting the mycelium from the surface of the grains as described above, you can then still use the left over grains to inoculate ten to twenty additional jars of grains via grain to grain transfer in the traditional method.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7724900</next>\n<prev>7724775</prev>\n<first>7721557</first>\n<last>7729579</last>\n<when>1196978304</when>\n<utime>12/06/07 11:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
