While you study up on casing teks, I'd suggest simply fruiting this one uncased.  You'll still end up with a good harvest.   Allow it to get fully colonized, then after a few days, expose to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6108916</prev>\n<first>6108908</first>\n<last>6108944</last>\n<when>1159409900</when>\n<utime>09/28/06 05:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
