Only a DC motor has speed controlled by current. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People burn down their houses every year doing just that, and just this year in my area, a baby was killed in a house fire because the dad tried to control a ceiling fan with a lighting dimmer, which is also wrong.&amp;nbsp; The electrical code was written for a reason, and it's also the reason electricians must be licensed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8947432</next>\n<prev>8946901</prev>\n<first>8933112</first>\n<last>8956183</last>\n<when>1221717766</when>\n<utime>09/18/08 09:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
