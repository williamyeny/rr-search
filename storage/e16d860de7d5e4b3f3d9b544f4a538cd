It's dropping below -5C here every night for the last two weeks.&nbsp; I'm running the sterilizer every day, and the pasteurizer once or twice a week after the sterilizer gets shut off.&nbsp; I doubt seriously that your winters are more severe than ours, since I've been to your city during January-March many times.&nbsp; I worked several winters on oil drilling rigs north of there, as a matter of fact.<br />If you want something small scale for indoors, simply use a large pot or PC and pasteurize in jars or bags as shown in the casing prep or manure prep video on my site.&nbsp; I thought you were wanting something bigger.<br />RR"}}
