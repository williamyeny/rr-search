You want four to five air exchanges per hour, not per day.&nbsp; That's why the shotgun terrarium works so well-you get constant fresh air. In the meantime, mist the cakes well and set them outside on the porch in direct sun for ten minutes or so.&nbsp; When you get your terrarium built, be sure your fluorescent lamp is no more than a few inches away.&nbsp; You want bright light.<br />RR"}}
