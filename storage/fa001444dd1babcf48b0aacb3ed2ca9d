Understand however, that lots of us, myself included don't incubate at 83 to 86, but rather at normal room temperature.  That means our incubation and fruiting temperatures are the same, and we still get fruits in the same time frame.  No temp drop.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing about wild fruitings.   They do come out a day or two after rains, but bear in mind, the southern regions get their summer rains from thunderstorms, where the temp might drop for an hour or so after the rain, but as soon as the sun comes out, it's as hot as before.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5407111</next>\n<prev>5405408</prev>\n<first>5403821</first>\n<last>5407111</last>\n<when>1142480795</when>\n<utime>03/16/06 05:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
