If you make the substrate and casing wet enough to last several flushes, it will be so soggy the mycelium will have a hard time colonizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to open up the tub to let more air in.  Mushrooms want lots of air, lots of humidity, and lots of water.  I'd suggest if the pins are small, carefully misting between them, or actually pouring water between them to wet the casing layer.  If the substrate is dry, you can pour water around the edges and actually fill up the tub partially, then pour off any excess a few hours later.  You can do the above during a flush at any time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6660857</next>\n<prev>6660597</prev>\n<first>6660525</first>\n<last>6660969</last>\n<when>1173709017</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 05:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
