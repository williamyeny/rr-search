{"key":"post-6207472","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6207472</id>\n<content>Light is one of the pinning triggers, but a minor one, and only after full colonization is reached.  The most important pinning trigger is full colonization of the substrate.  Second would be an increase in air exchange that brings about a reduction in CO2 levels.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After those two have been met, light and a steady evaporation of moisture from the substrate come into play.  A good pinning strategy brings all these into account simultaneously.  It's a good idea to provide a few days of darkness just before exposing to fruiting conditions, but darkness is not required during colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6208501</next>\n<prev>6207363</prev>\n<first>6202050</first>\n<last>6208709</last>\n<when>1161736988</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 03:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
