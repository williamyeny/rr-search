If you wish to bring the ph of your casings higher, you would want to use hydrated(water soluable) lime.  Limestone is for long term use, such as in a garden.  Casings, which flush for a month or so do not need long term ph adjustment.  They need short term, therefore hydrated lime is what you would want to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3984570</next>\n<prev>3984309</prev>\n<first>3984309</first>\n<last>3984806</last>\n<when>1112109273</when>\n<utime>03/29/05 05:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
