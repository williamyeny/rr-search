I'd suggest letting it go for a few days to a week and see what develops.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's best to take pictures of reflective objects with lamps shining from the sides at 45 degree angles, and the flash turned off.  This prevents the glare from coming back to the camera lense.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6776364</next>\n<prev>6775840</prev>\n<first>6774440</first>\n<last>6776364</last>\n<when>1176335039</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 02:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
