There is nothing wrong with the pf tek just because you had trouble with it.  The problem comes when new growers try to 'improve' on it and mess things up.  I have some pf jars going now made exactly by the recipe that are 10 days old and they're already 80% colonized at room temperature.<br />Pf jars also make excellent spawn to bulk.  Rye berries is my spawn of choice, but there's nothing at all wrong with the pf tek.  There's lots of ways to skin the cat in this hobby.<br />RR"}}
