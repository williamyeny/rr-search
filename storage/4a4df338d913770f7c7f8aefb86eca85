I would recommend boiling the jars in the water not touching the bottom of the pot for 30 minutes boiling then allow the jars to cool, boil again for another 30 minutes, allow to cool, and repeat a final time to be as sterile as a pressure cooker. Steam sterilizing can work well, but inconsistencies with temperature may lead to failure, which may explain why one of your jars cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can non-pressurized steam have inconsistencies with temperature?&amp;nbsp; It will be 212/100C no matter what at sea level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OP is obviously following an outdated and inaccurate technique.&amp;nbsp; Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek videos&lt;/a&gt; and follow them without deviation.&amp;nbsp; Everything is explained to make it as simple to follow as flushing the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15340208</next>\n<prev>15339334</prev>\n<first>15339012</first>\n<last>18974348</last>\n<when>1320771497</when>\n<utime>11/08/11 06:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
