It makes absolutely NO difference if the spores come from the same print or from prints from halfway around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The definition of a strain is NOT the name some vendor put on a print he mailed out.  The definition of a strain is two compatible hyphae 'mating' to form dikaryotic mycelium.  Hyphae from a PR print are just as capable of mating with each other as with hyphae from a Tex or any other print.  It's the same species so they're all compatible.  There is NO competition between strains of the same species.  Once they become dikaryotic, they continue to fuse by a process known as anastomosis, again with NO competition.  Hybridization between 'strains' occurs in every single multispore project.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382519</next>\n<prev>6382206</prev>\n<first>6382058</first>\n<last>6385235</last>\n<when>1166458181</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 06:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
