Perlite in a casing mix serves a different purpose.  It creates small air pockets that help to stimulate primordia formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said, aluminum pans stimulate side pinning by reflecting light down into the tray.  The mushsroom metabolites also disolve the aluminum.  Use black plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for your first grow, I'd recommend fruiting the 1/2 pint cakes as cakes in order to learn the mushroom life cycle.  Once you get that part down, experiment with bulk substrates on future grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drill several holes in your terrarium, whether you plan to fan or not.  Don't leave it sealed up without air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7026168</next>\n<prev>7025369</prev>\n<first>7024773</first>\n<last>7026168</last>\n<when>1181402253</when>\n<utime>06/09/07 06:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
