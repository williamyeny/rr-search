Hydrogen peroxide simplifies the whole process of growing fungi. There's no need to build a sterile laboratory, buy a special giant pressure cooker, or even construct a glove box. A low concentration of peroxide keeps out the contaminants, while allowing healthy growth of mushroom tissue. And as the mushroom tissue grows, it converts the peroxide to water and oxygen, leaving a clean, vigorous mushroom culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That sounds like a quote from rush wayne's little typewritten sheet he sells on his website.  It's pure bullshit, trust me.  Peroxide is greatly overrated thanks to him and that bs pamplet he peddles.  Peroxide will kill cobweb mold, but that's about all it's good for.  It damages mushroom mycelium as much as it damages most molds, so it's worthless and certainly not a substitute for sterile procedure or a pressure cooker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not bad to gargle with if you have a sore throat though, although salt water is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6849981</next>\n<prev>6849738</prev>\n<first>6849707</first>\n<last>6850293</last>\n<when>1177883550</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 12:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
