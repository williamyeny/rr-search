The syrige can supply as much water as a casing layer.  Just don't make the cake waterlogged.  Inject whenever your intuition tells you the substrate is thirsty.  Over time, you can develop a pretty good feel for picking up a tray and 'reading' the moisture content by the weight.   The advantage is a quicker flush and there's no casing layer to contaminate.  The disadvantage is in somewhat smaller pinset, which wax paper might help to fix.<br />RR"}}
