{"key":"post-3975419","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3975419</id>\n<content>I don't know about jiffy mix, but hydrated lime generally IS calcium carbonate or equivalent.  It is not a buffer.  It will raise the ph.  A buffer is used to resist changes in ph.  An excellent buffer is gypsum.  For peat based casings, I add 1/2 tablespoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat in the mix.   Don't count the verm when figuring out how much lime to use.  For coir(which I hate as a casing material) use half that amount.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3975431</next>\n<prev>3975409</prev>\n<first>3975219</first>\n<last>3975431</last>\n<when>1111935003</when>\n<utime>03/27/05 04:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
