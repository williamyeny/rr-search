{"key":"post-10596669","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>10596669</id>\n<content>I've noticed after a few thousand cycles, the nozzle and weight interface wears out and the full 15 psi won't be reached.&amp;nbsp; The less you let the weight rattle, the longer it will last.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I let the weight &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; rattle.&amp;nbsp; You'll notice about .5 psi before it rattles, a slow hiss will come from the nozzle/weight.&amp;nbsp; Turn down the stove and try to keep it at that point and it will run for hours on only 1 inch of water.&amp;nbsp; This will give you 14.5 psi, which is where I run my 921s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a strong believer in spare parts, so always keep a spare gauge, nozzle and weight in stock.&amp;nbsp; I'd order one of each and put the gauge on and see what it reads.&amp;nbsp; If the new gauge reads 15 psi, send the old one back for warranty replacement.&amp;nbsp; If the new gauge reads like the old one, replace the nozzle and weight assembly together, and then if 15 psi is reached, send the old ones back for warranty replacement.&amp;nbsp; One or the other is off, and I wouldn't settle for anything less than 100% accuracy if it's brand new.&amp;nbsp; AA pressure cookers are the best in the business, but manufacturing defects still can occur from time to time, just like with a brand new car.&amp;nbsp; Get them to make it right.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10597360</next>\n<prev>10596545</prev>\n<first>10568989</first>\n<last>10673816</last>\n<when>1246372357</when>\n<utime>06/30/09 05:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
