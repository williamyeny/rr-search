The weight and density causes the brf to pack down tight near the bottom and that part doesn't colonize.  Stick to 1/2 pints and stack them later after colonzation if you want a larger substrate.  Pints work, but not as well as halfs, and certainly not as well as two 1/2 pints stacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When not using the pressure cooker, I steam 1/2 pints for 90 minutes.  It doesn't overcook them by any means, and it insures the mold spores and bacteria have been executed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7604931</next>\n<prev>7604879</prev>\n<first>7604733</first>\n<last>7606378</last>\n<when>1194410457</when>\n<utime>11/07/07 06:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
