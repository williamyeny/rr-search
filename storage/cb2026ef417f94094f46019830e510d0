I sleep with a window open, even during winter.&nbsp; In fact, it was 10F here on Easter Sunday morning. Simply put the terrarium near a sunny window and it will heat up during the daytime that way.&nbsp; Alternatively, even a 6500K CFL puts out some heat.&nbsp; Make sure it's close enough to the terrarium to provide heating during the 12 hours it's on. 60F at night is fine.<br />The humidity is provided by air filtering up through the perlite.&nbsp; The perlite is constantly refreshed by the overspray when you mist your cakes, so you don't need to do anything extra.<br />RR"}}
