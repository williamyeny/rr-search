(so watch out for it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you can enlighten us on what mold contaminants of mushroom culture cause nausea or death when eaten, because in all my years of growing, I haven't encountered any.  Blue mold is penicillium, which blue cheese salad dressing and most antibiotics are based on.  Green molds are trichoderma and apsergillis, both common and floating all over yours and my house, not hurting anybody.  Black molds can be sickening if spores are INHALED.   Don't spread disinformation if you don't know the answeres please.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6566251</next>\n<prev>6566076</prev>\n<first>6565536</first>\n<last>6570062</last>\n<when>1171474696</when>\n<utime>02/14/07 07:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
