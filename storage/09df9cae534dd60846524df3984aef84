I've long felt it was from very rapid growth, but other times you can flood the substrate and get fast growth without the caps splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember it's a different phenomena than cracked caps which give the caps a dinosaur/reptile type look.  Cracked caps are from low humidity and also really don't hurt anything.  In fact, many Shiitake growers deliberately lower humidity a day or two before harvest to crack the caps.  They feel it leads to a better product and in Japan, cracked cap Shiitake brings a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6400316</prev>\n<first>6397215</first>\n<last>6400359</last>\n<when>1166930396</when>\n<utime>12/24/06 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
