Bacteria in relatively small amounts are beneficial in bulk substrates AND casing layers. It's not just about contamination, although that's a fringe benefit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why we &lt;i&gt;pasteurize&lt;/i&gt; bulk substrates.  We're trying to kill the &lt;u&gt;mold spores&lt;/u&gt;, which die at anything much above 125F or so.  Mold will ruin your bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; mold will ruin your spawn, so that's why we sterilize our grains.  I've answered this exact question a few hundred times already.  I'm sorry you feel it's so clear folks with the right answer aren't too knowledgeable.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8482260</next>\n<prev>8480454</prev>\n<first>8479858</first>\n<last>8482260</last>\n<when>1212545119</when>\n<utime>06/04/08 05:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
