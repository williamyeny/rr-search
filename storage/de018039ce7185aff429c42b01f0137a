It is not required or in my opinion even desirable to have the coolmist outside the greenhouse.  It is also not required to use the coolmist for fresh air exchange. A humidifier is designed to provide &lt;i&gt;humidity&lt;/i&gt;.  I run two coolmists inside my greenhouse, which is equal in size to three or four marthas, and I've been running the same two for well over a year without a failure.  Prior to that, I was going through them every couple of months when trying to pipe in the humid air from outside, and once you modify the humidifier with hoses, you can't return it to the store for a refund when it shits the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's extremely easy to get plenty of FAE in a greenhouse by simply leaving holes open in the sides, and/or the door cracked.  This gives continuous air exchange as opposed to just when the humidifier is running.  By placing the humidifier directly inside the greenhouse, it needs to run FAR less than it would on the outside, cutting down on drips within.   For a tub, you don't need perlite or a humidifier with cased bulk substrates.  They will provide plenty of humidity on their own as moisture evaporates from the casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5650831</next>\n<prev>5650541</prev>\n<first>5650472</first>\n<last>5651304</last>\n<when>1148074373</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 12:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
