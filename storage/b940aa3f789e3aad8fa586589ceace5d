Anywhere from 5% to 10% is fine. Lime isn't necessary in bulk substrates, but don't forget to use it if/when you use a casing layer.  It's necessary for casing material because it doesn't fully colonize with mushroom mycelium, and therefore the uncolonized parts are susceptible to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom size, provided you used a good substrate is related to moisture content.  If you had coir/coffee then you had a good substrate.  I'd speculate the small fruits were related to not having enough moisture.  Next time, dunk after full colonization.  I like to make my substrates up a tad on the dry side because they colonize faster that way and are less prone to contamination.  Then, at full colonization, give a 6 hour dunk to re-hydrate the substrate before placing into fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6853532</next>\n<prev>6853184</prev>\n<first>6853184</first>\n<last>6857631</last>\n<when>1177951644</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 07:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
