They're pre-cut to size and last thousands of uses.  The price of 35 to 40 cents each is offset by how long you'll be using them.  I'm sure they'll outlast several sets of jars and lids.<br />I've also cut up tyvek coveralls that you can buy at your home megacenter.  Each pair of $5 coveralls will give well over 100 large wide mouth filters.  Don't steal the post office stuff.<br />RR"}}
