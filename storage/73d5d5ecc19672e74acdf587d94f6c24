It's better than brf because the bran is only the inside of the rice after the hull has been stripped off.  The hulls are better for humans because they have the fiber, but the rice bran is more nutritious for fungi.  I use rice bran also when making wood/sawdust substrates as a nutrient boost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5946896</prev>\n<first>5946716</first>\n<last>5947212</last>\n<when>1155146824</when>\n<utime>08/09/06 09:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
