There should be no steam entering or exiting the jars during the process.  The steam doesn't 'enter' the jar to provide the 15psi, rather the pressure in the jar rises as the pressure in the vessel rises due to temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pop the weight or anything else to speed up the pressure drop at the end of the cycle, you'll damage the filters, but if you allow pressure to bleed off slowly, there won't be any exchange through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After pressure has gone to zero, as the jar cools the contents shrink slightly.  If the lid is loose, contaminants can be drawn in under the filter rather than being filtered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's no secret that I hate incubators, and also hate incubating mycelium in a closed box even if without extra heat.  Lots of CO2 is produced as the mycelium colonizes a substrate, and if the jars are in the bottom of a box or tit type tub, they wallow in it.  In addition, temperatures above 80F favor molds and thermophilic bacteria over mushroom mycelium.  In my experience and opinion, it's better to wait an extra day or two for jars to colonize than to invest in a heated box that is likely to cause the very problems we're trying to avoid.  Make your room comfortable for you to wear shorts and a shirt, and your mycelium will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria is endemic to grains, and that's why we must sterilize.  Simple pasteurization kills mold spores.  Bacteria also is floating in the air everywhere, especially in the area right in front of us due to the bacteria in our own breath, so always wear a surgical mask and gloves.  Next cycle, leave three or four jars uninoculated.  If the others contaminate with wetspot, but your control jars do not, you know the source of the problem is in your inoculation procedure or product.  If all jars contaminate as they have been, you'll know it's something with your sterilization/filter process.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6183065</next>\n<prev>6182094</prev>\n<first>6178352</first>\n<last>6183065</last>\n<when>1161204221</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 11:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
