They cause far more problems with members than they solve.  I haven't used one in years.  Jars colonize very well at 75F. They might colonize slightly faster at 80F, but not much.  Bacteria and thermophillic molds are stimulated at higher temperatures, so I've had a FAR lower contamination rate from using room temperature, even if it takes an extra three or four days to colonize a quart of rye.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6770440</next>\n<prev>6770327</prev>\n<first>6770327</first>\n<last>6770581</last>\n<when>1176235381</when>\n<utime>04/10/07 11:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
