I've done the same thing numerous times and have gotten away with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have made it home from the bar slobbering drunk too, but it's not wise to recommend for others to do.  Perhaps mold doesn't grow fast when it's 10 percent humidity, but neither do mushrooms, and that's why we use fruiting chambers at 99%.  Those mold spores are going to love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contaminated ANYTHING should be removed from your house as soon as its spotted.  The billions of spores that were released from that thing are going to haunt you for years to come, regardless of how much bleach, etc., you use.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6893773</next>\n<prev>6893211</prev>\n<first>6892774</first>\n<last>6897485</last>\n<when>1178730730</when>\n<utime>05/09/07 08:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
