Its like rule one . Do not open while hot.</blockquote><br />You'd be amazed at how many new growers actually do that and then post later wondering why their jars are too dry to colonize.&nbsp; This problem was so common a few years ago, that I felt compelled to mention it each time I demonstrated the pressure cooker.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />He's not even talking about moisture content... If you pull of the weight you'll blow your jars up.</blockquote><br />Actually, it's ALL about moisture content.&nbsp; It won't blow your jars up because they have holes in the lids for gas exchange.&nbsp; The pressure inside the jars will vent through the holes, thus taking the moisture out with it(and possibly ruining the filter material).&nbsp; The jars may crack from rapid cooling, but won't blow up.<br />RR"}}
