You can't treat an uncased substrate like it was a casing.  If you did, you'd 'initiate' fruiting when the mycelium first reached the surface, while the rest of the substrate was still largely uncolonized.  Such will lead to disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With uncased substrate, wait for full colonization, then place in the fruiting chamber.  Try to keep humidity at 99%, since uncased substrates should be treated as cakes.  Remember, when using a casing layer, we keep the humidity a bit lower to allow some evaporation from the casing, which is replaced by daily mistings.  A piece of wax paper layed loosely over the uncased substrate will help produce a micro-climate conducive to fruiting, but remember that even though it helps, wax paper is no substitute for a genuine casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5679926</next>\n<prev>5679741</prev>\n<first>5672771</first>\n<last>5708524</last>\n<when>1148737786</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 04:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
