It isn't a cureall for sloppy technique so you still have to be careful.  Also, never get your hands between the flowhood and your open jar or it will blow contaminants from you to your work.  Most important is to never open a contaminated petri dish in front of the flowhood. Always use a glovebox for those.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5977640</next>\n<prev>5977560</prev>\n<first>5977560</first>\n<last>5977640</last>\n<when>1155968964</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 09:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
