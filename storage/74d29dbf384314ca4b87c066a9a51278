Look for piles of straw and manure near stables.  What you want is the stuff they piled up last year.  A year of sun and rain will render it perfect.  <br />Be sure to collect the manure on a very dry day when it's been dry for long enough to ensure that what you collect is totally dry.  If you bring damp manure in a bag into your apartment, it will mold.<br />RR"}}
