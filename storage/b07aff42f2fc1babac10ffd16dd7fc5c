Jars of grains will still colonize great at 35F, it just takes longer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved to a cabin in the mountains, and all of my colonizing jars were moved from normal room temp to an unheated storage shed outside when there was still two feet of snow on the ground.  Temperatures were below freezing the whole time.  When I opened the boxes of jars two months later, all of them were fully colonized, and none were contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, room temp works GREAT for colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8419773</next>\n<prev>8419301</prev>\n<first>8418536</first>\n<last>8423729</last>\n<when>1211209496</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 06:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
