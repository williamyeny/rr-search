Be sure to wash the cakes under the faucet before and after the dunk, but before rolling in the dry vermiculite. Look up the 'dunk and roll' tek and follow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bluing is a sign of the cake being too dry.  Those lumps are not hyphal knots.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6680726</next>\n<prev>6680237</prev>\n<first>6680179</first>\n<last>6681689</last>\n<when>1174161962</when>\n<utime>03/17/07 11:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
