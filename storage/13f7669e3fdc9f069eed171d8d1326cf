I'd give it an hour or two at 350F to 400F.  Perlite is made at very high temps so it won't hurt it.  After it cools, just rinse and reuse.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6954743</next>\n<prev>6954608</prev>\n<first>6954196</first>\n<last>6958103</last>\n<when>1179899567</when>\n<utime>05/23/07 08:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
