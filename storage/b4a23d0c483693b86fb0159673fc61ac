I see no real benefit for home growers because the mycelium can only make so many cell divisions before senescence, so you just cut out a grain transfer and do a manure transfer which is more prone to contamination.  It's already a race to colonize bulk projects before mold sets in, so when you manure to manure transfer, you double the exposure.   <br />In addition, the grain is a substantial part of the substrate, so when you do a manure to manure transfer, you half the amount of grain in each.<br />RR"}}
