It is leaving divots in the substrate. What to do if you are not someone who cases. The casing is in a metal cooking pot. Should he harvest everything in a day or so and dunk? or let it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a bit confused by your post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You say it's uncased, but then say the 'casing' is in a metal cooking pot.&amp;nbsp; Which is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid divots, you can slice the mushrooms off at the surface with a large knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick the fruits as they're ready.&amp;nbsp; You can soak the substrate at any time by flooding the tray with water, and then pouring the excess off again in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10473791</next>\n<prev>10473046</prev>\n<first>10473046</first>\n<last>10478688</last>\n<when>1244512747</when>\n<utime>06/09/09 04:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
