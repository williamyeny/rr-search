(avoid it with 1/2 pints)&nbsp; You can also use 1\" of perlite in the bottom of the PC, but it's kind of messy.&nbsp; <br />Don't lay jars on their sides unless they're above other jars, such as in the AA-921, you can do 7 quart jars standing up, and 3 more laying down on top of those seven.<br />If water is getting in, it sounds like perhaps you forgot to cover the tops with foil during sterilization.<br />RR"}}
