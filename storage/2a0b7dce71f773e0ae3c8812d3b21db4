It matters little if a jar is 'colonized' in six days or two weeks, if colonization is merely defined as turning fully white.  What matters is total harvest.  Most have noticed both a higher rate of contaminants and lesser harvests with massive spore inoculation over using less spores or a liquid isolate as agar suggested.  Of course, there are always exceptions, but my experience has been that in the majority of cases, less spores are better.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4586781</prev>\n<first>4586625</first>\n<last>4586783</last>\n<when>1125148464</when>\n<utime>08/27/05 04:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
