Perlite works by evaporating moisture from its surface into the air, so any perlite that is under water is totally useless.  Get the perlite wet, then drain well and place two to three inches deep in your terrarium.  You'll see your humidity go to 99%.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6344503</next>\n<prev>6344135</prev>\n<first>6344089</first>\n<last>6344549</last>\n<when>1165515333</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 08:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
