Maintain near 100% humidity throughout the fruiting cycle, while also providing plenty of air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't have standing water in your FC.  In fact, I'd recommend drilling holes in the floor of the FC.  Air that filters up through the holes will become humidified, thus providing humidity and air exchange at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7157955</next>\n<prev>7157017</prev>\n<first>7156556</first>\n<last>7158007</last>\n<when>1184116011</when>\n<utime>07/11/07 04:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
