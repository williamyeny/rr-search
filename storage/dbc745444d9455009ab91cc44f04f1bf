Bags don't colonize or anything else, the substrate or grains within do. Filter patch bags are used for everything from grain spawn to compost to sawdust/woodchips. If it's a grain based bag, you want a plenum of air on top of the grains and to have it exposed to air so gasses can exchange.  I'd recommend keeping it on a shelf rather than in a drawer or box.<br />RR"}}
