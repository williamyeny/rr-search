It can be hazardous to your lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed this the first time.&amp;nbsp; If you get pellet gypsum, dissolve it in water and then use the slurry.&amp;nbsp; Any dust can be harmful, simply by trashing our lungs.&amp;nbsp; I always wear a mask and ear plugs when mowing the lawn or even when chopping straw.&amp;nbsp; Be safe, not sorry.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm almost 60 and have better lung capacity than most teenagers. In fact, last year I raced three US Army Rangers up Mt. Si near Seattle and beat all three of them to the tip of the summit(the 'haystack' for those of you who know) by about 1/4 mile. I don't smoke and never have, and climb mountains weekly.&amp;nbsp; Part of staying healthy is exercise, and the other part is not breaking the parts of us that don't wear out on their own.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11931326</next>\n<prev>11931017</prev>\n<first>11929495</first>\n<last>11940797</last>\n<when>1264898019</when>\n<utime>01/31/10 02:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
