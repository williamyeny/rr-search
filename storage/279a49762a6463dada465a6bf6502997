I pour it when the agar has cooled just to the point where I can handle it without heat protection for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whiskey bottle with a screw on lid is perfect.  Drill a 1/4&quot; hole in the lid and either cut a synthetic filter disk to fit, a piece of tyvek, or stuff the hole with polyfill and cover the top with foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pc malt extract for 40 minutes, but 30 will usually suffice.  Mix the dry ingredients with room temperature water, then pc.  You don't want the agar to solidify in the jars.  You want to pour it into petri dishes and have it finish cooling in the dishes and solidfiy there. It's normal when you remove the bottle from the pc for some of the powder to be collected in the bottom of your bottle.  Swirl it around while still warm to mix it well, then pour into the dishes. You also forgot to add the yeast.  I use 2 grams per liter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6686537</prev>\n<first>6683822</first>\n<last>6686741</last>\n<when>1174325838</when>\n<utime>03/19/07 08:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
