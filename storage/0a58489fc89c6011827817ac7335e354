I spray a 12 X 12 room for one minute with a can in each hand, then wait about ten minutes for it to settle before beginning work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyvek suits and masks are great for sterile work with grains, but once colonized, spawning them to bulk only requires you to be clean, not sterile.  Bacteria is not generally a contaminant of bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7967852</next>\n<prev>7967780</prev>\n<first>7967575</first>\n<last>7970997</last>\n<when>1201965321</when>\n<utime>02/02/08 05:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
