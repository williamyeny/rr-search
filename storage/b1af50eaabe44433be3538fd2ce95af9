I recommend 1 teaspoon of hydrated per cup of peat as a starting point because that's rarely too much.  The best thing is to get some pH strips to measure it properly.  I also add gypsum at ten percent by volume to the amount of the peat moss. Mix the dry ingredients first, and then hydrate and pasteurize as per RK's link above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6914044</next>\n<prev>6913812</prev>\n<first>6913753</first>\n<last>6916884</last>\n<when>1179166224</when>\n<utime>05/14/07 09:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
