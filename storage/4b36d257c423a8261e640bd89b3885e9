Vermiculite is an excellent moisture reservoir, that holds more water for its size than anything else.  Any substrate, including sawdust/woodchips or manure can benefit from the addition of vermiculite.  There is also no other method of growing that can grow more mushrooms on less substrate than pf cakes.  That's a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't find any of the old timers trashing pf tek.  It's not about ego, it's about more than one way to skin a cat.  Pf cakes have the highest BE of any growing method, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't replace verm with potting soil.  They're apples and oranges.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6816715</next>\n<prev>6816456</prev>\n<first>6814660</first>\n<last>6819906</last>\n<when>1177200527</when>\n<utime>04/22/07 03:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
