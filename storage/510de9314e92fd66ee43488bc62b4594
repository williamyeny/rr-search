If you plan to grow more in the future, I would never recommend handling a substrate with a trichoderma bloom anywhere near your home, clothes or yourself.  You'll simply release too many contaminant spores into your growing area that will bite your butt later.  It's too easy to start a new substrate and practice until you learn proper sterile technique.  Molds are introduced at inoculation, so screwing around with contaminated product insures that there will be more contaminants in the air next time you work than last time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5733325</next>\n<prev>5733080</prev>\n<first>5679863</first>\n<last>5734007</last>\n<when>1149940125</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 02:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
