Four 1/8\" holes is plenty.   In addition, manure is a bulk substrate.  It needs to be used in bulk, not small 1/2 pint amounts.  BRF will go much farther in a small jar than manure.  You also want to use roughly half as much water as verm, so you were dry to begin with, and then those huge holes in the lid dried it out the rest of the way.  <br />RR"}}
