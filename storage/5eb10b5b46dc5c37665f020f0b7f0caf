If you want a good pinset, you need for your substrate to be losing mosture, not sucking it up from the perlite.  I've seen cakes and bulks get over saturated that way, and they either perform poorly or not at all.  Best to let the moisture evaporate from your substrate, then dunk between flushes.<br />RR"}}
