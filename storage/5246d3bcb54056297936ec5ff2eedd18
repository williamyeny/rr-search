I'll also take one or two bags out of each batch to G2G for the next batch.&amp;nbsp; At around the time of the 3rd G2G we'll inoculate a new grain master from a petri dish.&amp;nbsp; By the time the first batch has reached 5 grain to grain transfers, the new grain masters are ready for their first.&amp;nbsp; This keeps the cycle going indefinitely provided one keeps master culture slants in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>17451680</prev>\n<first>17449547</first>\n<last>17452749</last>\n<when>1356581657</when>\n<utime>12/27/12 06:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
