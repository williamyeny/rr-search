In other words, if you're using a jar, treat it like a grain jar.  I use a whiskey bottle with a filter in the lid for agar because it's easier to pour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour the dishes after the agar has cooled, but before it's solidified.  I wait until I don't need an insulated glove or pot holder to protect my hands from the heat.  This will prevent condensation.  Pour the dishes in a vertical stack, and then slip the sleeve back over them as protection while they cool.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7153994</next>\n<prev>7153712</prev>\n<first>7153712</first>\n<last>10916928</last>\n<when>1184038587</when>\n<utime>07/10/07 06:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
