Bags don't colonize or anything else, the substrate or grains within do. Filter patch bags are used for everything from grain spawn to compost to sawdust/woodchips. If it's a grain based bag, you want a plenum of air on top of the grains and to have it exposed to air so gasses can exchange.  I'd recommend keeping it on a shelf rather than in a drawer or box.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6171442</next>\n<prev>6171223</prev>\n<first>6168994</first>\n<last>6171442</last>\n<when>1160926974</when>\n<utime>10/15/06 06:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
