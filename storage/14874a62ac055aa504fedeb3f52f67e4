( I rarely use all 20 in one pour which requires a transfer to a ziploc bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't say that i know 100% that the dishes aren't sterile, but with agar being so susceptible to contam, i don't risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through several cases of 500 petri dishes per year and have NEVER had one come out of the bag non-sterile, nor have I ever seen a sleeve that was torn or otherwise nicked.&amp;nbsp; If you are, you're not getting dishes from a reputable source.&amp;nbsp; cynmar.com has cases of 500 three section dishes for under a hundred dollars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12202813</next>\n<prev>12202652</prev>\n<first>12200818</first>\n<last>12202813</last>\n<when>1268619727</when>\n<utime>03/15/10 05:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
