I suppose if it's good enough to drink it's good enough for growing unless it has too many minerals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise against using the microwave on casing.  It will get too hot, partially sterilizing the material rather than pasteurizing, which is selective for beneficial bacteria.  Pasteurizing is done at a much lower temperature over a longer time, so as to preserve the good guys while killing off the mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6042394</prev>\n<first>6042388</first>\n<last>6042553</last>\n<when>1157772325</when>\n<utime>09/09/06 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
