I don't see anything in that picture that looks like mushroom mycelium or cobweb mycelium either one.  I do see some very tiny white dots.  They looks somewhat like trichoderma before it turns green.  Keep a close eye on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5935702</next>\n<prev>5935625</prev>\n<first>5935603</first>\n<last>5935770</last>\n<when>1154839787</when>\n<utime>08/06/06 07:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
