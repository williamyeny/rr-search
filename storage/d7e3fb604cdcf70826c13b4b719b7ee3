{"key":"post-5874330","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5874330</id>\n<content>I have tyvek sleeves instead of gloves installed in my glovebox so I can remove my hands as needed to keep the alcohol lamp on the outside.  I use the tyvek sleeves and latex gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you set up, just remember to keep the air inside still.  If you use sleeves like I do instead of installed gloves, be sure to shut off all fans, AC units, etc., that could cause drafts in the room.  Soap and water is good enough to clean the box.  I don't use flammable materials in mine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874412</next>\n<prev>5874016</prev>\n<first>5873356</first>\n<last>5876374</last>\n<when>1153265850</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 02:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
