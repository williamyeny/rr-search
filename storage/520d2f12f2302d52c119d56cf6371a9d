I only soaked one after pulling all the mushies on it, 2 days later there is like 50 knots on the surface.... whats the deal with that. it is messing with my timing,as there are mushrooms at all stages booming in 5 seperate containers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term 'flush' is a man-made word and the mycelium doesn't always cooperate with what we expect.&amp;nbsp; Many strains don't fruit in neat flushes, but instead supply a steady stream of pins.&amp;nbsp; Just pour a bit of water on top or around the edges of the substrate if necessary to keep them hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17490892</next>\n<prev>17490201</prev>\n<first>17485335</first>\n<last>17536638</last>\n<when>1357218838</when>\n<utime>01/03/13 03:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
