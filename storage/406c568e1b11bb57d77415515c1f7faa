{"key":"post-6742624","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6742624</id>\n<content>I've found that on every instance where trich shows up during casing run, it was in the spawn prior to casing.  Sometimes the mushroom mycelium 'over runs' it and the trichoderma is hidden, but still there.  Once it gets a bit of air during spawning, it comes to life with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important NOT to sterilize bulk subs like coir.  You didn't state your methods, but sterilizing substrates or casing material is a recipe for disaster because the first spore to land on a sterile medium takes off and grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to pH balance your substrates and casing to an initial pH of 8 to 8.5 because trichoderma grows best in a pH of 4 to 6, which is exactly what coir and peat moss are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb is easy to kill with three sprayings 12 hours apart of 3% peroxide, so it's not really a problem.  Air exchange is the key to preventing both trich and cobweb after first flush, but prior to first flush it requires contaminant free spawn or pf cakes and a proper pH.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6745532</next>\n<prev>6742580</prev>\n<first>6742496</first>\n<last>6766125</last>\n<when>1175633857</when>\n<utime>04/03/07 11:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
