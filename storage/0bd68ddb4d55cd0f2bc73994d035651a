Therefore, a 450 CFM blower will deliver 100 linear feet per minute across your work area assuming no loss.  I'd recommend 600 CFM to 900 CFM for that size filter.  You can always block off part of the intake if you have too much air, but if you don't have enough air to create proper static pressure in the plenum behind the filter, you won't get laminar flow in your work area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5460247</prev>\n<first>5457210</first>\n<last>5461003</last>\n<when>1143767449</when>\n<utime>03/31/06 03:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
