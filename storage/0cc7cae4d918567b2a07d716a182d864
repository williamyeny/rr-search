They should recover normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell for sure if it's bluing or a contaminant by looking at the cake with a magnifying glass.  If the mycelium is blue, it's bruising.  If the color is sitting on TOP of the mycelium as a distinct layer, it's a contaminant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6253085</next>\n<prev>6251301</prev>\n<first>6251301</first>\n<last>6253085</last>\n<when>1162834695</when>\n<utime>11/06/06 07:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
