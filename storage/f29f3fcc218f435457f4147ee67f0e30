I've even dipped wild cultures into ten percent bleach solution before cloning. Peroxide is another story though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleach is effective against bacteria, but since bacteria isn't a contaminant of fruiting substrates, there is no reason to dunk in it.&amp;nbsp; Molds contaminate fruiting substrates and bleach won't bother mold.&amp;nbsp; Peroxide destroys microbes at the cellular level, which isn't good for bacteria or fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mixing bleach with water, you can add an equal amount of vinegar(same amount as bleach) to lower the pH, making it more effective as a surface disinfectant.&amp;nbsp; I use that mixture whenever I bleach bomb my lab or grow room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it should go without saying to keep bleach off your fruiting trays.&amp;nbsp; It does nasty things to mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13832332</next>\n<prev>13826545</prev>\n<first>13821063</first>\n<last>13832332</last>\n<when>1295649861</when>\n<utime>01/22/11 12:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
