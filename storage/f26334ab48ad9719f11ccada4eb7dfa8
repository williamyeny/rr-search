But question is, how long will I be able to fruit from one set of cakes that I have? Can I theoretically keep dunk n rolling them time and time again? Or does the mycelium die and have a limit to its amount of flush depending on strain/species? Of course for my question its for cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outdoors in a flower bed I've seen cakes continue to flush until they're about 1/10 the original size.&amp;nbsp; Indoors, green molds always seem to get the cakes first.&amp;nbsp; This is why we try to nail all the fruiting parameters early to get the most amount of product before green molds naturally take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big impedance to multiple flushes is allowing spores to drop.&amp;nbsp; When the mushrooms mature all the way to flat caps with spores everywhere, the mycelium gets the message that its life-cycle is complete and it begins to die back.&amp;nbsp; This is when green molds have easy access to your remaining substrate because the mushroom mycelium has given up on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>19034283</prev>\n<first>19029226</first>\n<last>19034355</last>\n<when>1382790031</when>\n<utime>10/26/13 03:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
