Heated in oven for 2 hours at 170. This should effectively pasteruate right? And a bread tie to close the oven bag should be okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hours in the oven at 170 won't get your substrate anywhere near proper pasteurization temp.&amp;nbsp; Don't attempt to use the oven to pasteurize.&amp;nbsp; Air is a horrible heat conductor.&amp;nbsp; Use steam or boiling water and start your 90 minute time when the center of your substrate reaches 140F, and don't let it exceed 160F during this time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16937099</next>\n<prev>16937041</prev>\n<first>16937010</first>\n<last>16938010</last>\n<when>1349020742</when>\n<utime>09/30/12 06:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
