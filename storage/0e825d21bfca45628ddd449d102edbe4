Even large cities have those, and rich folks with horses in the back yard.  Getting rid of the manure is always a problem with horse owners, so if you knock on the door to a house with horses out back, shovel and bag in hand, they will greet you as a hero, trust me.  Get the weather bleached nuggets from the middle of the pasture, not the stuff mixed with cedar chips they shovel out of the barns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most large cities also have a mounted police division.  You can go right to the police department stables, bag in hand, and ask for manure for your garden.  Don't worry about answering questions.  They'll be too busy pointing you to the pile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6106623</next>\n<prev>6106487</prev>\n<first>6102741</first>\n<last>6106623</last>\n<when>1159371941</when>\n<utime>09/27/06 06:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
