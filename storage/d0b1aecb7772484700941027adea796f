A flowhood produces a very gentle stream of airflow at 100 feet per minute or so.  A proper flowhood will bend the flame of a cig lighter, but not blow it out. You work right in front of the flowhood with your work right up next to the filter.  I run the flowhood for an hour or so before I begin work with the door to the room closed.  This cleans the room air very well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4126854</next>\n<prev>4126039</prev>\n<first>4122901</first>\n<last>4229745</last>\n<when>1115127086</when>\n<utime>05/03/05 04:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
