We have to keep in mind that mushroom cultivation is still in its infancy and there's been a LOT learned about it just in the time I've been growing them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we do know is that sterilized substrates perform poorly, and some species won't fruit at all on sterile substrates.&amp;nbsp; In addition, sterile substrates contaminate much easier than pasteurized ones.&amp;nbsp; That works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I misunderstood your original post. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/blush.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:blush:&quot; title=&quot;:blush:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9402493</next>\n<prev>9400449</prev>\n<first>9395387</first>\n<last>9402493</last>\n<when>1228869358</when>\n<utime>12/10/08 02:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
