If it was fully colonized, and stayed contamination free in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on species.&amp;nbsp; However, you should never let a petri dish fully colonize.&amp;nbsp; I've seen mycelium crawl out between the lid and base, colonize through the parafilm or other wrap, and then become contaminated when exposed to air.&amp;nbsp; Use refrigeration to prevent the mycelium from colonizing the last 1/4&quot; or so of the petri dish agar surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bear in mind, many tropical species hate refrigeration and don't last long.&amp;nbsp; For these species, room temperature(or slightly cooler) storage of slants is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>16529883</prev>\n<first>16527708</first>\n<last>16529921</last>\n<when>1342285694</when>\n<utime>07/14/12 08:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
