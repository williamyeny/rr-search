Trichoderma mycelium is white and probably permeated all through the substrate.&amp;nbsp; I'd take the infected trays outside and bury in a shady spot along with some manure or coir.&amp;nbsp; Use storebought cow manure if you need to-it works fine in the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use a 1/8&quot; drill bit, but you'll have to drill four times as many holes.&amp;nbsp; 1/4&quot; holes are recommended, which have four times the area of a 1/8&quot; hole.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8556845</next>\n<prev>8556328</prev>\n<first>8526712</first>\n<last>8566469</last>\n<when>1214281105</when>\n<utime>06/24/08 07:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
