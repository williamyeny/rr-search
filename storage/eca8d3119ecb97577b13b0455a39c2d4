Placing anything over a heating pad and leaving it in one spot is a fire hazzard because of hot spots that can and will develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply having a nice warm room is safest yet. Find a place where it's easy to keep the temperature at 78F to 82F, and everything from spawn jars to bulk substrates can sit on shelves with good air circulation and do well.  It's no secret that I'm not a fan of incubators in tubs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6181281</prev>\n<first>6180834</first>\n<last>6181285</last>\n<when>1161166487</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 01:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
