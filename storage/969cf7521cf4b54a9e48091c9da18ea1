{"key":"post-5870210","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5870210</id>\n<content>I suggest putting the filter on the outside of the jar so it can dry off quickly after the PC session.  Also, try using three or four 1/16&quot; holes instead of one large one.  By using smaller holes, the grains won't come into contact with your filter when you shake.  A filter that is wet with grain juice is an invitation for bacterial contamination.  I learned this the hard way from using plastic lids where the filters were inside the jar.  I had a bacterial contamination rate of nearly ten percent.  After switching to the method described above, the problem went away.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874027</next>\n<prev>5870184</prev>\n<first>5870184</first>\n<last>5875333</last>\n<when>1153181399</when>\n<utime>07/18/06 03:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
