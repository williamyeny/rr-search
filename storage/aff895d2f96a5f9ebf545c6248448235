Automotive battery chargers work well because they have a six or twelve volt switch.  A 30 watt resistor would be huge.  Actually, it would be less than 30 watts if a 5 ohm resistor was used in series with the motor, it would be 15 watt.  However a 5 ohm, 15 watt resistor isn't exactly off the shelf stuff.<br />RR"}}
