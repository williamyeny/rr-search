One reason is that colonization is slowed down somewhat in a high CO2 environment and this helps prevent the mycelium from consuming the substrate rather than colonizing it. You'll have much more of your substrate available for the fruiting stage if you keep a high CO2 level during colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the CO2 drop is a major pinning trigger, thus if it's applied at the time of the other triggers such as bright light and evaporation of moisture from the substrate, you'll get a more even pinset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that providing FAE during colonization rather than simple gas exchange will speed up colonization, but it's not beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14191184</next>\n<prev>14190936</prev>\n<first>10713572</first>\n<last>27284080</last>\n<when>1301233732</when>\n<utime>03/27/11 04:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
