For example, as humans grow, they produce more cells. As a fetus reaches maturity in the womb, it's multiplied its cells from the zygote stage to term exponentially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, the cells in a mushroom simply swell with water as they grow. A fully mature mushroom has the same amount of cells (and thus, psilocybin content) as when it was a pin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms are 100% mycelium and mycelium grows via cell division.&amp;nbsp; A fully mature mushroom has more cells than a pin.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure there's also some swelling going on as the cells engorge with water, but it's certainly not an either/or thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller fruits on a substrate are generally more potent per gram than larger fruits on the same substrate though.&amp;nbsp; That's a fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13558473</next>\n<prev>13558309</prev>\n<first>13557593</first>\n<last>13570648</last>\n<when>1291076146</when>\n<utime>11/30/10 02:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
