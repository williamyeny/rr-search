The mycelium recovers on the grains, but what happens is when you damage the kernels, it leaves an opening for contaminant spores to get on the damaged grains and grow before the mycelium recovers.  As long as you're gentle enough not to fracture the rye or wbs kernels during mixing, you're ok.  Personally, I do it in thin layers when I make straw projects.  Just add a handful of grain, and a few handfuls of straw until the project is made.  This way you do it with no shaking or stirring.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6280617</next>\n<prev>6280559</prev>\n<first>6279230</first>\n<last>6282941</last>\n<when>1163479493</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 06:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
