Casing what?  Casing is simply a top layer applied over a substrate.  It makes no sense to use the word &lt;i&gt;casings&lt;/i&gt;.  It should be removed from people's vocabulary. Primordia form in 99% humidity, and rarely in less.  A casing layer can help to keep humidity at the surface of the substrate at 99%, even though the air in the fruiting chamber might be lower, threfore they allow for more sloppy technique.  However, with less than upper 90's percent humidity, the casing layer dries out fast at the recommended level of air exchanges, defeating the purpose unless you mist heavily a few times daily.  That's why I recommend 99% humidity for all growing, regardless of whether one cases his substrate or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6888753</next>\n<prev>6888554</prev>\n<first>6888479</first>\n<last>6888787</last>\n<when>1178643409</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 07:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
