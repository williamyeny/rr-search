{"key":"post-5136862","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5136862</id>\n<content>I run two coolmist humidifiers inside my greenhouse.  The one nuk1m linked to above is the wrong type though.  You want the coolmist with a spinning impeller, not a filter pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put one coolmist near the top and the second one on a center shelf.  Either get a humidistat or set them up to run for three to five minutes every half hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't drill holes in the coolmist.  Most come with a two year warranty, but you can't return them if they've been modified.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5137073</next>\n<prev>5136745</prev>\n<first>5136353</first>\n<last>5139504</last>\n<when>1136352450</when>\n<utime>01/04/06 07:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
