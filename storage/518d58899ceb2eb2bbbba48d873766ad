I have several that are ten years old and still work great with monthly calibrations.  You must calibrate them for accuracy, because the tiny hair inside stretches with time, just as it stretches and contracts with changes in humidity.  Calibrate monthly.  Get a ten dollar hygrometer at a cigar shop and it will last for years.  99% of the electronic hygrometers are trash above 80%, so avoid them.  The cheap mechanical ones will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, condensation on the walls of a terrarium in NO way is an indication of humidity.  It is only an indication of a temperature differential.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure how to calibrate a hygrometer, do a search under my user name and the words 'calibrate hygrometer', and you'll find the procedure.  I've typed it plenty of times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6064731</next>\n<prev>6063927</prev>\n<first>6063584</first>\n<last>6067046</last>\n<when>1158345169</when>\n<utime>09/15/06 09:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
