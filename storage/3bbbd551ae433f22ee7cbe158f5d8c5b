Bacterial contamination 90% of the time comes from the body of the person performing the inoculation. Use a surgical mask, gloves, fresh shower, dry with fresh towel, wear tight fitting clothes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could always try to isolate the healthy mycelium on agar and use it to make LC's, slants, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't just make shit up when you don't know the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria is not a dangerous contaminant of substrates in the fruiting stage at all.&amp;nbsp; For christ sake, cubes in the wild grow on cow shit, and how many sterile cow pies do you people think are laying around in pastures getting pissed on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to scream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tell people to toss out moldy cakes so they won't spread spores around the grow area, not because the fruits from them are dangerous, which they are not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16382525</next>\n<prev>16382486</prev>\n<first>16382377</first>\n<last>24980370</last>\n<when>1339722939</when>\n<utime>06/15/12 04:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
