It adds texture and helps to keep the mixture from packing down with repeated mistings.  That's why it's often recommended by experienced mycologists for use in a casing layer.  Hydrated lime, or limestone flour is used as a ph buffer.  Gypsum is also added as a source of calcium and sulphur, as well as to prevent ph swings.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be able to put the calcium chips in a coffee grinder to reduce them.  What size are they?  Does the label show the source of the calcium?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5925790</next>\n<prev>5925540</prev>\n<first>5925350</first>\n<last>5925865</last>\n<when>1154549708</when>\n<utime>08/02/06 11:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
