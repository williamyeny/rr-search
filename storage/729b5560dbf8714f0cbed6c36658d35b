The other 99 are not going to germinate.  Stretch that out to a one year old print, and less than one spore out of a thousand is viable, and it declines even more rapidly from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To play the numbers with a very old print, you'll want to do massive spore inoculation, but the problem is that the more mushroom spores you use, the more contaminant spores are going to be along for the ride, and they'll also be competing for the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, fresh prints are always going to give the best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5956705</next>\n<prev>5956517</prev>\n<first>5955631</first>\n<last>5956802</last>\n<when>1155411132</when>\n<utime>08/12/06 10:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
