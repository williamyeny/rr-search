You'll notice nobody with a 'trusted cultivator' tag told you that your 93% is fine for cakes. Performance of cakes is severely impeded if your humidity is less than saturation.&amp;nbsp; Cakes want 99% to 100% humidity with lots of air exchange.&amp;nbsp; Terrariums with bubblers may have been 'state of the art' ten years ago, but left much to be desired, and we've learned a lot since then.&amp;nbsp; Get rid of the standing water and air pumps, and use three to five inches of well drained perlite instead.&amp;nbsp; Either drill holes in your terrarium, or fan it several times per day, and mist as required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to keep your lights on a 12/12 schedule for best results.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you're using fluorescent lights and not regular light bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8997377</next>\n<prev>8997287</prev>\n<first>8992977</first>\n<last>9091200</last>\n<when>1222614781</when>\n<utime>09/28/08 06:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
