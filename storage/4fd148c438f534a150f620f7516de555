You'll find the pf tek in the FAQ which is a link at the top of the page.  You can also see a free video on it over on yahoo at <a href=\"http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=mushroom+cultivation&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://video.search.yahoo.com/se<wbr>arch/video?p=mushroom+cultivation<wbr>&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei<wbr>=UTF-8</a>  You'll need to grow out pf cakes, and THEN you can use those to inoculate the manure after you've pasteurized it.  Please read the pf tek and watch all four parts of the video(in order) so you have a basis for future questions before asking any more.  Thanks.<br />RR"}}
