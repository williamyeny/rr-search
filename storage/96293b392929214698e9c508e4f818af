Just wash it off. There is nothing dangerous about picking and eating mushrooms from a cake or casing that has trichoderma.(green mold)  The danger with some molds is from breathing the spores.  What is dangerous to eat would be any fruits that are contaminated with bacteria.  If your casing smells like sour apples or dirty socks, toss it.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2865304</next>\n<prev>2862645</prev>\n<first>2861007</first>\n<last>2865304</last>\n<when>1089182332</when>\n<utime>07/07/04 09:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
