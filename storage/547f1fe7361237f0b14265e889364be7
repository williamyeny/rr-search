Many substrains are incompatible with each other and never merge.  Other substrains do merge by anastomosis, but the incompatible ones do not.  Bear in mind, a 'strain' is created when two compatible hypahae join and share genetic information.  The OMC definition of a 'strain' where it's named after a region the original was picked from is not mycologically correct.  There is easily as much genetic diversity in a single sporeprint as there is between sporeprints from opposite sides of the planet.  The species is Cubensis, the strain is whatever you end up with, fancy names notwithstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pictures below, both strains were isolated from the same sporeprint, but are clearly incompatible, as seen from the uncolonized line of inhibition between them.  It appears from the picture above, that is likely what's happening with his tray.  The rest of the flush will grow when they're good and ready, whether or not he picks the early bird, which should have matured and been picked by now anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-39/791852198-zone_of_inhibition_001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-39/791852198-thumb_zone_of_inhibition_001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-39/791856189-zone_of_inhibition_002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-39/791856189-thumb_zone_of_inhibition_002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5597860</next>\n<prev>5597106</prev>\n<first>5595078</first>\n<last>5597860</last>\n<when>1146934045</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 07:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
