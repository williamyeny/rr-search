You can get good tyvek at your local home megacenter in the paint department in the form of tyvek coveralls.  You can make a couple hundred filters out of a suit that costs five bucks.  Save the post office stuff for mailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just want your grains double the original dry size, and dry on the outside when you load the jars.  However you do that is fine.  I soak for 4 to 30 hours, then boil for five minutes at a rapid boil, then drain.  The boiling makes the excess moisture steam off the grains as they drain.  It helps to shake the strainer around to toss the grains a bit and make more moisture steam off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old method described in stamets book is to put the water and grain in the jar and PC, but that method results in a lot of cracked kernels because they expand too fast.  Cracked kernels release starches that inhibit colonization and can lead to other problems such as bacterial blooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6661151</next>\n<prev>6660786</prev>\n<first>6660745</first>\n<last>6669641</last>\n<when>1173708455</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
