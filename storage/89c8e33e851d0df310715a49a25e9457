Also that you could block light from getting to the lower parts by covering or painting the case to prevent them from growing there, but the ones on the bottom had basically no light and grew anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has nothing to do with light.&amp;nbsp; The best conditions were between the substrate and container so they pinned there.&amp;nbsp; Dump it out and harvest all those side pins in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19519438</next>\n<prev>19519194</prev>\n<first>19519163</first>\n<last>19519692</last>\n<when>1391521933</when>\n<utime>02/04/14 03:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
