I don't ask because I want to avoid it, I've just never heard about this when growing shrooms before, I know they need light so they know which direction to grow, but I've never heard anything about light cycles.</blockquote><br />Light isn't to tell them which way to grow.&nbsp; Light is a pinning trigger and mycelium uses light for energy.&nbsp; A 12/12 cycle is best. Use lights that are labeled 6500 Kelvin.&nbsp; This is the color spectrum that gives best performance.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />psyclobin cubensis </blockquote><br />The term you're looking for is <i>Psilocybe cubensis</i>.&nbsp; Psilocybe is a four syllable word, pronounced&nbsp; <b>sill</b> as in window sill, <b>ahh</b> as in stick out your tongue and say ahh for the doctor, <b>ci</b> as in cigarette, <b>bee</b> as in honey bee.&nbsp; Accent is on the second syllable.&nbsp; Sill-ahh'-ci-bee.<br />RR"}}
