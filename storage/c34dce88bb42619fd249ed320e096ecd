If there's any healthy mycelium, transfer a tiny piece of that from the leading edge of growth.  A few days later, transfer again before any molds have had a chance to show up.  Repeat a few times and you'll have a clean culture, provided there is any mushroom mycelium on the plate.  It should also go with out saying to use a glovebox.  Never open a contaminated petri dish in front of a flow hood.<br />RR"}}
