That's why they must be maintained under perfectly sterile conditions until fully colonized or they will get contaminated.  <br />Edible growers put up to 20% wheat or rice bran into their sawdust/chip substrates in addition to inoculating with grains.  When you fruit a manure or other bulk substrate, the grains/brf you used for spawn is a major supplier of nutrients to the mycelium.  You'll get nowhere trying to inoculate a bulk substrate with liquid culture.  You need the mass of the colonized grains.<br />RR"}}
