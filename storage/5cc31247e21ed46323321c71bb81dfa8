Those pictures are actually Stamet's from an early edition of TMC, and they're not cubensis.  You have to be careful intrepreting a picture of one species/genus of mycelium and applying it to another.  One of those pics represents stroma.  It's the closest to what overlay actually looks like with cubensis.  A bit of rhizomorphic mycelium on the surface is ok. It's what produces primordia. Patch if you want to, but if you have primordia showing, don't.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6222856</next>\n<prev>6222847</prev>\n<first>6222154</first>\n<last>6222856</last>\n<when>1162122762</when>\n<utime>10/29/06 01:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
