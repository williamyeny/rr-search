Typical LEDs (the little guys from radioshack) have a voltage drop of .7v across the leads. Anyway without a current limiting resistor, regardless of the voltage, the LEDs will draw as much current as the source can supply (V=IR, R approaches 0). I guarantee this will blow your bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, series enough that the voltage drop equals the supply voltage.&amp;nbsp; Assuming a .7 drop per LED, 17 in series would drop 12 volts. Zener diodes come to mind for those of us geek enough to know how to use them as regulators. However, I would imagine those without electrical skills are going to buy pre-made strings that come with a power supply ready to plug in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9520422</next>\n<prev>9519926</prev>\n<first>9515567</first>\n<last>14282556</last>\n<when>1230689067</when>\n<utime>12/31/08 04:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
