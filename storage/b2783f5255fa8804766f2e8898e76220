They are not dependent on light at all to grow. Some say it is a secondary pinning trigger but even as such an hour a day is enough in that sense. You arent gaining anything IMO by using a light cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total complete disinformation.&amp;nbsp; Nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Tens of thousands of grows by experienced professionals prove otherwise.&amp;nbsp; If you're satisfied with skinny mushrooms with tiny caps and 25% of the weight they could attain with proper lighting, then by all means go for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, mushrooms primarily grow during the dark cycle, so using 18/6 will result in lower performance.&amp;nbsp; It's not a deal killer, but also is not the best you can do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>14847082</prev>\n<first>14846775</first>\n<last>14847295</last>\n<when>1312024461</when>\n<utime>07/30/11 02:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
