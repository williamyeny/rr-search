I am interested in trying to use the peroxide tek but I only have spores to work with. i mean, if bleach is used, can you skip all the sterilizing and pressure cooking? anything to simplify the process would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original poster disappeared, never to be heard from again, three months after making this thread.&amp;nbsp; Peroxide and/or bleach are not substitutes for pressure cooking.&amp;nbsp; Neither bleach nor peroxide will kill all bacterial endospores.&amp;nbsp; Soaking in bleach before pressure cooking would be like wearing a parachute in your car.&amp;nbsp; It would serve no purpose.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thread was started when that silly 'peroxide tek' was floating around, with some dude trying to charge $20 or more for a few pages printed off his computer showing how to use peroxide rather than sterilizing.&amp;nbsp; It's horrible.&amp;nbsp; I don't know of one single grower who tried it(including myself) who still thinks it's a viable technique.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11330830</next>\n<prev>11330306</prev>\n<first>4967874</first>\n<last>11338806</last>\n<when>1256659475</when>\n<utime>10/27/09 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
