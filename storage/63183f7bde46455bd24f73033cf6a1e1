That is not proper mycological technique, and I've been preaching that to whomever will listen since this whole silly LC fad started last year.  Your contaminated LC contaminated the rest of your project right down to the bulk substrate, ruining all your hard work.  When you get green mold before first flush, it means the spawn itself was contaminated, and you can't cut it out because the mold mycelium is white, just like mushroom mycelium, and it permeates the whole substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LC should not be made except with a proved, fruiting strain of clean mycelium, or you're just playing russian roulette with your time and money.  Next time, use your spores to inject some cakes or grains, or better yet, agar. Then use those to spawn your bulk.  Cut the LC out of the picture completely.  I've explained many times on this board how to make mycelium syringes from a jar of colonized grains, and it's a hundred times faster and more secure than injecting an unproved syringe into a jar of sugar water and hoping for the best.  Good luck to you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6576441</next>\n<prev>6574330</prev>\n<first>6574152</first>\n<last>6576441</last>\n<when>1171652401</when>\n<utime>02/16/07 09:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
