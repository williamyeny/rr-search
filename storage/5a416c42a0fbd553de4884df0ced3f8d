{"key":"post-7550073","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7550073</id>\n<content>The need to soak is not overstated.  Some batches of grains have many more endospores than others.  It also matters the region the grains were grown in.  Many factors are involved, but soaking makes sure they're taken care of.  If you have a grain supply that works fine without a soak, then don't bother soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason for soaking first is to slowly hydrate the grains so they don't burst.  Burst kernels release starch and other goo that will slow down colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7550231</next>\n<prev>7550056</prev>\n<first>7542732</first>\n<last>7558224</last>\n<when>1193143981</when>\n<utime>10/23/07 03:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
