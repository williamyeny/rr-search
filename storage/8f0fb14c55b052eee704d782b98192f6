However, you can spawn your cakes, spent substrates, contaminated substrates, and even grain spawn into your garden and it will grow.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent manure decomposer, so it will help to break down the manure and compost in your garden and make it available to the plants.&amp;nbsp; Cubes will also trap and kill root knot nematodes if you have problems with those.&amp;nbsp; Be careful using grain spawn in your garden if you have problems with squirrels or rabbits in your area because they'll dig up the grains to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulch the areas with a few inches of straw and the mushrooms will fruit up through it when they're ready.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11751594</next>\n<prev>11751587</prev>\n<first>11751502</first>\n<last>11759926</last>\n<when>1262442581</when>\n<utime>01/02/10 04:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
