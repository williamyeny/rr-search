Following sterile procedure is not wasting time.&nbsp; Wiping a needle with alcohol does little to kill mold spores, and <i>nothing to kill bacteria</i> on the <b>inside</b> of the needle.&nbsp; Experienced growers rarely use syringes, but when they do, they always flame sterilize to ensure success."}}
