It recently happened with a bunch of shiitake when I had to do sterile work a few times in the room my greenhouse is in.  I sprayed the air with oust several times over a couple of weeks, and got mutants like that.   After I stopped using oust in the room with the mini greenhouse, fruits that appeared were normal.  I have no guarantee it was the oust, but it's the prime suspect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6183365</next>\n<prev>6171714</prev>\n<first>6169881</first>\n<last>6215646</last>\n<when>1160938003</when>\n<utime>10/15/06 09:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
