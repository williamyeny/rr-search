It doesn't matter how hot your stove is or how rapidly the water is boiling, it will be at 212F/100C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you're calling a 'casing' is not a casing at all but an uncased bulk substrate.  Forget the verm on bottom.  Layer colonized spawn in alternating layers with your pasteurized horse manure, 1/2&quot; per layer.  Don't go over 3&quot; total thickness.  2&quot; is probably better.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 'casing' is a non-nutritious top layer that is applied over the fully colonized horse manure in order to supply moisture to the substrate below and to provide an environment suitable for pinning.  a casing layer is optional with cubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to pick up a pressue cooker.  Popcorn and other grains need to be pressure cooked to achieve any degree of success on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7005770</next>\n<prev>7005727</prev>\n<first>7005245</first>\n<last>7005841</last>\n<when>1180933349</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 08:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
