It's a great learning tool, but nobody runs a commercial mushroom farm using 1/2 pint cakes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brf/pf tek is great for new growers to learn the ropes and it's great for testing isolated strains.&amp;nbsp; For people to slam the easiest and fastest way to get mushrooms is just plain dumb.&amp;nbsp; That's like saying a three year old kid shouldn't ever get a tricycle for his birthday because a Harley Davidson will get him where he wants to go much faster.&amp;nbsp; People need to realize than any hobby is a learning experience.&amp;nbsp; You don't slam your kindergarten teacher for teaching you the ABCs, simply because you can now read 'War and Peace'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12597317</next>\n<prev>12597010</prev>\n<first>8272671</first>\n<last>12619015</last>\n<when>1274371451</when>\n<utime>05/20/10 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
