They played with rattlers as babies, so they can understand that sound. In other words, walmart has to dumb down the instructions.&amp;nbsp; Not only that, the unit was designed for canning.&amp;nbsp; We're 'misusing' it as a sterilizing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn the stove down so there's no rocking once pressure is reached and the weight has jiggled a few times.&amp;nbsp; If this means it runs at 14 psi to keep things quiet, so be it.&amp;nbsp; Usually a small hiss will escape before the weight actually rattles.&amp;nbsp; If you can find this sweet spot, great.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, just run at 13 to 14 psi.&amp;nbsp; This prevents your jars from drying out or your agar from boiling over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to let the PC vent steam for five to ten minutes at the start of the cycle before you close the valve or place the weight in place.&amp;nbsp; This is important to bleed all the air out of the unit and replace it with steam.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17587136</next>\n<prev>17586789</prev>\n<first>17586687</first>\n<last>17587136</last>\n<when>1358821480</when>\n<utime>01/22/13 04:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
