Trich also loves wet surfaces, uncolonized surfaces, and exposed grain on the surface, whether or not they are colonized already with mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't an either/or scenario.&amp;nbsp; You want fresh air, AND moving air.&amp;nbsp; Both will help to fight molds and promote mushroom growth.&amp;nbsp; The main reason we air out our grow areas is to stimulate pinning and fruit development, which can't happen in CO2 laden air.&amp;nbsp; The fighting molds aspect is a side-benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium can tolerate a high CO2 level.&amp;nbsp; However, it doesn't stimulate it to pin.&amp;nbsp; For pinning you want a low CO2 level, not more than twice ambient.&amp;nbsp; If there's a dozen or more substrates in a closed up closet, the CO2 level will go to 5,000 ppm within a few hours, even if there is a fan going.&amp;nbsp; The air is still stale, just moving.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12450806</next>\n<prev>12450502</prev>\n<first>12449786</first>\n<last>12451526</last>\n<when>1272153484</when>\n<utime>04/25/10 02:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
