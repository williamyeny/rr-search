If you can maintain upper 90's humidity, then the more holes the better.  Air exchange is the key to contaminant avoidance and good pinsets.  However, if you over do it  on the holes, performance will suffer if you can't keep up with good humidity.  If you're unable to maintain humidity with all your holes, begin taping them up until you can maintain 95%.  That will be the sweet spot.<br />Many people also don't realize that if you double the diameter of a hole, you increase its area by four times.  That means a 1/4\" hole is four times as large as a 1/8\" hole, and a 1/2\" hole is four times as large as a 1/4\" hole.   You can dry out your terrarium in a hurry if you have too much.<br />With this system, it also helps to run a humidifier in the room your terrarium is located, if you live in a dry or air conditioned climate.  If your ambient humidity is in the 50% range, your terrarium will do much better than if it's in the 10% range.<br />RR"}}
