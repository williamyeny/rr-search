Noobs also obsess over humidity for some reason when fresh air and light are far more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is not the purpose of this site, nor has science developed transducers which will operate in the conditions we require.&amp;nbsp; Lazy people always fail at this because you quite frankly need to be checking your crop several times daily to remove moldy substrates and do other chores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>18948489</prev>\n<first>18946960</first>\n<last>18948541</last>\n<when>1381240260</when>\n<utime>10/08/13 04:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
