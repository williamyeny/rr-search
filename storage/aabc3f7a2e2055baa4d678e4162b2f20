I prefer the impeller type cool mists for both though, because those things with a wicking type 'filter' in them get all moldy and nasty every couple of weeks.  Those filters at $10 a pop will waste your money.  A vicks 400, 420, or similar will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6711821</next>\n<prev>6710940</prev>\n<first>6705952</first>\n<last>6711821</last>\n<when>1174892109</when>\n<utime>03/26/07 09:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
