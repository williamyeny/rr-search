Don't dilute it.  Keep trays out of an incubator during casing run.  Use room temperature.  High temperatures encourage cobweb and other molds over mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've made many casing layers without any heat treatment at all.  It doesn't make them 'much' more susceptible to molds. In fact, shaggy manes sometimes need two months after casing is applied before they pin, and non-pasteurization is the only way to get a casing layer to last that long without molding, because it preserves the beneficial bacteria that keeps the casing layer 'alive'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb comes from lack of air exchange.  At least once or twice during casing run you need to take a peek.  If cobweb is forming, hit it with peroxide.  You need to saturate the entire casing layer because Dactylium spreads by mycelial fragments that break off and travel through the air to a new spot where they take hold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6249653</next>\n<prev>6249391</prev>\n<first>6247726</first>\n<last>6283684</last>\n<when>1162746290</when>\n<utime>11/05/06 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
