In addition, there is nothing sterile about gloveboxes.  They're a place to do inoculations in still air.  You sterilize your substrates with steam or pressure cooking, and then do your inoculations in a clean(soap and water) glovebox.  Needles and scalpels should get flame sterilized until red hot before use, and in between uses.  Don't use UV.<br />RR"}}
