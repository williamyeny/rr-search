Blue or blue spectrum isn't necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lights should be applied for at least several hours per day.  With some strains/species, they won't grow well at all with less than very bright light.  I don't subscribe to the five minutes is plenty routine, even for cubes.  Consistent, good results require more light than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've often said 'total darkness' is overrated, but the importance of light in conjunction with the other pinning triggers cannot be underestimated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6036190</next>\n<prev>6034856</prev>\n<first>6034562</first>\n<last>6036190</last>\n<when>1157570141</when>\n<utime>09/06/06 10:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
