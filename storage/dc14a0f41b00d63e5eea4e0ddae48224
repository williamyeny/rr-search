I've cloned wild mushrooms before by dipping in 10% bleach for up to fifteen minutes to kill bacteria before placing on agar.  The bacteria is killed, but not the mushroom OR mold mycelium that might be along for the ride.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happens a lot.  What you did was bleach the green spores white, making you think the trich was dead.  The trich mycelium is still there, and still alive and well as agar said.  There is no cure for trichoderma in a casing layer or bulk substrate.  The mycelium is white and mixed with the mushroom mycelium.  you can't even see it to cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On wood based substrates, a touch of surface trich that develops after a flush or two can easily be killed off with a salt paste.  This doesn't work with substrates such as manure or straw, etc., that are completly permeated with the mold.
