The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form between it and the rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate is incorporated into the forespore during this time. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Doc_T said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bacterial endospore is not a spore or seed, it's an encrusted form of a bacterium. . . .The endospore forms when the live bacterium encounters dry conditions . . .A bacterium becomes an endospore, it does not produce them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all make mistakes, but we're here to learn.&amp;nbsp; It's not an attack on you, rather on the incorrect information posted as fact.&amp;nbsp; It would be less vitriolic to ask about that which you don't understand, rather than to attack Paul and I for what we've personally observed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to see inside an endospore with a light microscope, but the endospore itself can be easily seen and observed as it forms. They are produced by the cell, not a change of state which will simply revert back to '&lt;i&gt;the form it had before, a live active bacterium and gets on with business.'&lt;/i&gt;. If I had more time, I'd set up my video camera equipped microscope and film it.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps in the future. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this clears up any misunderstanding.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14068107</next>\n<prev>14055950</prev>\n<first>14053216</first>\n<last>14068107</last>\n<when>1299119422</when>\n<utime>03/03/11 04:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
