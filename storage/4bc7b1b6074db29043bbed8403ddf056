The reason is that pins are more potent by weight than larger mushrooms.  It's unrelated to them aborting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove any that the caps have turned black, as they're aborts.  Once dry, they're safe to eat because drying kills off the live bacteria.  There are two phenomena that are often called 'split caps'.  One is from growing fast and is normal.  The other is more correctly called 'cracked' caps and is related to low humidity.  Either are usually fine to eat.  Post a picture if you want a better diagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6680046</next>\n<prev>6679651</prev>\n<first>6679520</first>\n<last>6680046</last>\n<when>1174150224</when>\n<utime>03/17/07 07:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
