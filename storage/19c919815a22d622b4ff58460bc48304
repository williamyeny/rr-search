It colonizes so slow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaking the bag, carefully work all the substrate out of the folds.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, when you strip the bags off, you rip out part of the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're fruiting in the bag, the pre-sealable bags are OK to use, but otherwise don't use them.&amp;nbsp; The filters allow too much gasses to pass, and this leads to premature pinning in the bag.&amp;nbsp; This is especially a problem with shiitake.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12690002</prev>\n<first>12687071</first>\n<last>12690019</last>\n<when>1275740570</when>\n<utime>06/05/10 03:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
