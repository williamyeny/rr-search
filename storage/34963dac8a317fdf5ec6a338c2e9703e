Weighted-gauge pressure canners exhaust tiny&lt;br /&gt;amounts of air and steam each time the gauge rocks or&lt;br /&gt;jiggles during processing. They control pressure pre-&lt;br /&gt;cisely and need neither constant watching nor checking&lt;br /&gt;for accuracy during processing. The sound of the weight&lt;br /&gt;rocking or jiggling indicates that the canner is maintain-&lt;br /&gt;ing the recommended pressure.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 'jiggling weight' is put there for the retarded so they don't have to watch a gauge, and it also protects them from themselves, because the weight is supposed to release steam to prevent the unit from exploding. They also come with a warning about the maximum BTU the burner can be because too much fire under the PC will prevent the jiggler from releasing enough.&amp;nbsp; The best sterilizers seal up tight and no steam escapes after pressure is reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, every time the weight jiggles, when steam is released from the water within, it's also released from the substrate jars, thus drying them out.&amp;nbsp; There's a huge difference between pressure cooking vegetables and sterilizing grains.&amp;nbsp; You don't use the instructions of the former for the latter.&amp;nbsp; This is why we see so many fails when people buy those cheap ass chinese pressure cookers at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14081859</next>\n<prev>14080043</prev>\n<first>14072526</first>\n<last>14086417</last>\n<when>1299512760</when>\n<utime>03/07/11 05:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
