It happened when I accidentally knocked over my bottle of alcohol on the table I was working on, when there was a torch lit.  The full, burning bottle of alcohol got knocked off the table, where it landed in the carpet and immediately got that started burning, which caught the curtains on fire too.  I had to completely empty our linen closet to get enough sheets and blankets to smother the fire out, which ruined everything.  However, I was about 30 seconds away from calling 911 and letting events take their course.<br />After that adventure, I purchased a large fire extinguisher and always keep it near my work area.  I also got some chemical bottles with squeeze spouts to keep the alcohol in.  Always keep the alcohol on the opposite side of the table from where your flame is.<br />RR"}}
