Do a dunk and roll, but roll in dry verm when the cake is dripping wet.  Don't dry it off first as suggested above.  The water is what makes the verm stick. You can just wait until the others have been ready for a week if you wanted to birth all the cakes at once.  It's up to you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7804525</next>\n<prev>7804503</prev>\n<first>7804428</first>\n<last>7804684</last>\n<when>1198796653</when>\n<utime>12/28/07 01:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
