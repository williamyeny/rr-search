(21X44)/144=6.4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want 100 to 125 linear feet per minute flowing out from the filter, therefore in a perfect world with no resistance, you'd want a fan that could deliver 640 cfm(cubic feet per minute) at minimum and 800 cfm at the top end.  I always just wing it and add around ten percent or so to make up for ineffeciency and friction, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at Grainger.com and find a squirrel cage blower that will deliver that kind of flow @ 1&quot; static pressure.  A lot of motors rating only goes up to .8 wc, but consider that the same as 1&quot; for our purposes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8458702</next>\n<prev>8456746</prev>\n<first>8450392</first>\n<last>8531972</last>\n<when>1212027865</when>\n<utime>05/29/08 05:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
