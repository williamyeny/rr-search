The very rapid cooldown from 250F to 212F  while the grains or other substrate inside of the jars is still 250F, will cause many jars to break.  Furthermore, water at 250F must be under pressure to exist in the liquid state.(please don't repeat that distilled water in a microwave story)  Therefore, when you release pressure, you also release moisture from the substrate.  That is a fact of physics.  It can be made up for by adding more water to begin with, but now you're forced to figure out how much is going to be lost.  That is beyond the reach of the new folks trying to learn so many other facets of the hobby.  It's far better to tell them to NOT release pressure early to remove one more variable from the equation.<br />You guys need to quit jerking with each other's ratings over these pissing matches.  It looks just as bad to give a zero rating as it does to receive one.  When you get calmed down, go back and fix/edit them please.  Thanks.<br />RR"}}
