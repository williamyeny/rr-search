Oysters will also grow on wood, although they'll fruit faster on straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GT, EQ, and Amazon are all the same species, but those are cubensis, which are dung and straw lovers, not wood.

Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5849875</prev>\n<first>5849875</first>\n<last>5849996</last>\n<when>1152708810</when>\n<utime>07/12/06 03:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
