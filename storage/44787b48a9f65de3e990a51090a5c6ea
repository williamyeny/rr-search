Since your inoculated jars didn't contaminate, that's a good sign too.  You can let the syringe stand vertical for a few minutes so those spores can sink to near the needle, then you can inject them.  If that works, it shows it was a too light syringe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7861400</next>\n<prev>7861263</prev>\n<first>7861227</first>\n<last>7863006</last>\n<when>1200020240</when>\n<utime>01/11/08 04:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
