PF cakes are saturated with water which is an excellent heat conductor.  If the jar is cool to the touch, the middle will be cool also.  A cup of coffee doesn't get cold on the outside, but still hot in the center.  Please think before posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To repeat, if the jars are cool or gently warm when you touch them to the sensitive skin on your wrist or the back of your hand, they are cool enough to inoculate.  Any temp below about 100F is fine for inoculation.  It's nice to wait overnight if you're not in a hurry, but it's not necessary.  The center of the jars are NOT hot after the outside has cooled.  It's only a 1/2 pint jar for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7130183</next>\n<prev>7128066</prev>\n<first>7125906</first>\n<last>7172147</last>\n<when>1183573858</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 09:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
