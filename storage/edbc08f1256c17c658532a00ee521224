The steam will not stay there unless it's kept under pressure, and foil sure as hell won't do that.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest searching some of these terms or look at the &lt;b&gt;Similar Threads&lt;/b&gt; links below to find a few of the thousands of times your very idea has been tried before with 100% failure by people who don't understand the engineering behind why steam under pressure is warmer than 212F/100C.&amp;nbsp; Those of us who have been doing this for decades don't use pressure vessels for sterilization because someone told us to.&amp;nbsp; We use them because it's the only way that works for indoor sterile culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to grow in an unsterile environment, grow outdoors.&amp;nbsp; There, nature is in balance and the mushroom mycelium will hold it's own.&amp;nbsp; Indoors, we use sterile procedure to get the most bang for the buck.&amp;nbsp; We want to get a pound of mushrooms from a small substrate, not a pound of mushrooms from a 100 acre pasture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11076619</next>\n<prev>11076519</prev>\n<first>11064931</first>\n<last>11079308</last>\n<when>1253214024</when>\n<utime>09/17/09 10:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
