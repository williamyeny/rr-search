I use 'normal' room temperature, which is defined variously as being between 72F and 76F.   The best compromise between stimulating mushroom mycelium and NOT stimulating molds and bacteria seems to be 75F to 81F.  Growth falls off rapidly at any temp above 83F, so avoid high temps, as they also favor thermophilic molds.<br />RR"}}
