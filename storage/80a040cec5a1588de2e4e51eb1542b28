Just put a cake or casing in a tub and let the sink faucet fill it up until it starts to run over. Allow the water to overflow and run down the drain slowly overnight.  The running water prevents bacterial growth during the dunk.  If using still water for the dunk, I'd recommend using 1/2 teaspoon of bleach per gallon of dunk water.  Personally, I've never felt a need to use either distilled or spring water for dunking.  If your local water supply is polluted however, it might make a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5313957</prev>\n<first>5313913</first>\n<last>5314069</last>\n<when>1140310015</when>\n<utime>02/19/06 02:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
