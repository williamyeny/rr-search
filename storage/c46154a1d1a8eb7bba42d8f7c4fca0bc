Just lay them out on paper towels or cardboard in the open, with a fan blowing on them.  They'll be dry in 24 to 36 hours, then put on desiccant to get the last of the moisture out.  Any mushroom that has been picked a week ago and is still wet is a case of food poisoning waiting to happen.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6161377</prev>\n<first>5455843</first>\n<last>6161465</last>\n<when>1160667987</when>\n<utime>10/12/06 06:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
