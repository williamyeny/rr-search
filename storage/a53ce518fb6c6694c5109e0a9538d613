And they're huge, and I think that is probably way too much overkill for the fruiting stage &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True.&amp;nbsp; A 27 watt or so will be fine, as long as you keep it close to the terrarium-no more than a few inches.&amp;nbsp; The amount of light decreases by the square of the distance, so a 10 watt lamp placed 3 inches away will will give roughly the same amount of light intensity as a 100 watt lamp placed ten inches away. (not trying to be exact with the math, just making a point)&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>16322857</prev>\n<first>16322540</first>\n<last>16323081</last>\n<when>1338687375</when>\n<utime>06/03/12 04:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
