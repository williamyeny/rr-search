{"key":"post-7689871","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7689871</id>\n<content>For quite some time now, I've advised against the use of aluminum trays for cultivation of mushrooms due to the fact that certain species of mycelium produce metabolites that actually dissolve holes into the trays, usually prior to first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as I could research, nobody had ever sent off a mushroom to a lab for testing after growing from an aluminum tray.  Below is a tray that was used to hold a shiitake substrate.  When the project fruited, I sent a mushroom to the lab for analysis.  The results are next to the picture of the tray below.  It appears that the aluminum content of the mushroom was very low, so apparently the metal is not conducted into the fruits.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other reasons not to use aluminum trays, such as the increased risk of bottom pinning due to the air exchange down there once the holes are created.  It also reflects light down the sides of the tray.  However, it does not appear that the aluminum is transferred to the fruit, even though the metabolites dissolve it.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-45/456009399-Aluminum_shiitake_tray.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-45/456009399-thumb_Aluminum_shiitake_tray.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-48/627094849-Metals-LE-251007LE020_blocked.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-48/627094849-thumb_Metals-LE-251007LE020_blocked.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7689901</next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>7689871</first>\n<last>19689041</last>\n<when>1196272181</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 07:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
