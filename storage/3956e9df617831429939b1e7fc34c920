I've often had a single colonizing bag or jar that got trich, and if not noticed in time, it spreads to other nearby jars and/or bags.  The filters will stop 99.9% or more of the spores, but .1% of a few billion is a lot of spores that still escape or find their way into another container.<br />I'd toss it right now.  It won't recover unless you bury it into a manure or coir bed outdoors. <br />RR"}}
