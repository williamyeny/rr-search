If you want to test your strains, learn agar work in petri dishes.  It's not that hard and I made a video that makes it simple to learn.  You can easily isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminants on agar.  When you make an LC out of spores, it's like playing Russian roulette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you prove your isolates on agar, simply place wedges into grain jars and you can expand a single jar into an 18 wheeler load of jars in six to eight weeks.  You'll never get performance like that from the spores to lc route.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7165753</next>\n<prev>7165732</prev>\n<first>7165345</first>\n<last>7165757</last>\n<when>1184261901</when>\n<utime>07/12/07 08:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
