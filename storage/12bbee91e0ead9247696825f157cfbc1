I still prefer jars for spawn generation, and bags for sawdust/woodchips.  If you use spawn bags for grains, be sure to make the grains a bit drier than you would make them for use in jars.  The bigger the quantity of grains, the drier they should be prepared or they will stall out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7165419</prev>\n<first>7165281</first>\n<last>7165802</last>\n<when>1184262727</when>\n<utime>07/12/07 08:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
