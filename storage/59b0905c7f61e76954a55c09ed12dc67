If the doctor said 'viral', I'd go with his medical degree over your own paranoia.  Please don't spread nonesense here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the jar was full of mold spores, especially black ones, I've suggested for many years to either toss out or PC before opening, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7964090</prev>\n<first>7963007</first>\n<last>7964104</last>\n<when>1201884582</when>\n<utime>02/01/08 06:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
