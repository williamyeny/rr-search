If so, leave it alone, there's nothing wrong.  If you get green molds, take it outside and put it in the shade until you pick the fruits, then bury it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I meant above about pinning early in the presence of contaminants is when you see pinning in a jar prior to full colonization.  It's because the mycelium ran up against the contaminant and said, &quot;oh heck, this stuff might kick my butt.  I better reproduce by dropping some spores so I'll survive&quot;.  That's why they pin.  It's not because you had the light on when you checked the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5941303</next>\n<prev>5941025</prev>\n<first>5940197</first>\n<last>24905092</last>\n<when>1154989564</when>\n<utime>08/08/06 01:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
