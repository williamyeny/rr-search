Garden lime is intended to break down over several months during the outdoor growing season and will be useless during the three to four week life of a casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use hydrated lime at the rate of 5% by volume of the amount of peat in the casing.  In other words, for 20 pints of peat, use 1 pint of hydrated lime.  Don't count the vermiculite when figuring how much lime to use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5104663</next>\n<prev>5102589</prev>\n<first>5101930</first>\n<last>7838199</last>\n<when>1135482041</when>\n<utime>12/25/05 05:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
