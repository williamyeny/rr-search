The only things I had to change were the size of my jars and the holes in my FC thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that a 1/8&quot; hole is only 25% of the area of a 1/4&quot; hole, there would need to be at least four times as many to get the same level of fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; However, I experimented with using four times as many small holes, and fresh air and humidity always suffered.&amp;nbsp; Use 1/4&quot; holes.&amp;nbsp; It might mean a trip to the hardware store is in order because you still need a clear tub too.&amp;nbsp; Don't use that green one, or cut a hole in the top.&amp;nbsp; More light will enter from the sides anyway, not directly overhead.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14472394</next>\n<prev>14471586</prev>\n<first>14468486</first>\n<last>14523253</last>\n<when>1305723090</when>\n<utime>05/18/11 03:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
