Leaving the foil on after sterilization will do the complete opposite of that, it'll keep the moisture out. Micropore tape is pretty much unnecessary, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three wrongs don't make a right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use lids rubber side up&amp;nbsp; because they're easier to get off.&amp;nbsp; It's somewhat strange to be concerned about the seal of a lid with four open holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove foil after sterilization.&amp;nbsp; Leaving it in place causes the verm filter to become damp with moisture from the rice flour/verm below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micropore tape has saved many grows.&amp;nbsp; I have a nice sterile lab so don't need it, but most guys here don't and as any hot surface cools, it contracts which draws in air.&amp;nbsp; Anything which gives an extra layer of protection during cool-down is desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster, order spores from a reputable source.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16467871</next>\n<prev>16467744</prev>\n<first>16465723</first>\n<last>16468165</last>\n<when>1341199329</when>\n<utime>07/02/12 06:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
