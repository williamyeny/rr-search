Liquid culture would happen faster. I&lt;br /&gt;also feel that most people, in the beginning, use multi spore inoculations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is your input on these matters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agar wedges to brown rice flour cakes?&lt;br /&gt;How do you inoculate brown rice flour/rice bran cakes with agar wedges?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember the last time I grew from spores.&amp;nbsp; It's been a long time though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use agar wedges, and when I use BRF cakes to test isolated strains, I use tyvek or synthetic filter disks, and skip the verm layer.&amp;nbsp; I inoculate in front of a laminar flow hood by lifting the filter and lid up and drop the agar wedge right on top of the brf, and then replace the lid.&amp;nbsp; No shaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a proved strain on agar ensures you're not inoculating with a contaminated syringe.&amp;nbsp; If you're using spore syringes, be sure to spread each syringe out to at least one of each sample in your test.&amp;nbsp; In other words, don't do all the course verm jars with one syringe, fine verm jars with another, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll probably find somewhat slower colonization with the rice bran vs BRF.&amp;nbsp; The reason is the more nutritious a substrate is, the less the mycelium has to reach out to find food.&amp;nbsp; They'll make up for any slow colonization at fruiting time though. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12782742</next>\n<prev>12778914</prev>\n<first>12771785</first>\n<last>16097658</last>\n<when>1277151564</when>\n<utime>06/21/10 11:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
