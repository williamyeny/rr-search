It's not important however to adjust pH with coir when it's used as a substrate.  If you use coir as a casing mix, you need to adjust the pH into the 8 to 8.5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use 5% to 10% gypsum by volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that I don't recommend using blood meal in substrates any more.  My experments showed it did absolutely no good unless it was added to a compost pile, and actually composted into the substrate material.  Kelp is good though.  Mushrooms love seaweed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7039767</next>\n<prev>7039591</prev>\n<first>7038894</first>\n<last>7039909</last>\n<when>1181705126</when>\n<utime>06/13/07 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
