{"key":"post-7559427","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7559427</id>\n<content>Perlite is not hydrophilic, although it &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be treated to have &lt;i&gt;hydrophilic type&lt;/i&gt; properties.  In addition, perlite that has been well rinsed, and then drained before placing in a terrarium 5&quot; deep, will keep it's moisture and provide humidity for well over a month.  This is long enough for a crop cycle.  Between crops, the perlite can be removed and the process repeated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't want cotton or any other organic material in your terrarium because they'd grow mold.  You also don't want standing water.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7560158</next>\n<prev>7559390</prev>\n<first>7559390</first>\n<last>7560158</last>\n<when>1193343513</when>\n<utime>10/25/07 11:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
