If you want more potent fruits, pick them as large pins before the veil begins to tear. I keep seeing pictures of large, spore covered fruits posted here, and then they complain about low potency. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8819292</next>\n<prev>8819199</prev>\n<first>8812977</first>\n<last>8821230</last>\n<when>1219588543</when>\n<utime>08/24/08 05:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
