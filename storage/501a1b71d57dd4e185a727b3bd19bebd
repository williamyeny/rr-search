By trying to push the air, you are attempting to build static pressure, and blade fans simply stink at building static pressure.  That's why hvac units and flowhoods always use squirrel cage fans.<br />The still air/posi pressure debate centers on the amount of turbulence created by the fan.  Any contaminants in the box, and there will be contaminants, will be blown about by the fan, giving them a greater chance of landing in your jars or petri dishes than they would otherwise have in a still air box.  Personally, I prefer a flow hood(who wouldn't?) but my glovebox is still air.<br />RR"}}
