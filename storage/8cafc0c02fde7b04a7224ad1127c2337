FAE and high RH is what makes shroomies nice and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mycelium uses light in the production of energy, thus brighter light is far better than dim light and we don't use light to tell the mushrooms which direction to grow.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grow towards the light because they're using the energy from light to produce ATP within the cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster, run your lights during the day if necessary.&amp;nbsp; If your window is nice and bright, it should be good enough without artificial light.&amp;nbsp; As said above, most growth occurs during the dark period, so keep your mushroom projects on a normal day/night routine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12260944</next>\n<prev>12260402</prev>\n<first>12259401</first>\n<last>12260944</last>\n<when>1269439816</when>\n<utime>03/24/10 05:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
