Just let the tray fill up and overflow and run down the drain.  The gently running water will prevent bacteria buildup during the dunk, as well as wash mold spores off and down the drain.  Let them sit under slowly running water for five or six hours, then drain well and return to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6035394</next>\n<prev>6035304</prev>\n<first>6035304</first>\n<last>6036621</last>\n<when>1157577663</when>\n<utime>09/07/06 12:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
