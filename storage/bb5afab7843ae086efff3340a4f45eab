The idea with pasteurization is to preserve the beneficial bacteria while killing off the mold spores.  Heat does this perfectly.  I've used both bleach and lime pasteurization in the past, but always come back to simple heat, with hydrated lime added.  The Ph of the hydrated lime knocks back the bacteria temporarily so that the mycelium can colonize, but otherwise leaves it unharmed.  Pinsets seem to be better with heat/lime than with bleach. Both methods will prevent green molds long enough to get the substrate colonized. This has been my experience anyway.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6367512</prev>\n<first>6366877</first>\n<last>6367740</last>\n<when>1166066645</when>\n<utime>12/14/06 05:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
