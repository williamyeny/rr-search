Gypsum is calcium sulphate and it's available at every garden center worthy of being in business.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum provides essential nutrients to the mycelium, and also prevents pH swings.  As mycelium colonizes a substrate or casing layer, it naturally makes the medium become more acidic, thus more favorable for mold development.  Gypsum prevents the swing and helps to hold the pH stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use gypsum at ten percent of the amount of the bulk substrate, not at 11.1%, which is what it would be if you did 80% coir, ten percent gypsum and ten percent coffee.  In other words, mix up your bulk substrate.  Mix the coffee, manure, coir, worm castings, etc., in whatever ratio toots your whistle.   Then, for every ten units of substrate, use one unit of gypsum.  You can use less gypsum, but I wouldn't go over ten percent.  Many commercial growers use between five and ten percent.  For five percent gypsum, use one unit of gypsum for each 20 units of substrate.  Mix all the dry ingredients together first, and then add moisture to field capacity.  Pasteurize for 60 to 90 minutes at 140F-160F.  By that, I mean a thermometer stuck into the center of the substrate needs to sit in the 140F to 160F(60C to 70C) range for one full hour after reaching that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add it to casing mixes also at 10% of the peat.  That means for a 50/50 casing with ten units of peat and ten units of verm, you'd add one unit of gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6967486</next>\n<prev>6967232</prev>\n<first>6964413</first>\n<last>25582912</last>\n<when>1180150134</when>\n<utime>05/26/07 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
