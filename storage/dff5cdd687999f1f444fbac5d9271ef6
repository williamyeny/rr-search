For water, you want the glass bulb type, and they make special calibration solutions.  For soil, Agar had a probe he trusted, but I don't know where he got it.  All the soil probes I've found are extremely inaccurate with sterile or pasteurized media.  I recommend squeezing a bit of water out of the compost or casing mix, then using a paper test strip.  Once you figure out how much lime to use, just use that amount every time.  I haven't needed to test ph in at least two years, so no need to buy an expensive tester.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5731532</next>\n<prev>5731434</prev>\n<first>5731355</first>\n<last>5737279</last>\n<when>1149896215</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 02:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
