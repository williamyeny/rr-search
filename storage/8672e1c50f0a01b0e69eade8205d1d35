I finally got some money together... and just ordered a shiny new 16 Quart Presto Pressure Cooker!! I'm so excited!!! No more OCD sterilization, or my pots running out of water when steaming and setting off my smoke alarms. Time to kill some TRICH! YEAH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you're using grains, a PC won't kill germs any deader than the steam above a regular pot of boiling water.&amp;nbsp; If you're having trouble with brf tek and steaming, you're using contaminated inoculant or not following some other sterile procedure properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pressure cooker is a great investment, but don't expect it to fix a problem other than the one which is broken.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15975678</next>\n<prev>15974879</prev>\n<first>15970343</first>\n<last>15983995</last>\n<when>1332340730</when>\n<utime>03/21/12 05:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
