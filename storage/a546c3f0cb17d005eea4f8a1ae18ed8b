That would be several hundred bucks worth of glass, and then you have the pain in the ass of sterilizing them and trying to keep them sterile until they're poured and wrapped with parafilm. I hate glass and gave all mine away years ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9070757</next>\n<prev>9070568</prev>\n<first>9070547</first>\n<last>9081005</last>\n<when>1223920067</when>\n<utime>10/13/08 08:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
