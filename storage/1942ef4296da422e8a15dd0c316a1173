Since &quot;casing&quot; material has no &quot;nutes&quot;, there is nothing in it for a contam to feed on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agar is a great friend and cultivator but he's flat-wrong on that one. He lives in a high elevation desert area with a very low ambient mold spore load. Casing soils have lots of 'nutes' that fungi such as trichoderma can feed on.&amp;nbsp; That's why they get green molds so often after a flush or two.&amp;nbsp; Sterilizing the casing material leads to a substantially higher rate of molds.&amp;nbsp; You should pasteurize only so the beneficial bacteria survive, which helps to neutralize the mold spores before they germinate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With bulk substrates, there's little or nothing to be gained from casing cubensis, and much that can be lost, such as the extra week before fruiting, and the higher risk for contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9950935</next>\n<prev>9950376</prev>\n<first>9945421</first>\n<last>9958836</last>\n<when>1236790225</when>\n<utime>03/11/09 07:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
