The metabolites are antibiotic secretions, so when they're in large amounts, it usually means something is up.  High colonization temps will also lead to metabolite production, so remember to colonize jars at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A jar with a good filter will contain any contaminants that are within, so don't toss it out.  Don't use any jar with a lot of metabolites for grain to grain transfers, but if they colonize fine, they're good to use for spawning to bulk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7083926</next>\n<prev>7082871</prev>\n<first>7082169</first>\n<last>7085677</last>\n<when>1182608379</when>\n<utime>06/23/07 05:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
