Not only do they show an obvious picture of trichoderma and call it penicillin mold(penicillium?), there are many other inaccuracies as well, temperature requirements being one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to call my video 'organic mushroom growing made easy' until I saw that one.  I have a new title now, but I won't say what it is until the video comes out.  It's in post-production now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abort, feel free to quote me on anything you wish.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6455724</next>\n<prev>6455508</prev>\n<first>6454757</first>\n<last>6455724</last>\n<when>1168719794</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 10:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
