It is a plastic storage box, sides are blacked out and I cut a hole in the lid so that light can enter from above. The hole is covered with cling film. There are NO holes punched in the box. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's little left to the imagination why it stinks, which also happens to be why you have no pins.&amp;nbsp; Air exchange is the number ONE pinning trigger, and also the number ONE defense against contamination.&amp;nbsp; Why on earth would you want a sealed up terrarium?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, light is a very important secondary pinning trigger, and blacking out the sides cuts down drastically on the amount of light your cakes get.&amp;nbsp; It seems you're going out of your way to create the worst possible environment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10301922</next>\n<prev>10301781</prev>\n<first>10301680</first>\n<last>10302910</last>\n<when>1241714325</when>\n<utime>05/07/09 07:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
