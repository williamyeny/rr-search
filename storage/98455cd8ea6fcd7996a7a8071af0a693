I usually am to absorbed in reading all the wonderful mycology to pay attention to forum related bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently you need 50 posts plus 90 days since registering to see the market place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see that rule changed because it encourages worthless post-whoring and bumping old threads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd cut the post count in half and double the time requirement to six months if it were up to me.&amp;nbsp; The idea is that we want to get to know folks before they get into the market place and start acquiring our member's physical addresses which is damned scary.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully, the assholes can't last six months before my ban hammer slaps them back where they came from.(90 days currently).&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19552605</next>\n<prev>19550865</prev>\n<first>19549716</first>\n<last>19553027</last>\n<when>1392129626</when>\n<utime>02/11/14 04:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
