What they shovel/sweep out of the barns often is mixed with cedar shavings to control odor.  If that's the case, don't get it.  Go out into the pasture and get the old, field aged stuff they don't clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry about asking.  Just knock on the front door holding a large bag and shovel, and ask for some aged manure for your garden.  They'll be glad you're there and thank you for taking it.  I've even gone to the local mounted police department stables and brought home manure to grow on.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6009101</prev>\n<first>6007118</first>\n<last>6010029</last>\n<when>1156908648</when>\n<utime>08/30/06 06:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
