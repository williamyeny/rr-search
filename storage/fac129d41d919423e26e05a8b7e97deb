I buy large filter patch bags by the thousands, but use them for sawdust/woodchip substrates, and still do grain in quart jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9480214</prev>\n<first>9475108</first>\n<last>9480284</last>\n<when>1230004291</when>\n<utime>12/23/08 05:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
