Nobody can answer your question in detail without writing a book.  In short, mushrooms don't 'conduct' moisture up into them the way plants channel water.  Mushrooms grow by cell division, and have a mycelial network, but no vascular or similar systems.  A common mistake is to think the mushroom is analogous to a plant, and the mycelium analogous to the roots.<br />RR"}}
