The bacteria present actually helps or stimulates the mushroom spores to germinate.&amp;nbsp; A second method is that the cows eat the grass where spores have landed and the spores either germinate in the cow's belly, or they are excreted intact and then grow.&amp;nbsp; I've proved this by placing spore prints into water troughs in the PNW which is far outside the natural habitat of cubensis, yet mushrooms appear when the fall rains come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indoors, we want to maximize our yields to get the most bang for our buck. That's why we've developed methods that far out-perform the wild mushroom fields.&amp;nbsp; You can take one small corner of your bedroom and grow more mushrooms than you could pick on a 100 acre cow pasture.&amp;nbsp; We do it by following techniques that we've developed for the purpose, not trying to mimic nature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9600455</next>\n<prev>9599960</prev>\n<first>9594584</first>\n<last>9601317</last>\n<when>1231864066</when>\n<utime>01/13/09 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
