I dont even flame sterilize the knife blade just lots of alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;same here after i started using alcohol in a spray bottle i dont wipe anything down before hand just spray everything then i wash afterwards so everything is ready for next time. i do this all in a sun hut also it would work the same in a closet the sun hut is 4'x4'. i think that might be the biggest reason no contains because&lt;br /&gt; once your in there is no air flow. you could do the same with plastic sheeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah the airflow is a big one, still air is a must for glovebox and alcohol is fantastic for surface sterilization, maybe not 100% contam proof, but close enough for me ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's an experiment for you three.&amp;nbsp; Put on brand new surgical/latex gloves and wash them very well with alcohol.&amp;nbsp; Then, touch your freshly alcohol washed and gloved thumb to a petri dish.&amp;nbsp; In three days, watch the thumbprint shaped mold and bacteria begin to develop and then take over the whole dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a lot of alcohol, and it cuts down drastically on contaminants.&amp;nbsp; However, it's not a substitute for flame sterilizing tools and needles until red hot, which is what anything that comes into contact with sterile media should go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no substitute for a laminar flowhood, but for those getting started in the hobby and wanting to make sure it's for them before spending the cash, a still-air or glove box is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13173376</next>\n<prev>13172633</prev>\n<first>13162239</first>\n<last>13222988</last>\n<when>1284093511</when>\n<utime>09/10/10 07:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
