My results show slightly cooler, but that could easily be strain related, a difference in measuring mycelium temp(I use infrared) or variations in thermometers/calibration procedure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15425842</next>\n<prev>15425688</prev>\n<first>15417417</first>\n<last>15431866</last>\n<when>1322328971</when>\n<utime>11/26/11 07:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
