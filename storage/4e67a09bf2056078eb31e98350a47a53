{"key":"post-13094660","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>13094660</id>\n<content>I can't count the number of 'albino strain' prints people have sent me that didn't make a single albino fruit.&amp;nbsp; I've also made it clear in the past that PE is an exception, but nobody knows exactly where it came from.&amp;nbsp; I don't believe PE was created by a cultivator, but rather found somewhere.&amp;nbsp; I know of no other exception, and in fact DNA analysis might someday put penis envy in a class by itself, but with the current&amp;nbsp; legal atmosphere, nobody is going to send it to a certified lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think the current laws making naturally occurring plants and fungi illegal are moronic.&amp;nbsp; We should be able to trade in isolates, just as the edible mushroom growers do.&amp;nbsp; When that happens, strain discussion would be on-topic right here in cultivation.&amp;nbsp; Nobody orders a shiitake strain and gets a print.&amp;nbsp; If you order shiitake 75 from aloha, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and how it's going to perform at what temperature and on what substrate, etc.&amp;nbsp; Such isn't possible with sporeprints. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's wrong with the strain thread?&amp;nbsp; I don't moderate it, leaving it to its own course.&amp;nbsp; In the past, I've wiped it clean several times so it could start over. If it's time for that again, and cervantes is on board with the rest of you, we could give the strain thread a clean slate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13094685</next>\n<prev>13094632</prev>\n<first>13094416</first>\n<last>13098038</last>\n<when>1282665931</when>\n<utime>08/24/10 07:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
