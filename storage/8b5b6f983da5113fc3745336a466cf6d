They shovel that out of the stalls and it will have fresh manure and often cedar chips mixed in to control the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the stuff from the pasture that has been sun bleached and rain leached.  It doesn't take long to walk around the center of the pasture and pick up the old, weathered grey nuggets and fill a bag with them.  Don't get any green manure, and get NOTHING that is fresh.  You want three to six month old manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6482597</next>\n<prev>6480359</prev>\n<first>6480018</first>\n<last>6483963</last>\n<when>1169405886</when>\n<utime>01/21/07 08:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
