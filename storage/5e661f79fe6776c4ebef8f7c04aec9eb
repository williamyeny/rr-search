Do as suggested above and spray a small section with 3% peroxide right out of the bottle.  If it melts on contact and disappears, it's cobweb.  If it doesn't melt on contact, it's mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4390883</next>\n<prev>4387364</prev>\n<first>4386861</first>\n<last>4390883</last>\n<when>1120958434</when>\n<utime>07/10/05 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
