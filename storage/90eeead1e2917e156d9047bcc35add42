Simply knock on the door at any house that has a horse out back.  I've never been turned away when I show up with a large trash bag and ask for horse manure for my garden.  They're always glad to have somebody haul it off for them.  Dig a hole just big enough to mix the quart jar of rye with two to four quart jars worth of manure. Cover with 1&quot; of soil and water well.  Do not use miracle grow.  Wood chips would make a nice mulch on top to keep the area shaded, but not necessary.  Put in the shade.
