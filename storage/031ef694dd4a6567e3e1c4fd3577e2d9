{"key":"post-5478399","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5478399</id>\n<content>The coir I get runs from 5.2 to 6.5 PH.  That's not much different from peat.  I recommend a teaspoon of hydrated garden lime per cup of coir or peat(don't count the verm when determining how much lime to use).  Be sure to mix the lime into the dry ingredients, then add the water.  I also recommend gypsum at the rate of a tablespoon per cup of peat or coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5478451</next>\n<prev>5478185</prev>\n<first>5477323</first>\n<last>5481421</last>\n<when>1144162853</when>\n<utime>04/04/06 06:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
