I use sticky paper.  Works like a charm.  Place it near the entrances to your grow area, and also on the inside.  They're likely breeding in your houseplants too.  A good cure for both houseplants and casings with fruit flies is dunking.  A 24 hour dunk will drown them and their larvae.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2794358</next>\n<prev>2793998</prev>\n<first>2747251</first>\n<last>17067352</last>\n<when>1087309387</when>\n<utime>06/15/04 05:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
