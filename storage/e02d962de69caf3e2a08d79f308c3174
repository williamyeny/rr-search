Cycling the light like that confuses the hell out of the mycelium, which has circadian rhythms, just like people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to get 95%+ humidity and mist regularly to keep the coir moist.  You might try laying wax paper over the tray to hold humidity high right where primordia form.  Remove it a few times per day to fan.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7900768</next>\n<prev>7898446</prev>\n<first>7898423</first>\n<last>7900872</last>\n<when>1200703787</when>\n<utime>01/19/08 02:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
