That doesn't mean you 'can't' use them to expand mycelium, but they're bulk substrates.  When you boil a bulk substrate, and then let it drain on a screen in non-sterile conditions before inoculating with spawn, you exponentially increase the chances of contamination if you expand it further.  Spawn, by definition is sterile culture.  Spawn is sterilized in sealed containers with filters, and then inoculated under sterile conditions.  Spawn can then be used under less than sterile conditions to inoculate bulk substrates.  I hope that clears up any misunderstanding on nomenclature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6362321</next>\n<prev>6362053</prev>\n<first>6361994</first>\n<last>6362321</last>\n<when>1165963999</when>\n<utime>12/13/06 12:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
