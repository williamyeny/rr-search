Many growers have tossed out perfectly good grows because they mistaked the green bruising for a contaminant. Note the birds nest grow below.  The green is bruising, not contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure:  Dunking and rolling did not cause that.  It takes several days for a contaminant such as trichoderma to go from spores to mycelium to green, so overnight couldn't possibly be related to anything that happened after birthing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is trichoderma which I doubt, it was introduced at inoculation or from improper filtering/wet filter during colonization.  Rub it gently with a q-tip and see if the green comes off.  If not, it's bruising.  If it comes off, it's a contaminant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another test is to look at the cake with a magnifying glass.  Green mold spores will be sitting on the surface as a distinct layer.  Green from bruising(or blue) will be the actual color of the mycelium, not a separate surface layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-01/641516538-Bird_Nest_009e.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-01/641516538-thumb_Bird_Nest_009e.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-01/641516556-Bird_Nest_010a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-01/641516556-thumb_Bird_Nest_010a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6213845</next>\n<prev>6213803</prev>\n<first>6213106</first>\n<last>6296941</last>\n<when>1161884723</when>\n<utime>10/26/06 08:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
