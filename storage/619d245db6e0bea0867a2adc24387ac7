You can also dump extra casing material around the edges to fill in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return to fruiting conditions right away.  The casing that is added later is for the microclimate and rarely colonizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 hours is plenty of dunk time for bulk substrates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to dunk in the sink under gently running water.  The running water prevents bacterial blooms during the dunk and also helps to wash off contaminant spores that have landed on it during the previous flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6047088</prev>\n<first>6047051</first>\n<last>6047397</last>\n<when>1157930250</when>\n<utime>09/11/06 02:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
