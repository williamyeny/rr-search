'Sterilization' is never complete, but only gives a window of opportunity to get the grains colonized.  Wait until the jars return to room temperature, and then inoculate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glass is an insulator, so if they were even slightly warm on the outside of the glass, your spores are probably cooked and doomed.  It never pays to be in a hurry in this hobby.  Waiting twelve hours to inoculate is the proper thing to do, and you don't gain anything by doing it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6881817</next>\n<prev>6881616</prev>\n<first>6881113</first>\n<last>6909553</last>\n<when>1178500893</when>\n<utime>05/07/07 04:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
