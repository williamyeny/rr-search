{"key":"post-8130644","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8130644</id>\n<content>I found no problems when using banrot, and the fruits came out normal.  It seems I used 1 tablespoon of Banrot 40WP per five gallons of soak water, but that could probably be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banrot will prevent fungi spores from germinating, but doesn't affect mycelium.  It also seems to prevent bacteria.  I once left a freshly sterilized jar of rye berries exposed to the open air for half an hour or so, then closed it up and a month later, it was still contaminant free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, good sterile procedure renders it unnecessary for grains, and while soaking casing material in it will prevent trich and cobweb, proper pasteurization and good air exchange will also prevent mold on casing layers.  I prefer growing without chemicals and am generally an organic gardener.  The Banrot experiments were simply experiments.  Dried and crushed Rhododendron leaves will also help prevent trichoderma and cobweb in casing layers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8130668</next>\n<prev>8130512</prev>\n<first>8129643</first>\n<last>18454013</last>\n<when>1205236677</when>\n<utime>03/11/08 02:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
