These can be a source of contams.  It makes little difference if it's wheat or barley straw.  I think any cereal straw will work.   </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1487486</next>\n<prev>1487432</prev>\n<first>1487432</first>\n<last>1488571</last>\n<when>1051152640</when>\n<utime>04/24/03 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
