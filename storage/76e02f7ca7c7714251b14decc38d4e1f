Also, another great trap for gnats is to drink a bottle of red wine down to the last inch or so in the bottom, and then set the bottle in or near your fc.  The gnats will enter the bottle and they're too stupid to get back out.  Eventually, they fall into the wine and drown.<br />The fruits will be fine.<br />I edited your thread title to show the nature of the post.  Lots of growers have gnat questions every spring.  It's a recurring annual problem.<br />RR"}}
