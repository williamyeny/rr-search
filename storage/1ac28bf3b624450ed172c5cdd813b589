Look for the stuff around the edges of the pile where the sun has already gone to work on it.  Don't bring home any green(fresh) nuggets and don't bring home anything with an ammonia smell.<br />Normally, the piles are what they shovel/sweep out of the stalls, and they have a lot more ammonia(urine) in them.  It's best to take your bag and shovel and walk out into the pasture and get the stuff they don't ever pick up that has been sitting out in the sun/rain.<br />RR"}}
