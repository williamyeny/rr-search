Usually, when mycelium stalls, it's due to lack of air exchange.  If you have a verm filter, take the lid all the way off for a few minutes and then put it back on.  If the mycelium starts to grow again, you know that was the problem.  Make sure the inoculation/gas exchange holes are open.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7121589</next>\n<prev>7121017</prev>\n<first>7118811</first>\n<last>7124270</last>\n<when>1183426324</when>\n<utime>07/03/07 04:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
