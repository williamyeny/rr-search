The second is that a high CO2 level impedes the growth of most competitor fungi, so if those organisms are present, your mushroom mycelium will be at an advantage. The third is we've found a reduction in CO2 along with the other pinning triggers helps contribute to great pinsets.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19244434</next>\n<prev>19243766</prev>\n<first>19240937</first>\n<last>19249103</last>\n<when>1386520807</when>\n<utime>12/08/13 06:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
