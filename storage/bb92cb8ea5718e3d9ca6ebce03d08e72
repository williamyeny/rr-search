Simply dunk to rehydrate the substrate and return to fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to recommend dunking in the refrigerator, because in part, that was the conventional wisdom.  I no longer believe that's the best course of action, so dunk at normal room temperature, beginning the dunk with cold tap water, but no ice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larger trays can be easily soaked by placing under the kitchen or bathtub faucet, allowing the tray to fill up and gently run over the edge for a few hours.  Put something on top of the substrate if it tries to float.  The running water will help to wash away contaminant spores that may have landed, while preventing excess bacterial blooms that may occur under still water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7991714</next>\n<prev>7991461</prev>\n<first>7980462</first>\n<last>8004966</last>\n<when>1202413211</when>\n<utime>02/07/08 09:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
