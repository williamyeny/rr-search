{"key":"post-8306239","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8306239</id>\n<content>Tyvek is functional and cheap or free.  However, synthetic filter disks last for many years and thousands of uses.  Tyvek tends to get ripped at the edges of the lid, often resulting in only one use. It can also twist, making the lid very hard to get off later for G2G or other procedures. The time spent cutting tyvek to shape each time will easily outweigh any cost advantage.  Even though I sell tyvek on my website, I still prefer filter disks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, any material that provides filtered gas exchange is going to work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8306247</next>\n<prev>8306199</prev>\n<first>8305940</first>\n<last>8306250</last>\n<when>1208663841</when>\n<utime>04/20/08 06:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
