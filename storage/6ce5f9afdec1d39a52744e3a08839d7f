Try to stir it around as little as possible.  A TON of contaminant spores are being released by the minute.  When you return, strip and put your clothes in the washing machine, then shower.  Afterward, clean the heck out of your entire grow area.  You'll need to wash everything down with a 10% bleach solution to kill the contaminant spores that have already been released.<br />Some may advise to try and save that thing.  I disagree.  Those mushies will be fine to eat, but you need to get it out of your growing area to protect future crops from mold.  If you have a spot in the shade outside, and the temps are warm enough, it might recover and grow.  If you have a garden with rich soil, bury it there.  It will flush again this summer outside.<br />RR"}}
