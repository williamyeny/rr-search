Other, non-active species also bruise blue, so I'm not too sure it's an indication of anything.<br />I've made many side by side grows with all sorts of supplements and haven't found a single one that I can document an increased potency from.  At one time or another, I've tried everything in this thread, as well as just about everything ever suggested in the other duplicate threads on the subject, as well as dozens of substrate materials.  Personally, none of them gave even a percieved increase in potency.  Those were the experiments that led me to believe potency in mushrooms to be genetic.<br />RR"}}
