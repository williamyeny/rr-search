However, despite their efforts, they got fruits.&amp;nbsp; They then attributed the fact that their trays fruited to the cold shock, and a myth was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer months, if your 'cold' water is pretty warm, I'd suggest dunking in the refrigerator, just to prevent any fermentation while the cake is underwater.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the year, just use cold tap water and dunk at normal room temp.&amp;nbsp; More valuable then using cold water though is the rinse before and after the dunk with running water.&amp;nbsp; You'll notice the cakes are somewhat slimy after a dunk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9938032</next>\n<prev>9937640</prev>\n<first>9934568</first>\n<last>9938469</last>\n<when>1236582436</when>\n<utime>03/09/09 10:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
