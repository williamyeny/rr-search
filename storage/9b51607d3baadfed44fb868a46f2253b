A humidifier won't give as high a humidity as the perlite does.  If you're worried, just get a humidifier and run it in the room the terrarium is located in, but not into the terrarium itself.  Get a hygrometer and make sure to calibrate it properly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5802798</next>\n<prev>5800887</prev>\n<first>5800871</first>\n<last>5804541</last>\n<when>1151590040</when>\n<utime>06/29/06 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
