Even after just a 12 hour soak I see little tap roots trying to come out of my grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boil grains ten to twenty minutes sometimes after soaking.&amp;nbsp; It all depends on how busy I am at the time.&amp;nbsp; Five minutes is probably long enough though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your grains are germinating during the soak, then you're not beginning the soak in hot enough water.&amp;nbsp; Either heat it on the stove or turn up the setting on your water heater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't bump your own thread in the future until after 24 hours has passed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15552941</next>\n<prev>15551199</prev>\n<first>15549418</first>\n<last>15557886</last>\n<when>1324506334</when>\n<utime>12/22/11 12:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
