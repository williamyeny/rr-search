I plan on steam-sterilizing my 1/2pt jars of substrate on top of rocks in a pot. I have some questions.<br />1. Should the water be able to touch the bottoms of the jars?<br />2. Can I simply put tape over the top of my jars, inoculate, and put the lid on? Or is it completely necessary to drill holes in the jars?<br />3. Does anyone have suggestions for the most budget-friendly shroom-growing chamber possible?<br />Thanks.</blockquote><br />It sounds like you haven't found the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Brown Rice Flour Tek Videos</a> yet.<br />RR"}}
