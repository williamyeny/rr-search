Perhaps you can spend a few years learning the ropes instead of constantly trying to contradict what those who have been doing this(and teaching people like you) for many years have found through trial and error over the course of many thousands of projects.  You are calling everyone from me to paul stamets wrong, yet you offer no verification or pictures to show that your ways are superior.  It's all talk, and nothing but talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that many new growers get a first harvest and think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, so whatever techniques they used, they recommend to others.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, experienced growers here will never give advice on the easiest way, the laziest way, the cheapest way, etc., but will advise on the &lt;b&gt;best&lt;/b&gt; way to not only achieve a pinset, but on a wall-to-wall pinset that will rock your socks.  There are varying degrees of success in this hobby.  A Geo will get you from point A to point B, but for newbie drivers to give advice that a Geo is the best car to get you up a rugged mountain trail instead of a Jeep, only speaks of ignorance and inexperience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighting questions have been resolved for at least a decade, if not longer. Many newbies are more than happy with a BE of 50%, while the experienced growers consider anything less than a BE of 100% to 200% to be failure.  It's all in the 'degree of success' one seeks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7507826</prev>\n<first>7492283</first>\n<last>7508352</last>\n<when>1192120223</when>\n<utime>10/11/07 07:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
