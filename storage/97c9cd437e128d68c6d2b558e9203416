The damn cop walked up to my car while I was stuck in a traffic jam(parking lot) and said I was doing 60km/hour in a 30km/hr zone.  Hell, I was parked.  It still cost me $100 to get away, and the money went right into the corrupt bastards pocket. (He had the gun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bet that unit has been stripped of everything worthwhile, except the asbestos of course.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7029466</next>\n<prev>7029391</prev>\n<first>7028777</first>\n<last>7049674</last>\n<when>1181486380</when>\n<utime>06/10/07 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
