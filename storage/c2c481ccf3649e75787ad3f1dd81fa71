Leave it at 12/12, or simply put your fruiting chamber near a bright window.  Many years of successful growing has taught us that 12/12 is the best sequence.  Mushrooms will not fruit well from a minute of light per day, nor will they fruit well from a few hours.  They do best when exposed to a normal day/night routine based on the 24 hour day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8357807</prev>\n<first>8357618</first>\n<last>8357907</last>\n<when>1209846266</when>\n<utime>05/03/08 11:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
