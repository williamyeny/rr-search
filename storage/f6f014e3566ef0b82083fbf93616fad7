That species of aspergillis mold grows on feed corn in damp barns.  It takes a LONG time to produce aflatoxins.  The corn used in that dog food was very old.  Aflatoxins are a threat to cattle and other livestock that are fed uncooked, feed corn that has been stored for a long time with molds growing on it.<br />The sterilization process would kill any live molds before you used it to grow on.  If green molds, including aspergillis flavus formed on the substrate, the mushroom crop would be long harvested before any aflatoxins would be produced.  <br />RR"}}
