There is so much surface area due to the large kernel size that it doesn't take much mycelium to cover a jar full of popcorn.  WBS and rye have much smaller kernel size, thus more total surface area for the mycelium to colonize, resulting in much more mycelium for a given jar size.  That's why it takes longer for a quart of rye to colonize than a quart of popcorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above aside, popcorn is a medeocre producer at best.  When spawned to bulk substrate, the large kernels get the mycelium scraped off them, which now takes longer to recover than a small kernel, while exposed to manure or straw which hasn't been sterilized.  Most growers report much higher contaminant rates with popcorn.  Additionaly, popcorn is the lowest in natural triptophans of any of the common spawn materials.  I quit using it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4899952</next>\n<prev>4897952</prev>\n<first>4897520</first>\n<last>4900631</last>\n<when>1131245448</when>\n<utime>11/06/05 04:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
