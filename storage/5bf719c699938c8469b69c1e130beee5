For quart or liter jars, I'd suggest 2ml, and squirt it against the glass so it runs down the side.&amp;nbsp; Don't shake afterward.&amp;nbsp; Wait for about 25% colonization and then shake the jar to distribute the colonized grains.&amp;nbsp; After the shake, it should be fully colonized within a week.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9054673</next>\n<prev>9054499</prev>\n<first>9052447</first>\n<last>9061042</last>\n<when>1223591602</when>\n<utime>10/10/08 01:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
