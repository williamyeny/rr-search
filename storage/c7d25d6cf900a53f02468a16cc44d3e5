You can pasteurize just by pouring boiling water into a bucket and putting a lid on?</blockquote><br />No, you can not.&nbsp; Pasteurization involves slowly heating a substrate to 140F and keeping it there for an hour or so, without allowing it to exceed 160F.&nbsp; Pour boiling water on any material that has coffee grinds in it and you'll have green mold before it ever colonizes.<br />Proper pasteurization is no secret.&nbsp; It's been around for decades.<br />RR"}}
