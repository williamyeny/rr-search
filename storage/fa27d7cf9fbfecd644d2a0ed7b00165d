{"key":"post-4032500","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4032500</id>\n<content>I've found it makes a huge difference in the amount of water grains will absorb during the soak whether you begin the soak with hot or cold water.  If you'll begin with hot tap water, the grains will absorb twice as much during the soak.  I like to stir a bit of gypsum into the water so it gets absorbed at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4032504</next>\n<prev>4032490</prev>\n<first>4032482</first>\n<last>4032594</last>\n<when>1113015967</when>\n<utime>04/09/05 06:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
