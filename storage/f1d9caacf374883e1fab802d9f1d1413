I've used large hedge clippers before, but what a pain in the ass.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />That being said, I will say again. I have never had a contam with hay. I don't understand why people say its more likely to contract a contam because something is more nutritious. Its not like a contam controls where it goes... It just floats through the air until it happens to land on your work. </blockquote><br />The biggest problem with hay is the seeds that are in it tend to make an ideal habitat for molds.&nbsp; Pasteurize with lime, to RAISE the pH.&nbsp; I don't know of anybody who uses gypsum with straw.&nbsp; Use gypsum with coir, and never try to adjust the coir pH down, because it's already about a pH of 5.&nbsp; Bacteria is not a contaminant of bulk substrates-Green molds are, and the lower the pH, the greater the chances of trichoderma.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-006/108452877-SEM_of_Straw.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-006/108452877-thumb_SEM_of_Straw.jpg\"></a>"}}
