Spores strored in distilled water don't dry out the way they do on a print.<br />For live mycelium, I inoculate a test tube slant of agar.  When the mycelium has colonized the agar in the test tube, I pour a small amount of distilled water over the top of the mycelium, then place the test tube in the refrigerator for long term storage.  Once per year, take out the test tube and transfer the mycelium to a new test tube and repeat the process.<br />RR"}}
