The coolmists should be plenty. In fact, one coolmist will probably do the trick.  My greenhouse is three times that size and two keep it at 95%+ and that's running only one minute at a time, with five to six minutes of off time. I'll bet any kind of synthetic material can hold the humidity.  The question is how long it will last without molding.<br />RR"}}
