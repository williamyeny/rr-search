I'm no fan of using aquarium pumps for FAE.  Mushrooms want more fresh air than fish do.  I'd just leave the lid crooked, or drill holes in the tub.  Even then, try to fan a time or two per day.  You simply can't have too much FAE, provided you keep up with misting so your substrate doesn't dry out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6655816</next>\n<prev>6655770</prev>\n<first>6655770</first>\n<last>6657669</last>\n<when>1173560543</when>\n<utime>03/10/07 11:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
