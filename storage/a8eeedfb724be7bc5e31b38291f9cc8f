Being fresh wasn't the reason you got sick...it was because the mushroom was growing with trichoderma! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that was true, you'd get sick every time you ate an onion, carrot, potato, peanuts, radish, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trichoderma is a beneficial organism in the soil, and organic gardeners order cultures of it to put into their soil to increase yields and disease resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trichoderma is NOT toxic to healthy humans, and is not an intestinal poison when consumed.  Please don't spread disinformation on the boards.
