It's very well known.</blockquote><br />Do you have a verm filter on the brf jars you'll be using as donor jars?&nbsp; If so, it will contaminate your receiving jars.&nbsp; It's awfully hard to scrape it off without getting any contaminant spores on the brf mix.<br />You'll still need gas exchange after the transfer, so drill holes in the lid and use a filter.<br />RR"}}
