Casing should be mixed up fresh just before use.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People need to bear in mind, when I give a suggestion like that, it doesn't mean doing something different is guaranteed to fail, but it means that for best results do as suggested.  Casing mixes should be pasteurized, and that means they need to be used right away.  Some growers sterilize casing mix which gives longer shelf life, but also medeocre performance compared to pasteurization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5882306</next>\n<prev>5882114</prev>\n<first>5882033</first>\n<last>5882306</last>\n<when>1153440245</when>\n<utime>07/21/06 03:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
