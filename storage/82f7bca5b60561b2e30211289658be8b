On a petri dish, mycelium will grow fastest at 86F, but that doesn't mean it's optimal because molds and bacteria also do very well at that temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom mycelium is &lt;i&gt;tolerant&lt;/i&gt; of lower temperatures, but molds and bacteria are &lt;i&gt;less tolerant&lt;/i&gt;.   Also, colonizing mycelium produces its own heat.  I suggest no more than 80F for colonizing quart jars of grains, because this will give you very close to the 86F 'optimum' without encouraging molds and thermophilic bacteria.  Personally, I use 75F, and have no use for incubators and the breakdowns, fire hazzards, and stale air within them.  If it's cold in your room, run a small heater and heat the entire area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6207260</next>\n<prev>6206215</prev>\n<first>6202050</first>\n<last>6208709</last>\n<when>1161728256</when>\n<utime>10/25/06 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
