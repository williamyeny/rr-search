If the jars didn't colonize due to excessive moisture that ran to the bottom, it will help, by draining it to the other end of the jar.  Some growers think flipping upside down is to release CO2, but this is incorrect.  The heat produced by the mycelium produces circulation that does that job.<br />I've never yet had a jar that wouldn't colonize the bottom, provided it was made correctly to begin with, using the proper amount of water AND the correct jars, which you don't have.  BRF cakes do best in short fat jars, such as wide mouth half pints.<br />RR"}}
