{"key":"post-12789444","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>12789444</id>\n<content>What I've posted many times is that when you see cobweb, you should spray it until the casing layer or substrate is wet with 3% peroxide, three times at 12 hour intervals.&amp;nbsp; Don't wait for it to come back before spraying.&amp;nbsp; Simply wait 12 hours and wet the whole thing down again.&amp;nbsp; If you do this three times, the problem will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, by 3% peroxide, I mean that's the strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution.&amp;nbsp; If you live in the US and buy it in brown bottles at the grocery store, it's already diluted to 3%, so use it right from the bottle.&amp;nbsp; If you live where it's sold in 10% strength, dilute one part peroxide to 2 parts distilled water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the presence of cobweb(Dactylium) indicates a lack of fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; Cobweb won't grow in a properly vented fruiting chamber.&amp;nbsp; If you're finding it in the spawn run stage, it indicates improper pasteurization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12789508</next>\n<prev>12789358</prev>\n<first>12779468</first>\n<last>12799212</last>\n<when>1277307978</when>\n<utime>06/23/10 06:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
