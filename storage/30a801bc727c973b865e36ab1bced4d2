You want maximum FAE, high humidity, and bright light, especially with cased substrates.  The light needs to be bright enough to penetrate the casing layer for best results.  'Some' pins will form with low levels of light, but if you want the WOW factor, use bright fluorescent light or sunlight from a window.  They do best with a period of darkness each day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7121329</next>\n<prev>7121035</prev>\n<first>7120965</first>\n<last>7121339</last>\n<when>1183428879</when>\n<utime>07/03/07 05:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
