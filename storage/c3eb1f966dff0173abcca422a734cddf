The surface doesn't harden up properly and the mycelium tends to colonize the whole plate, not just the surface, completely defeating the purpose of petri dishes in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antibiotics such as Gentmycin sulphate will help protect against bacteria, but do nothing to slow down fungi such as trichoderma or the other contaminants of mushroom culture.  Sterile technique is the key to avoiding contaminants of all kinds in our art.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8110354</next>\n<prev>8110110</prev>\n<first>8104107</first>\n<last>8110354</last>\n<when>1204818604</when>\n<utime>03/06/08 05:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
