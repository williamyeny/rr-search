Also, 1/4 cc is too much to use in a petri dish.  Only add a drop or two.  A spore syringe will already be diluted enough for isolation.  <br />Don't look for rhizomorphic sectors because they rarely show up right away.  You will want to transfer all the sectors you find to new dishes.  It will take two or three transfers before you begin to see rhizomorphic growth. In fact, you may not even see sectoring on the first dish if lots of spores have germinated. The reason is that so many substrains will be growing that it will look like a mass of cottony mycelium. If that's the case, just take ten or so pieces the size of a grain of rice from around the leading edge of the growth.  <br />You'll see sectoring when they begin to grow out. Be sure to grow out several of the sectors on grains, then to fruiting, because some are sure to be bunk, but one or two will be awesome.    <br />I hope you have several sleeves of petri dishes.   I usually go through two or three sleeves of the three section petri dishes doing isolations, so if you're using single dishes, you may need more.  However, if you're going to transfer every two or three days, you can transfer three or four pieces of mycelium to each dish on the second and third rounds even if you're using non-divided petri dishes. Good luck.<br />RR"}}
