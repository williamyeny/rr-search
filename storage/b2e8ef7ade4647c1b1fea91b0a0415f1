Anyway, my point is we don't hear the old hands worrying about strains, but even with the stickied strain thead, we have to lock a few a day for those who ignore, or don't see it.  It was crazy before when three or four strain threads would be active on the same page, with people jumping back and forth between them arguing and taking up the first page away from those who needed actual help with their grows.  That's why we stickied it up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By lame, I meant considering it an equal or even superior factor to the right growing environment, procedures, lighting, substrate, blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7953323</next>\n<prev>7952934</prev>\n<first>7946995</first>\n<last>7955062</last>\n<when>1201668304</when>\n<utime>01/30/08 06:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
