It's best to squirt solution in the area between the bag and the grains.  This lets you see right away after germination what you have.  Five to seven days is about normal for first growth to be seen if you inject the edges.  Since you injected the middle, double that at least.   I'd suggest waiting two weeks, then kneading the bag between your fingers to mix it up.  Doing so should reveal some mycelium from the center of the bag, and the kneading will spread it around the bag.   Only do this once, ten days from now.<br />RR"}}
