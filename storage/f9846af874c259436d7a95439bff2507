Pans like it around 80F during fruiting, so keep the temp up.  They also take around ten days to two weeks to pin once placed into fruiting conditions, so make sure your casing is properly limed to resist contaminants during the longer initiating cycle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5872932</next>\n<prev>5872853</prev>\n<first>5858876</first>\n<last>5909047</last>\n<when>1153238260</when>\n<utime>07/18/06 06:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
