Azurescens require a cold shock to fruit as do most other cold weather mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold shocking is a myth with cubensis and not required.  Cubes naturally grow in tropical climates and fruit very well in Florida and Texas in 80+ temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many growers think because they cold shocked their project, then got pins a few days later it was the cold that triggered pinning.  Fact is, they would have pinned anyway, perhaps sooner.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4928386</next>\n<prev>4928251</prev>\n<first>4926608</first>\n<last>4928386</last>\n<when>1131896202</when>\n<utime>11/13/05 05:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
