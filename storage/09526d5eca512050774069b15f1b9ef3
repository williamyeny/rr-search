He also labled a picture of trichoderma which is a mold as a virus, then said microscope ID found it to be anthrax, which happens to be a bacteria...lol  If it had actually been anthrax, which is not a contaminant of mushroom culture, he'd be dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, never cook bulk substrates in an oven.  That kills the beneficial bacteria, leading to mold attacks.  Folks would be best advised to ignore that link and the information within.  It's full of blatant errors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6256934</next>\n<prev>6256622</prev>\n<first>6255928</first>\n<last>6257004</last>\n<when>1162917471</when>\n<utime>11/07/06 06:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
