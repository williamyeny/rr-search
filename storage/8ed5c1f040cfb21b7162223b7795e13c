{"key":"post-6575583","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6575583</id>\n<content>Any jar, whether 1/2 pint pf, or quart jar of grains that isn't fully colonized in 30 days at room temperature has a serious problem.  Make up a fresh batch and start over.  Don't use an incubator next time and keep the jars at 75F to 80F on a shelf so they get air.  The biggest cause of stalled jars is running out of air, and the second is bacterial contamination which is increased exponentially by keeping in a sealed box at high temperature.  There is ZERO increase in rate of growth above 80F, and it falls off rapidly shortly after that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6585861</next>\n<prev>6575456</prev>\n<first>6575147</first>\n<last>6617814</last>\n<when>1171675656</when>\n<utime>02/17/07 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
