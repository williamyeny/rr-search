My conditions are about 72* F and the humidity level is high enough that there is condensation on the walls of my chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's condensation on the walls, you have a serious problem.&amp;nbsp; It means there's a temperature differential between inside the tub and outside, therefore you're not getting proper fresh air exchange or there would be none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like you failed to build a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Build one and your humidity will be upper 90's% along with proper fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; There will be zero condensation on the walls of a shotgun terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17395990</next>\n<prev>17395790</prev>\n<first>17395727</first>\n<last>17396753</last>\n<when>1355584322</when>\n<utime>12/15/12 05:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
