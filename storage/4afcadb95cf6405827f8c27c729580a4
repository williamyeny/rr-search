In the time you can fill an 18 wheeler with grain spawn via grain to grain transfers, you'll have enough LC for maybe fifty jars at most. I wasn't calling &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; who use liquid culture lame, I was referring to the method of squirting spores into sugar water, which should have been obvious.&amp;nbsp; This isn't something new.&amp;nbsp; I've been saying it since I registered here, and was saying the same thing on other boards and the newsgroup ADM long before that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10740361</next>\n<prev>10740220</prev>\n<first>10730810</first>\n<last>10760987</last>\n<when>1248582317</when>\n<utime>07/26/09 07:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
