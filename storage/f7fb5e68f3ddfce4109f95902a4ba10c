Pay special attention to the beveled mating surfaces of the cooker and lid, making sure there's no scratches or dings in that area. If there's no damage, it's fine.&amp;nbsp; Spare/replacement parts, such as gauges, nozzles/weights, toggle valves, etc., are all readily available.&amp;nbsp; $70 is a great deal even if it does need a new gauge or nozzle/weight assembly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12331251</next>\n<prev>12331008</prev>\n<first>12330828</first>\n<last>12331251</last>\n<when>1270426968</when>\n<utime>04/05/10 03:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
