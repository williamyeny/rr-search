The idea with pasteurization is for the bacteria to survive, while killing the mold spores which die at a much lower temperature.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, bacteria is only a problem with your spawn, be it brf, rye, wbs, whatever.  Once your spawn is fully colonized and placed into a bulk substrate, bacteria is your &lt;i&gt;friend&lt;/i&gt; as it helps to keep the substrate alive, therefore resisting molds such as trichoderma.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5800148</prev>\n<first>5799712</first>\n<last>5800261</last>\n<when>1151539371</when>\n<utime>06/29/06 03:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
