I described a method to generate ten times as much LC in a shorter period of time without contamination.  I'm not against liquid culture.  I use it all the time.  I'm simply dead against the idea of squirting a syringe into a bottle of karo/water.  I insist on having at least some verification my LC is good before I inject a bunch of jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analogy of a new growers greatest fear doesn't hold water.  If his pf jars contaminated due to contaminated spores/syringe, it does no good to have even ten gallons of contaminated LC on hand.  If they contaminated due to his sloppy procedure, he's likely to have used the same sloppy procedure making an LC.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my posts, I always try to show a way to have the greatest possible success rate, not necessarily the cheapest, easiest or laziest method.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6344768</next>\n<prev>6344744</prev>\n<first>6343358</first>\n<last>27872587</last>\n<when>1165526483</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 11:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
