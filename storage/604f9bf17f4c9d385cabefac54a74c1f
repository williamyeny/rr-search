I recommend 1 teaspoon of hydrated per cup of peat as a starting point because that's rarely too much.  The best thing is to get some pH strips to measure it properly.  I also add gypsum at ten percent by volume to the amount of the peat moss. Mix the dry ingredients first, and then hydrate and pasteurize as per RK's link above.<br />RR"}}
