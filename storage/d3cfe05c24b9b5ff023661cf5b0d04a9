A cow has 1 stomach.  A single stomach with four compartments is not 4 stomachs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cow manure is NOT already composted when it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aged horse manure or cow manure does NOT need to be leached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing/leaching manure does NOT remove ammonia.  It needs to be air dried or cured in the sun to &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;evaporate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not want fresh cow manure.  You want aged manure.  Cow patties work fine.  In fact, when I first started growing mushrooms in 1971, picking up cow pies and bringing them home to place in compost was the only way we knew to home cultivate.  All the current teks have evolved from those early trials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly which shroomery manure teks suck for people in colder climates?  What difference does a cold climate make?  Moisture and ammonia will &lt;u&gt;sublimate&lt;/u&gt; from frozen manure as fast as it will evaporate from manure in a warm climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growers can be successful with &lt;i&gt;aged&lt;/i&gt; manure by simply breaking it up and using after hydration and pasteurization.  In fact, I've NEVER leached manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6321129</next>\n<prev>6320781</prev>\n<first>6320249</first>\n<last>6321749</last>\n<when>1164905627</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 06:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
