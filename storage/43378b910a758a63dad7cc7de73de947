Does that make me a puppet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, what makes you think beginners so impatient that they need a website to tell them who are the bad suppliers?  It won't work anyway.  Most who get scammed by bad vendors simply did an internet search and placed an order long before they even found the shroomery.  Those who frequent here already know who is safe to order from.  A bad vendor list is a bad idea that will only cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5860989</next>\n<prev>5860647</prev>\n<first>5856929</first>\n<last>5861008</last>\n<when>1152970010</when>\n<utime>07/15/06 04:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
