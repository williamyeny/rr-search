It's rare for mycelium to win the battle over bacteria, but I've seen it many times.  There is NO siphoning of contaminants other than heavy metals.  That is silly.  The mycelium is a living organism that metabolizes the substrate, including bacteria and molds which are thriving in the natural environment.   We toss out contaminated projects indoors to save our future projects from failure due to massive spore release, not to save ourselves from imaginary toxins.  If it looks and smells ok, it is ok.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5974584</next>\n<prev>5974117</prev>\n<first>5973459</first>\n<last>5974584</last>\n<when>1155874808</when>\n<utime>08/18/06 07:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
