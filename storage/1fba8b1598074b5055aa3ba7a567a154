Pressure goes UP one psi for every 10 degrees farenhiet. Put a ballon in the freezer and watch it deflate. Cold air is more dense and therefor has LOWER pressure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't confuse what happens in an enclosed vessel with what happens in free air, such as a shotgun terrarium full of holes.&amp;nbsp; The highest pressure on the planet occurs in the arctic areas during winter, and the lowest pressure occurs in the tropics during summer.&amp;nbsp; You're arguing physics without a basic understanding of processes involved.&amp;nbsp; Sorry to be harsh.&amp;nbsp; Keep reading and studying though.&amp;nbsp; It's how we all learn.&amp;nbsp; Air expands when heated.&amp;nbsp; That means the molecules are farther apart, resulting in &lt;i&gt;lower pressure&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We can artificially create pressure by heating air in a vessel such as a hot air balloon, but that doesn't simulate what happens in free air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12561435</next>\n<prev>12560617</prev>\n<first>12552953</first>\n<last>12561505</last>\n<when>1273850701</when>\n<utime>05/14/10 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
