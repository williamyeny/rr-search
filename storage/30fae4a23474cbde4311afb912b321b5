All you really need is a 12 hour soak to soften the grains, then simmer until the kernels have doubled in size.  The presoak helps to soften up the grains so they don't burst when you simmer.  If you soak longer than 24 hours, you can usually skip the simmer, but I like to do it anyway so the steam can help evaporate excess moisture off them while they drain.  You want them to feel slightly dry on the surface when you load your jars.  The moisture you need is inside the kernels.  If you have excess moisture on the grains/seeds, it tends to run down to the bottom of the jar where it makes colonization slow and encourages bacteria.<br />RR"}}
