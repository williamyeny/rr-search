You'll want to use them as a substrate.  When you pick up a handfull, no water should drip out.  If you squeeze gently, one or two drops will fall.  If you squeeze hard, several drops to a small stream will run out for a second or two, then stop.  Just adjust to that point and it will work well.<br />RR"}}
