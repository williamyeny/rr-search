I don't mind buying / building equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Rabbit prepares a full 50 pound bag of rye into filter patch bags every day.&amp;nbsp; She starts the process each day and then lets the grains soak overnight.&amp;nbsp; Each day, there's a new batch to rinse and soak, and a soaked batch to boil, dry, and load into bags to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't ever heard her bitch about it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15015842</prev>\n<first>15011853</first>\n<last>15016222</last>\n<when>1314967333</when>\n<utime>09/02/11 03:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
