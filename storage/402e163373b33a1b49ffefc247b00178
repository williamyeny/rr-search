You can make a large glovebox out of a large rubbermaid tub that will hold a dozen jars or more.  In the absence of a flow hood, you want STILL air as said above for sterile work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bathrooms and kitchens are the two least sterile rooms in any house.  Build a glovebox and use it in a closed up(after cleaning) closet.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7082908</next>\n<prev>7082797</prev>\n<first>7079360</first>\n<last>7082966</last>\n<when>1182608832</when>\n<utime>06/23/07 05:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
