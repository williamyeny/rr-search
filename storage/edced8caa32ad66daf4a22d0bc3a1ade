Sometimes we say the same thing by phrasing it as 'fresh air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger' because a constant supply of fresh air causes drying of the substrate.&nbsp; This loss of moisture from the substrate must be replaced by misting, dunking, or some other method.<br />If you put a substrate where it can wick a constant supply of water from geolite, perlite, or water, etc., pinning performance will be poor because the substrate will saturate or waterlog.&nbsp; You want your substrate to begin to dry out. . .and then replace that water, before allowing it to dry out again.&nbsp; That's the way to best performance.&nbsp; Use foil, jar lids, etc., to separate the cakes from the geolite or perlite.<br />RR"}}
