Horse owners are glad to get rid of anything you'll haul off for them.<br />Here's a suggestion though.  Knock on the door with a bag and shovel in your hand and ask for some horse <b>manure</b> for your garden.  If you say 'poo', they'll think you're some kind of little kid and wonder what you're up to.  Manure is for growing mushrooms and/or gardens.  Poo is what babies leave in their diapers.<br />RR"}}
