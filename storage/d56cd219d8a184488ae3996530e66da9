I make substrates on the dry side so they colonize faster, and then dunk before first flush.  A two inch substrate and 1/2&quot; casing layer should be plenty to get nice sized fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't show the use of coffee in the video because it's optional anyway, and I was afraid people would use too much, which actually slows down colonization.  Better safe than sorry.  I had it all filmed with coffee, and then decided to film that segment over again without it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7498718</next>\n<prev>7498641</prev>\n<first>7498612</first>\n<last>7499095</last>\n<when>1191887775</when>\n<utime>10/09/07 02:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
