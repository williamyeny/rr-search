Just inoculate some grains or brf in the standard way and you'll be miles ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to make LC for inoculation, here's a way to get 100 syringes full of inoculant in two weeks: 1) Inoculate a quart jar of rye berries or wbs with your spores.  Upon full colonization, shake the jar to loosen each individual kernel.  Be sure to give it the smell test to make sure it smells like fresh mushrooms. 2) PC a quart of distilled water in a jar with a filter disk or tyvek, etc.   In a glovebox or in front of a flowhood, pour 2/3 of the quart jar of sterilized water into your jar of shaken grains.  3) Shake well and then pour the now mycelium rich water back into whatever was left of your jar of sterilized water. Use the jar lid to hold back the grains themselves from pouring out.  You now have a full quart of highly concentrated mycelium water that can then be used as is, or diluted two or three times again, and used to fill syringes.  Because the grains were shaken first, the mycelium is ripped into shreds and will be sucked through even small needles easily, although larger needles always work better for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, mycelium grows poorly in water unless under constant stir which oxygenates it.  With grains, they colonize in two weeks or less because oxygen is throughout the jar in the spaces between the kernels.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6344185</next>\n<prev>6343398</prev>\n<first>6343358</first>\n<last>27872587</last>\n<when>1165514913</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 08:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
