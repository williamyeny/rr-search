It's intended to break down in your lawn over a period of months to even years.  The average life of a casing layer is three to four weeks, so the pelletized stuff won't do squat.<br />Mix hydrated <i>garden</i> lime to your dry peat at the rate of one teaspoon per cup of peat.  That should give you a great starting point.<br />RR"}}
