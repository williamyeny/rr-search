Substrates do.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to duplicate nature, forget sterile culture and grow outdoors.  INdoors, you need to sterilize spawn and pasteurize bulk substrates, and then hope your desired mycelium takes over the available food before contaminants.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't try to combine indoor and outdoor in the same grow or you'll deposit contaminant spores all over your house, which will make future grows more of a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8084135</prev>\n<first>8075050</first>\n<last>8085628</last>\n<when>1204307338</when>\n<utime>02/29/08 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
