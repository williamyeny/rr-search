Anything above 80F gives absolutely no increase in rate of growth, and growth slows down dramatically at 83F and above.  I've proved this time and time again with thousands of grows.  That's why I incubate all jars at normal room temperature on an open shelf.  The pf jars you see on the bottom shelf were fully colonized within 2 weeks.   I challenge any of you incubator growers to match that using 86F.  You won't be able to.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg\"></a>"}}
