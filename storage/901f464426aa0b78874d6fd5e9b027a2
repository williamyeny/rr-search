All work must be done in a glovebox or in front of a laminar flow hood.  There is no part of sterile procedure that can be skipped.  I rarely ever inoculate grains without looking at the culture under the microscope first to ensure it's free of bacteria and/or molds.  On agar, it's easy to see both, so there's really no excuse for inoculating grains with a contaminated culture.  Once inoculated, if the grains were properly sterilized, and the lid has a proper filter, there's little that can go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7001914</next>\n<prev>7001612</prev>\n<first>7000584</first>\n<last>7015382</last>\n<when>1180847894</when>\n<utime>06/03/07 08:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
