Gypsum at ten percent is fine, but that 5% might be a bit heavy on the lime, depending on the peat source.  I usually start out with a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  Your recipe above is showing about a teaspoon and a half.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6383613</prev>\n<first>6378964</first>\n<last>6383862</last>\n<when>1166486162</when>\n<utime>12/19/06 01:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
