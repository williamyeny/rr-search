I didn't realize how sick I had become until I moved out, and it nearly killed the mrs. The only thing you can do is rip all the sheetrock off the walls, rip the moldy studs out and replace them with fresh. Replace the floor boards and carpet, etc.&amp;nbsp; You have to rip the ceiling out and replace all the damp insulation and joists.&amp;nbsp; It's all extremely expensive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for your own health would be to move to a newer building unless you own the condo and want to pony up several thousand to fix it.&amp;nbsp; Then of course, you'll still get sick from your neighbors places.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type of molds in sick buildings rarely affects mushroom grows.&amp;nbsp; If you're getting trich or aspergillus, etc., fresh air exchange is the key.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10645817</next>\n<prev>10644359</prev>\n<first>10643235</first>\n<last>10645896</last>\n<when>1247116664</when>\n<utime>07/09/09 08:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
