You want to monitor the substrate temperature, not the water temperature.  Put the meat thermometer into the center of the bag of substrate, and adjust the stove burner as needed to maintain 140F to 160F for an hour.(60C-70C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually pasteurize in quart jars rather than bags.  I bring the water in the kettle to a full boil for a few minutes, and then as the substrate temperature reaches the desired low end of the temperature range, I shut off the stove and put the lid on the kettle to hold in heat.  After half an hour, check and adjust temperature as necessary by manipulating your stove setting.  After a few trial runs, you'll pretty much know what stove setting for what amount of time works to get the job done, and you won't have to babysit as much.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7015342</next>\n<prev>7015221</prev>\n<first>7015206</first>\n<last>7015342</last>\n<when>1181148509</when>\n<utime>06/06/07 07:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
