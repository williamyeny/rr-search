Lots of mountain backpackers have become very sick because they didn't boil their drinking water from the river for a full five minutes.  There's no endospores in karo, so no need for a pressure cooker, but you do need to boil it because there's bacteria floating in the air all around us. You might get lucky a time or two, but it's certainly not going to work every time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5680376</next>\n<prev>5680234</prev>\n<first>5659034</first>\n<last>13084206</last>\n<when>1148752604</when>\n<utime>05/27/06 08:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
