It is just useless as a short term buffer because it's not hydrated(water soluable).  Dolomitic lime is pelletized and slow acting.  It's intended to give long term buffering to outdoor flowerbeds and trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime from dolomitic limestone is also high in Mg, which has a negative effect on fruiting, but that's not going to be a problem indoors because it will never break down enough to release the Mg during the month or two crop cycle of a mushroom grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're using oyster shell flour, you're fine, but a bit of hydrated lime mixed in will work faster.  Hydrated lime is great for the immediate ph swing which will hold off contaminant spores from germinating while the mushroom mycelium colonizes the casing layer.  Not being able to find hydrated lime doesn't mean the project will fail by any means.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6163127</prev>\n<first>6162681</first>\n<last>6163156</last>\n<when>1160698155</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 03:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
