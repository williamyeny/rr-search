I'd recommend getting the foil off the jars though.  It's important to keep the filters dry, and the foil can encourage condensation that gets them wet.<br />Simply cutting slits or holes in the greenhouse should take care of FAE for you.  If that's a wicking type humidifier, it probably won't keep up.  I can't tell from the pic if it's that or an ultrasonic.  most of us are using impeller type cool mists now, as they work very well.  Once again, good luck on the grow!<br />RR"}}
