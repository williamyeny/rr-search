You need holes in the bottom for the water to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should pasteurize straw.  Boiling will sterilize it, which leaves it open for contaminants because there is no competitors such as survive with pasteurization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often leave verm untreated, but if a bag has been open for a long time, I'll stick it in the oven as said above for awhile before using it for dunk and roll or similar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6676437</next>\n<prev>6676390</prev>\n<first>6531759</first>\n<last>6676478</last>\n<when>1174065247</when>\n<utime>03/16/07 08:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
