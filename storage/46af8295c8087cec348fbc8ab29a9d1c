Normal room temperature is what I recommend for colonizing jars because heat stimulates bacteria and molds as much or more than it stimulates mushroom mycelium.<br />Any temperature from about 74F to 80F is fine for colonization, which is easy to obtain on an open shelf, such as the top shelf of a closet where it's raised up higher in the room where the temp is a bit warmer than down low.   I haven't used an 'incubator' in many years.<br />RR"}}
