So i'm looking for a good ( and cheap ) automated system.&lt;br /&gt;Got any good ideas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This indicates you don't understand mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; You need to figure out the life cycle of mushrooms before you try to design what isn't going to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms require fresh, dry, air exchange to cause evaporation from the substrate.&amp;nbsp; This evaporation is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; You then must mist to replace this moisture.&amp;nbsp; If you run a cool mist or anything else and get a steady-state humidity, performance will be poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best place to hide a grow is in plain sight.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19457805</next>\n<prev>19457632</prev>\n<first>19456640</first>\n<last>19461596</last>\n<when>1390424147</when>\n<utime>01/22/14 10:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
