Metal lids rust out, and then you have to buy more SFDs, which aren't cheap. If you use them whole, you can just replace the lid and keep using the filter pretty much forever. I'm in this situation myself right now, and I'm gonna have to buy about 100 new SFDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree to use the whole filter disk without cutting, but you certainly don't have to replace metal lids when they rust, nor do you replace the filter disks when they get rust stains on them. Some of my filter disks are disgustingly stained, including rust stains, but still work perfectly.&amp;nbsp; Simply wipe rusty lids and rings with a green scouring pad and keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic lids tend to break easily, and I've also had several pop off when shaking jars, spilling grains all over the place.&amp;nbsp; In addition, you'll get better gas exchange by having a few small holes in the lid, but using the entire surface of the filter disk rather than a small section, which I think is what you said. I just wanted to clarify that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18891371</next>\n<prev>18891286</prev>\n<first>18890341</first>\n<last>18894053</last>\n<when>1380166878</when>\n<utime>09/26/13 06:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
