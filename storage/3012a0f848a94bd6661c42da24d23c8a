Are you aware that a 1/4\" hole has 16 times the area of a 1/16\" hole?<br />Invitro pinning is caused by two main things.  First is low CO2 levels.  Second is a substrate that is losing moisture.  When those two conditions have been met, exposure to light comes in a distant third, but cubes will pin even without light, or light at very low levels.  Good luck in your growing.<br />RR"}}
