The other active ingredient is only 1/10th of 1%.  It will kill spores if it contacts them.  It's a surface disinfectant, but 70% alcohol is much cheaper, and just as effective for surfaces such as tabletops.  I use lysol to spray the surface of my flowhood a minute before starting it up.  This helps to kill of the buggars that have landed there since the last use so they don't get blown into my work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6664597</next>\n<prev>6664319</prev>\n<first>6663904</first>\n<last>6664767</last>\n<when>1173807343</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 08:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
