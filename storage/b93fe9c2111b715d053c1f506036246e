As creamcorn said, up your air exchange after each misting so the pins don't sit there wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you mist with large drops or a forceful spray, and then leave them wet, they'll abort.  If you get behind the curve and your casing layer is drying out, it's best to rehydrate it by spraying between the pins so you can get more water into the casing layer without damaging the fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5892492</prev>\n<first>5891821</first>\n<last>5892494</last>\n<when>1153711717</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 06:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
