Of course, I have holes in the bottom of the terrarium for the water to escape.  If there has been a contaminant outbreak, I'll pour some water mixed with bleach on first, then let that sit for half an hour before turning on the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before any of the 'conserve water' people jump my ass, bear in mind I live where the more water we use, the less the rivers and reservoirs flood.  If you live in a desert with limited water supplies, simply bleach soak and rinse the perlite if contaminants were present.  Otherwise, simply rehydrate the perlite, drain well and use.  Perlite is a mineral that will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6719542</next>\n<prev>6719233</prev>\n<first>6719188</first>\n<last>6719696</last>\n<when>1175095346</when>\n<utime>03/28/07 06:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
