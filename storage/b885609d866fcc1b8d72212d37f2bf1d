First, I tried tape. Light gets in from the gap though. This time, I tried putting tin foil in the monotub first, but when I dumped the sub in there, it made a mess and I removed the foil. Now I guess I will try taping an inch or 2 higher than the sub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mistake is in thinking light is causing those side pins rather than the correct cause, which is the beneficial microclimate around the gaps in the edges between substrate and tray.&amp;nbsp; This is why the trash bag helps.&amp;nbsp; The substrate attaches to the bag and the bag remains attached as the substrate shrinks, eliminating that air gap.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16489213</next>\n<prev>16488975</prev>\n<first>16488509</first>\n<last>16491734</last>\n<when>1341580067</when>\n<utime>07/06/12 04:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
