Water is not the only factor in determining fruit size. Another major factor is substrate depth. What species is this anyway? (I'm assuming cubensis). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing doesn't really hold much moisture, it provides a micro climate for primordia growth. The water content should not be an issue on the first flush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but that is flat-out wrong.&amp;nbsp; I can't just let it slide.&amp;nbsp; I've worked for many years to overcome bad advice that was given out in the early days when mushrooms growing was not understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER stop misting.&amp;nbsp; Growing mushrooms require moisture AND fresh air.&amp;nbsp; If you're providing the proper amount of fresh air, your fruits and your substrate will dry out.&amp;nbsp; This leads to small fruits.&amp;nbsp; You MUST mist from the pin stage all the way to mature fruits if you want a proper flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing doesn't really hold much moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, incorrect.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of a casing layer(when used) is to hold moisture to support the flush.&amp;nbsp; By misting, or even pouring water directly on the casing layer surface, the mycelium that has partially colonized the casing can absorb this moisture and carry it to the substrate, where it can help the developing mushrooms to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason deeper substrates support larger flushes and fruits is because larger substrates hold more moisture.&amp;nbsp; If you give proper moisture control to small substrates, they will perform well too.&amp;nbsp; It's all about water, as can be seen by the picture below of very large mushrooms on a very small substrate.&amp;nbsp; It's all about misting and fresh air, from initiation through harvest.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-004/238886677-jar_culture.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/09-004/238886677-thumb_jar_culture.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10093049</next>\n<prev>10092900</prev>\n<first>10092251</first>\n<last>10096728</last>\n<when>1238684888</when>\n<utime>04/02/09 06:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
