I've used tap water for many years in different parts of the world.  It's fine. You also don't need to clean it with bleach once a week.  When it starts to get nasty, clean it in the sink with soap and water.  Impeller type humidifiers DO move air, but not much.  They are the type to use for mycology.  You don't need one for a monotub or terrarium, but when you move up to a mini-greenhouse, you'll want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicking type humidifiers will work fine in the room your grow is located in, as a way to boost the ambient humidity, but they can't produce enough humidity for mushrooms.  After about 60% to 70%, they won't evaporate any more moisture into the air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7330129</next>\n<prev>7326285</prev>\n<first>7326226</first>\n<last>7330565</last>\n<when>1187907705</when>\n<utime>08/24/07 01:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
