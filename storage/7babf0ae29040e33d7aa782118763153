Then take that new print and then create a new series of isolates.&nbsp; Pick the best one (2nd generation).&nbsp; Fruit it.&nbsp; Take a print from the new isolate.&nbsp; Do isolates again from that print.&nbsp; Find the best one (3rd generation) So on and so on.&nbsp; Would the resulting print say from the 20th generation have a narrow set of genetics prone to certain characteristics you had been selecting for than the original print from which the first isolate was taken? </blockquote><br />Yes.<br />RR"}}
