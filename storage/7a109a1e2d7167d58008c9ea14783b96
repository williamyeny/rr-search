You can use a second casing layer on the dish below the cake for what's known as 'double end casing'.  Good luck.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3848289</next>\n<prev>3847984</prev>\n<first>3847958</first>\n<last>3848289</last>\n<when>1109636236</when>\n<utime>03/01/05 02:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
