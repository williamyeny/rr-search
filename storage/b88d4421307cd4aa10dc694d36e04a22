Also I believe they'll rot which isn't good so I pick them as I see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting at the base is correct when harvesting, but aborts don't rot nor do they use or waste energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripping large chunks of substrate when one harvests is just dumb because new pins won't form in the divot.&amp;nbsp; Thus, you ruin that part of your fruiting surface for future flushes.&amp;nbsp; It isn't primarily about contamination, although molds sometimes do colonize the damaged substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom stumps do not rot.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19573627</next>\n<prev>19573588</prev>\n<first>19571917</first>\n<last>19577098</last>\n<when>1392557659</when>\n<utime>02/16/14 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
