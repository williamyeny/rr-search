You'll be left with many strains in the same substrate because not all are compatible enough to combine into a single organism by anastomosis.  Therefore, each 'strain' will have a small piece of the substrate rather than being a single organism in control of the whole substrate, which is better for performance.  That's why we practice strain isolation on agar prior to inoculating our grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7129212</next>\n<prev>7129146</prev>\n<first>7129083</first>\n<last>7129212</last>\n<when>1183587464</when>\n<utime>07/05/07 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
