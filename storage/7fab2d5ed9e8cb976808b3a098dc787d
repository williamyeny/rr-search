Then put it in a sprayer and you can use it full strength right out of the bottle.  Mycelium doesn't like peroxide, but will recover from it.  Cobweb mold will literally disappear before your eyes when sprayed with H2O2. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>1471572</prev>\n<first>1465819</first>\n<last>1471934</last>\n<when>1050728002</when>\n<utime>04/19/03 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
