Mushrooms strains don't 'compete' with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as said above, an isoate is an isolate.  It will be one organism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have several strains active in a jar of grains, most will combine into a single organism via the process of &lt;i&gt;anastomosis&lt;/i&gt;.(Google it)  The others will fruit as separate strains, but won't be 'competing for nutes' as we hear the noobs constantly saying.  In fact, I've shot several strains deliberately into a single jar to watch what happens.  Most combine, but now and then you get a substrate with obviously different genetics in the fruiting bodies.  For example, you might have several large solo mushrooms, while the rest of the substrate is covered with smaller fruits coming from clusters.  Usually however, the difference between strains is so minimal that you'll never notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaking the jar won't cause the non-compatible strains to join forces.  The similar mycelium will re-connect with like mycelium.  The entire concept of 'strain' in the OMC is vastly overrated.  It's nothing like in mj, where the strain determines everything.  Remember, fungi are not plants.  Perhaps an analogy, since most 'strains' seem to be named for where they were collected is to consider a man from Chicago (Chicago strain), getting married to a woman from New York (New York strain).  The genes from the two strains combine, rather than fight.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8455813</next>\n<prev>8455310</prev>\n<first>8454345</first>\n<last>8455893</last>\n<when>1212003045</when>\n<utime>05/28/08 10:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
