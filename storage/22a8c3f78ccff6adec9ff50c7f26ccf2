There are thousands of mold species floating around in the air and nobody can make a positive ID from a picture.  However, if you properly sterilized the substrate, and have the top of the jar filtered with either dry vermiculite or tyvek, the molds were introduced by improper sterile technique later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest burying the contents of those jars outside, or re-sterilizing before you open the jar to clean out the contents.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7655470</next>\n<prev>7652940</prev>\n<first>7650347</first>\n<last>7655470</last>\n<when>1195499111</when>\n<utime>11/19/07 09:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
