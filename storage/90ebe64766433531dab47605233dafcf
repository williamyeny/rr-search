All of the experienced growers here have posted their teks on this over and over and over again until we're all tired of typing it.  I run the coolmist inside the greenhouse and have grown hundreds, if not thousands of pounds of mushrooms that way.  Others, such as hippie chic pipe in the humidifier and are successful too.  We've all figured out how to get proper air exchange and maintain correct humidity.  There's no single 'one way' to do it as we've all proved by doing it differently, yet being successful, and our methods have been posted repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6674885</prev>\n<first>6667546</first>\n<last>6674964</last>\n<when>1174019597</when>\n<utime>03/16/07 07:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
