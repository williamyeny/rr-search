I just find this interesting. Could you elaborate? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google it and you'll get more, but to start, mushroom mycelium consumes oxygen and releases the carbon in its food as CO2, just like humans. Plants do the opposite. Mushroom mycelium produces heat as it metabolizes its food, just like humans.  Plants get energy from the sun, but mushroom mycelium gets energy from its food source, just like humans.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7829376</next>\n<prev>7829249</prev>\n<first>7825263</first>\n<last>7833465</last>\n<when>1199415753</when>\n<utime>01/04/08 05:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
