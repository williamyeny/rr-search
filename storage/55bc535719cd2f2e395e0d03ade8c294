If you live in the desert, you'll of course need to mist more often than someone that lives in a damp climate. However, even in Seattle, I used to mist a few times daily.  If it's extremely dry in your house, run a coolmist humidifier in the room the fruiting chamber is located.  If you get the ambient room humidity up to 50% or so, this design will perform perfectly.<br />RR"}}
