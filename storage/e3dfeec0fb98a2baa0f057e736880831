We toss out contaminated projects to protect our own future projects because we're trying to grow in a sterile or semi-sterile environment, but nothing is wrong with the fruits if they form.  I know of no contaminants common to mushroom culture that are harmful to healthy people, except bacteria which will cause food poisoning.  Therefore, don't eat any slimy, rotten mushrooms.  A mushroom from a cake with a bit of mold is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5968928</prev>\n<first>5968789</first>\n<last>5971540</last>\n<when>1155791084</when>\n<utime>08/17/06 08:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
