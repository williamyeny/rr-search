I will ONLY accept that -some- light leads to shrooms, as that is the convention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds, if not thousands of members here have made the switch to 6500K fluorescent and LED lighting and to a person, they've reported larger fruits and more of them than before.&amp;nbsp; I prove this on a daily basis in my mushroom farm, where my living depends on getting the most product per square foot at the lowest cost.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even see the difference between the substrate blocks near the isles where light is brighter and the ones behind them which get shaded and reflected light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No light at all vs 24/7 light would be hard to determine which is worse.&amp;nbsp; Use 12/12 light.&amp;nbsp; Most mushroom growth occurs during the period of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone is free to disagree. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13698841</next>\n<prev>13698557</prev>\n<first>13684454</first>\n<last>13720036</last>\n<when>1293603241</when>\n<utime>12/29/10 08:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
