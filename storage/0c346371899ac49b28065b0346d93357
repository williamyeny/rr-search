I relized today that my perlite is dry...</blockquote><br />If your perlite is dry, it indicates you're not misting the cakes enough because the overspray also rehydrates the perlite. I'd suggest to remove the cakes and place the tub where you can run water through it such as the shower.&nbsp; Wet the perlite well and allow it to drain, fluffing the perlite by raking your fingers through it so it's loose and airy.&nbsp; Dunk the cakes for 12 hours and roll in fresh verm.<br />Place the cakes in direct sunlight for a few minutes each day until you see pins.&nbsp; You should be misting a few times daily.<br />RR"}}
