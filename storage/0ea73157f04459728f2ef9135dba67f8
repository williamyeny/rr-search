{"key":"post-6253006","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6253006</id>\n<content>I stickied this post because we needed a good cobweb mold picture for people to see what it looks like.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobweb mold is in the air everywhere and it spreads by mycelial fragments that float on air currents rather than spores.  That is why it can take over a project so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Wronguy hinted at, air exchange is the key.  If you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; choose to incubate your casing layer under foil for a few days, be sure to do so at room temperature.  Lower temperatures favor mushroom mycelium, and higher temperatures favor molds such as cobweb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other point I want to emphasize is that peroxide will melt cobweb mold on contact.  When you see it, spray the entire casing layer down with peroxide, even the areas you don't see the mold because fragments of cobweb will be all over the entire layer.  The peroxide is not good at all for your mushroom mycelium, but it's death on contact to Dactylium mycelium, so use it when needed, but never as a preventative.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6259754</next>\n<prev>6250911</prev>\n<first>6247726</first>\n<last>6283684</last>\n<when>1162833651</when>\n<utime>11/06/06 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
