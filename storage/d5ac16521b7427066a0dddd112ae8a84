I've marked a few jars with a marker at the myc line and nothing has budged. Its like after the first few centimeters they just stopped. Still no contaminates, still good looking moister level, the mycelium just isn't spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss it all into the trash, order fresh spores and start over.&amp;nbsp; That grow is hosed.&amp;nbsp; Properly made and inoculated brf cakes should be fully colonized in three weeks.&amp;nbsp; If they're slow, allow 4 weeks, but no more.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12684256</prev>\n<first>12474588</first>\n<last>12684338</last>\n<when>1275672636</when>\n<utime>06/04/10 08:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
