You never case with a substrate material.  You want to spawn your grains or brf cakes into your substrate, which would be straw, coir, manure, etc.  Consider 3&quot; to 4&quot; the maximum depth.  Beyond that, things get iffy real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing is the non-nutritious top layer you put on after the substrate has become colonized with mushroom mycelium.  Consider 1&quot; the maximum depth of casing, but 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; is probably better yet.  I rarely use over 1/2&quot; of casing, even with deep substrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other species of interest to people here require a thin substrate and casing layer.  For example, Pan cyans rarely fruit from a substrate over 1 1/2&quot; thick.  If you're growing those, keep your manure layer thin, and apply a very thin casing layer, such as 1/4&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6977669</prev>\n<first>6977570</first>\n<last>6977869</last>\n<when>1180380900</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 10:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
