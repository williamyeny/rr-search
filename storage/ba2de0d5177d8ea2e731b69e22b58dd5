I prefer rye berries for sclerotia over rye grass seed, which was recommended by stamets in TMC.  I regularly get between 1/2 and 2/3 of a quart of actual sclerotia from each quart of rye berries.  I get nowhere near those results when using rye grass seed.  However, either will work as spawn.  Several years ago, I used nothing but rye grass seed and had great results as both spawn and for grain to grain transfers.  It works fine, but is a bit harder to get the moisture content exact, and they don't shake up as easily as rye berries, but both work as either spawn or for producing sclerotia.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8068022</next>\n<prev>8067931</prev>\n<first>1498820</first>\n<last>12148335</last>\n<when>1203956119</when>\n<utime>02/25/08 06:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
