You want the caps nice and dry so they won't mold or harbor bacteria during printing.  It doesn't matter if a few trich spores are on the mushroom cap because it's going to puke out a billion or so spores, and chances are, any spores that have landed on it will stay there.  If you're worried, you can always lay the cap on a piece of hardware cloth and let the spores fall through that to your printing surface.  I really like using a tyvek sheet over the caps as they print.  It allows air exchange and at the same time protects the area from contaminants as the print is making.  A one square yard sheet will cover a whole lot of printing caps.  You can get kite grade tyvek at <a href=\"http://www.intothewind.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.intothewind.com</a>  In my opinion, it's far superior to the post office tyvek.  It's thicker too.<br />RR"}}
