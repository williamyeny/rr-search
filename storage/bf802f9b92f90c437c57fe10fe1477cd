The foil could keep the filter material damp.<br />My method is metal lid goes on first, metal side down instead of rubber side down so it's easier to get off later, then the filter disk, then the ring.  <br />Three 1/16\" holes are plenty.  You don't need air exchange with grain jars, you only require gas exchange.<br />RR"}}
