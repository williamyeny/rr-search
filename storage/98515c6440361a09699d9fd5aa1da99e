Stealth and ease would be the two main reasons.  If you work a lot of hours at your job, you probably don't have time to come home and spend hours working on a hobby.  With invitro, once the spawn is inoculated, just sit back and wait for effortless fruits. They dig out with a fork easily, then the jar is filled up with water and put in the refrigerator for 24 hours, then drained, and the process repeated.  The fruits are small and deformed, but a bag of small, deformed, dry fruits look almost just like a bag of big beautiful dry fruits.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2201851</next>\n<prev>2200932</prev>\n<first>2200294</first>\n<last>2202066</last>\n<when>1072404333</when>\n<utime>12/26/03 04:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
