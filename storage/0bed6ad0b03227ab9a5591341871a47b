We don't attempt to mimic nature in our indoor grows, or we'd have to inoculate dozens of molds and countless bacteria along with our mushroom spores.  In addition, I've never seen wild shiitake or oysters growing on sawdust that's been supplemented with wheat bran and gypsum, but it sure as heck works when we grow indoors. I agree that horse manure is somewhat better, but I've had many coir grows side by side with manure, and found little difference, other than manure does tend to give an extra flush or two.<br />RR"}}
