The only reason for cold water is to inhibit bacterial growth during the time your substrate is underwater.  If you use running water, just let it gently overfill the jar and run over the edges for 6 to 12 hours.  70 to 80F is better for your fruiting environment.  90F is too high for anything we do in mycology.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5435067</prev>\n<first>5435048</first>\n<last>5435298</last>\n<when>1143160278</when>\n<utime>03/24/06 02:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
