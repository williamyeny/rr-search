Bulk substrates by definition are 'bulk' meaning a large tray is filled up with them, and they're kept in a non-sterile environment.  Therefore, when bulk growing, manure and/or other bulk substrates should be pasteurized.  When using spawn bags or jars to grow the whole crop, there is nothing wrong with sterilization because the outside air never touches the substrate.  Such however, is not actually a 'bulk substrate' since spawn bags rarely hold more than 5 to 7 pounds, while a tray of manure or straw might easily weigh 50 or more pounds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7337935</next>\n<prev>7336602</prev>\n<first>7334795</first>\n<last>7340685</last>\n<when>1188162473</when>\n<utime>08/27/07 12:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
