If so, bacteria and molds can colonize right through it.  It's a mistake to think the inside of the PC stays sterile after it cools.  If it were my jars, I'd toss them out and make a fresh batch.  The possible wasted time and materials on a failure costs more than simply replacing the contents of the jars now.<br />RR"}}
