Thanks man!</blockquote><br />No,&nbsp; the mushrooms did fine.&nbsp; It just gave my wonderful wife terminal cancer.&nbsp; She's just been sent home from the hospital to die because there's nothing they can do for her.&nbsp; Get out of that house or apartment now and don't ever enter it again.&nbsp; Black mold is deadly to humans and bleach doesn't kill it, nor does replacing the sheetrock.&nbsp; It's in the framing timbers and will be until the building is burned down, which is what local codes should require.<br />RR"}}
