If you're saying you can't put the manure in a bag and walk to the nearest roof, vacant lot, landscaped area, or fence line, then just do the pf tek and forget using manure.  I live in a high-rise condo in a major city and use manure, straw, compost, etc., all the time so I have little sympathy for those who don't wish to put out the effort. It's not that hard to find a place in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6369409</next>\n<prev>6369353</prev>\n<first>6369299</first>\n<last>6372764</last>\n<when>1166107425</when>\n<utime>12/14/06 04:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
