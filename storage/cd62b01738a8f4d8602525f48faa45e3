I have way more doses than I need for personal consumption for a very long time.

That's when the mycelium junkie in us switches over to edibles and medicinals.  It opens up a whole new set of challenges because they're much more difficult to grow than cubes, so the learning curve turns up the heat again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6858103</next>\n<prev>6857799</prev>\n<first>6854456</first>\n<last>6971023</last>\n<when>1178040874</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 08:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
