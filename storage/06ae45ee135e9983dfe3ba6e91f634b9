There is no need for long term buffering because casings don't last long enough to need it.  Use hydrated lime and gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6103438</next>\n<prev>6101092</prev>\n<first>6100510</first>\n<last>6103438</last>\n<when>1159294449</when>\n<utime>09/26/06 09:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
