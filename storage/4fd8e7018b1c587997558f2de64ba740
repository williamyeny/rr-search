In addition, if the air inside your incubator is at 30C, the bottom of the aquarium where it's sitting on the heating pad is much hotter.  I suspect you have burned up/dried out your jars.  Never set an aquarium or anything else on a heating pad.  If you don't heat your house, you might try putting the heating pad &lt;i&gt;above&lt;/i&gt; the aquarium, but not below it which is not only a fire hazard, but cooks the substrate in your jars.  If you heat your house to normal room temperature, then just get rid of the incubator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I incubate at normal room temperature on an open shelf and my pf jars are fully colonized in two to two and a half weeks, even in winter, and I'm only 100 miles south of the Canadian border.  Personally, I think incubators cause more problems than they solve.  I recently left a batch of jars in my brothers unheated garage for a month after inoculation, and when I went to get them, they were fully colonized.  The temperature in his garage never went above 50F/10C during that entire time, so why mess with incubators?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6534280</next>\n<prev>6533967</prev>\n<first>6529738</first>\n<last>6534280</last>\n<when>1170723219</when>\n<utime>02/06/07 02:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
