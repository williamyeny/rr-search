The project in the above picture contaminated a day or two after it was taken.  It wasn't the mushrooms that contaminated(mexicana A), but the grass itself.  It got a bad case of powdery mildew.  Several growers here over the years have attempted to combine lizard tanks with mushrooms, with failure.  The lizard or other animal's waste is not condusive to healthy mycelium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you just use plants, your mushrooms want extremely high humidity, which most plants can't take with the exception of a very few such as venus fly traps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that does work is to dump your spent substrates/left over spawn into your houseplants along with a bit of unpasteurized manure.  You get surprises from time to time when you least expect them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5980469</next>\n<prev>5980397</prev>\n<first>5979260</first>\n<last>5980469</last>\n<when>1156052174</when>\n<utime>08/20/06 08:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
