It goes to work right away instead of needing time to break down.  Use the lime at the rate of 5% of the amount of peat by volume.  In other words, a cup of your hydrated lime for each 20 cups of peat.  Add gypsum at a ten percent rate.  Use 1/2 the amount of blood meal that you do lime.  Mix all the dry ingredients except the verm together well, then bring to field capacity.  Bring the verm to field capacity, then mix it in with the peat.  Pasteurize and use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5583178</next>\n<prev>5582436</prev>\n<first>5582415</first>\n<last>5584044</last>\n<when>1146623499</when>\n<utime>05/03/06 05:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
