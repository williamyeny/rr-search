Mycelium will metabolyze the aluminum and eat holes through it on the very first flush.  Since the foil is 'digested' by the mycelium, one must assume the metals end up in the fruitbodies.  Aluminum has been implicated in alzhimers disease and other health problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rot and 'mean green' are two different things.  Rot is caused by bacteria, and the 'mean green' is an imperfect fungi.  Fruits that grow on the sides or bottom of a tray will be just fine until after the top flush is complete.  At that point, flip the substrate over and pick the ones off the sides or bottom.  Replace and dunk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5190239</next>\n<prev>5189633</prev>\n<first>5187579</first>\n<last>5190822</last>\n<when>1137506504</when>\n<utime>01/17/06 04:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
