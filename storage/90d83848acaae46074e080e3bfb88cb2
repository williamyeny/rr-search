This ensures the urea and the especially toxic byproduct after bacteria get to it; ammonia, is evaporated off.&amp;nbsp; Your entire concept is based on a false premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we're not talking about direct exposure of mycelia to &quot;Urea&quot; or &quot;Ammonia&quot; now are we?&amp;nbsp; So your refutation is based on an inapplicable premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp; I'm not making that argument:&amp;nbsp; You did.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You said it's urea which gives manure it's nitrogen goodness and that's what chemical ferts are based on.&amp;nbsp; That is incorrect on both counts.&amp;nbsp; Now you are arguing that it's incorrect.&amp;nbsp; You're arguing against your own earlier point which I was refuting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You haven't proposed a theory for how bacteria consume a salt and make it available to fungi.&amp;nbsp; Why don't you think fungi can absorb it on its own?&amp;nbsp; Fungi can digest solid rock.&amp;nbsp; If it couldn't, we wouldn't see a benefit from gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19515265</next>\n<prev>19515225</prev>\n<first>19511982</first>\n<last>24817404</last>\n<when>1391449041</when>\n<utime>02/03/14 07:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
