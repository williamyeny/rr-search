Chanterelles in my area don't fruit until we've had a frost or near frost.  P cyans are another.  You find them in late fall when the temperatures are in the 30's and 40's, after a long summer of 80+ weather.  There's lots more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don't confuse those species with tropical species like cubes.  You can colonize cubes at 80, then move to a fruiting chamber at 85, and they'll go right to town, provided you properly juggle the many pinning triggers simultaneously.  Ditto for pans cyans.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5750260</next>\n<prev>5750123</prev>\n<first>5749426</first>\n<last>9042966</last>\n<when>1150322361</when>\n<utime>06/15/06 12:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
