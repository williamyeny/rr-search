Such an encounter, where two hyphal systems fuse, is known as anastomosis. When two incompatible colonies of mycelia meet, a zone of inhibited growth frequently forms. On agar media, this zone of incompatibility is visible to the unaided eye.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now correct me if I'm wrong but in &lt;b&gt;ANY&lt;/b&gt; multi spore inoculation &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are many different strains so this process will happen &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regardless if you mix different syringes or just use one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a certain extent, yes.  They may fuse, and they may remain separate and fruit separate.  When unlike mycelium are placed together on a petri dish, this can be observed.  As Paul said, a line of inhibited growth forms between the two strains.  This can be observed below.  Both of these growths originated from the same sporeprint, but were isolated down to single sector isolated strains.  These two isolates are not compatible, therefore a line of separation has formed between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-39/791856189-zone_of_inhibition_002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-39/791856189-thumb_zone_of_inhibition_002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-39/791852198-zone_of_inhibition_001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-39/791852198-thumb_zone_of_inhibition_001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other times, after the zone of isolation has formed, a distinct third growth will emerge from it. This third growth as shown below emerging from the 12 o'clock position is a hybrid of the two mycelium, and is usually more vigorous than either parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/576368248-cublandia_mycelium_001a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-16/576368248-thumb_cublandia_mycelium_001a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When spores germinate and then pair up with compatable hyphae to form multiple strains that then fuse by anastomosis, the results can be seen in the picture below.  The single sector at the bottom of the growth is steadly becoming more of the total as it assimilates the other strains into its network.  If allowed to grow, it might have consolidated the entire dish into one strain or it may have ran up against an incompatible strain as seen in the pics above and stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-18/530157237-sectored_dish.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/05-18/530157237-thumb_sectored_dish.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding a petri dish up to light and looking at it from the agar side is a good way to see the line of inihibition between the strains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5545852</next>\n<prev>5544969</prev>\n<first>5543678</first>\n<last>24412989</last>\n<when>1145769011</when>\n<utime>04/23/06 08:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
