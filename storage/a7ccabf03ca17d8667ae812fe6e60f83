Few plants can tolerate the near 100% humidity in a terrarium.  Fewer still can thrive without growing powdery mildew(cobweb), and ruining your mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to molds that occur before first flush is better sterile procedure when inoculating.  For molds that occur after first flush, the answer is better and more frequent air exchanges in the FC, even if there is lots of mold spores within the air.  Given plenty of fresh air, molds don't have a chance against properly pasterurized casing material or fully colonized substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8470708</prev>\n<first>8470708</first>\n<last>8470795</last>\n<when>1212343749</when>\n<utime>06/01/08 09:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
