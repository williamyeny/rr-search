If you're growing mushrooms, use substrate materials.  Chicken manure at 5% is a great additive, as is coffee grinds at up to 50%, and steer manure at up to 50%.  If an animal eats grains or straw, its manure is fine to use.  Don't use ground up animal guts such as fish emulsion, or manure from carnivores such as bats, dogs and cats, etc.<br />RR"}}
