If it's there, you'll need to take an in-focus picture or point it out.  I see what appears to be bruising on fully colnonized substrate because it's blue.  If it turns the q-tip green, you'll know, but i doubt it will.   Trichoderma won't be the color of the substrate or casing, it will be a layer above it, as if you poured some green sand out on the top of the casing layer.<br />RR"}}
