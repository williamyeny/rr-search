With straw, ten to one works fine. You don't need to 'measure' the straw.  Just eyeball it and you'll be close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a straw log gets a small bit of green just as, or after it fully colonizes, you don't need to discard it because the mold will  be right on the surface.  Dip a q-tip in salt paste and carefully get the green spores off the straw log without stirring them up, then use a fresh q-tip dipped in salt paste to cover the whole area with salt, extending out 1cm - 1/2&quot; away from the visible part of the mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest cause of green molds with straw logs is allowing your grains to settle close to the edges, especially up against the plastic which you punch holes in.  Try to keep your spawn in the center 2/3 of the straw log, and have nothing but straw around the edges. It's taken me many years to figure that one out, even though it seems so obvious now.  You want to avoid the rye berries or wbs being against the edges at the left end of the log as you see in the picture below, taken the next day after spawning.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-40/018964020-oyster_straw_log_1a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-40/018964020-thumb_oyster_straw_log_1a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6330294</next>\n<prev>6330157</prev>\n<first>6330095</first>\n<last>22653268</last>\n<when>1165177281</when>\n<utime>12/03/06 10:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
