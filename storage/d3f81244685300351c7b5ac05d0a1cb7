Here's a petri dish fruiting.  There is probably less than 1/10 gram there.  30 of these petri dishes would give you a three gram dose for ten times the expense of a tray of compost that would give ten times as much.  Agar is for cleaning up your mycelium to use as spawn.  Rye grain is great as a spawn medium to expand your mycelium, and compost, straw or manure are excellent fruiting substrates.  For best results, build on the experience of those who came before you.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-01/302731395-petri_dish.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/04-01/302731395-thumb_petri_dish.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4176451</prev>\n<first>4175897</first>\n<last>4176567</last>\n<when>1116132165</when>\n<utime>05/15/05 07:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
