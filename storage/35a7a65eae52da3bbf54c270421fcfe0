{"key":"post-7800301","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7800301</id>\n<content>White rice, and white bleached wheat flour will give poor results.  This has been tried hundreds of times.  If you want to do it again, suit yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't a case of potency.  It's a case of not giving the mycelium what it wants to eat, thus the performance is poor.  Experimenting is good, but re-inventing the square wheel is not good.  I'd suggest using proved substrates, or look for better substrates, but not those that are already proved to be inferior.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7800402</next>\n<prev>7800283</prev>\n<first>7798581</first>\n<last>7806950</last>\n<when>1198680944</when>\n<utime>12/26/07 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
