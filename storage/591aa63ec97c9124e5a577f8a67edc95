{"key":"post-6835335","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6835335</id>\n<content>Everybody ends up inventing their own system after awhile and that's fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My system is to list the date first, parent species second, then strain third, and then each transfer beginning with the letter 'A' and going through the alphabet.   Assume the species is Reishi, and the strain is my 'sheriff'.(sherrif strain got its name because a dumbass sheriff gave me a bogus ticket the day I cloned it, but that's another story)   A swipe of spores made today on agar would be labeled 042607RS.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming three days from now I make a series of transfers of the first mycelium to germinate from spores, they would be labeled 042907RS A1, B1, C1, D1, etc.  As the strains differentiate, the next series of transfers would be labeled (date)RS-A1-A, (date)RS-A1-B, etc.  From the second original dish, the second set of transfers would be (date)RS-B1-A, (date)RS-B1-B, etc and right on down the list.  It's important to be consistant with your system all the way to fruiting because when you find that awesome fruiting strain three months from now, you want to be able to go back to the original dish in the refrigerator that corresponds to the fruiting tray, pull it out and make a master culture slant from it.  That way, you preserve the genetics of a great strain from a very early time in its life before many cell divisions have occured.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6835756</next>\n<prev>6834859</prev>\n<first>6834247</first>\n<last>6837969</last>\n<when>1177571659</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 10:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
