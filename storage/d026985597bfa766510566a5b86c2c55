I've been meaning to write it for a couple of years now, but haven't gotten around to it.  Hang on for another few weeks.  When I get my DVD stamped out, it has a complete strain isolation tek that goes from the original swipe of spores on agar, to the finished isolate.  I have an entire section on agar and how to work with it in addition to the strain isolation tek.   I just won't release it until it's totally right(by my hyper-anal standards), and there's still a few things I want to tweak.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6580203</next>\n<prev>6580034</prev>\n<first>6579834</first>\n<last>6580215</last>\n<when>1171780418</when>\n<utime>02/18/07 08:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
