{"key":"post-6707087","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6707087</id>\n<content>I've used untreated verm for a dunk and roll and had no problems.  Verm is a mineral so doesn't harbor endospores or other contaminants, and is produced a very high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if your bag has been open, anything could have landed on it.  Your substrate should be colonized prior to casing, so it should be fine as is, but it never hurts to stick it in the oven at 350F for half an hour.  Probably not necessary, but certainly not harmful.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6708854</next>\n<prev>6706737</prev>\n<first>6706737</first>\n<last>6708854</last>\n<when>1174778863</when>\n<utime>03/25/07 02:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
