Bear in mind, that's only a sample clip.&nbsp; The full grain prep tek is on the DVD. <br />When fully colonized, you can mix with pasteurized or sterilized and hydrated verm, or a mix of verm and coir, verm and horse or cow manure, or straw.&nbsp; Don't use chicken manure over about 5% of the total substrate if you use it as a supplement.<br />RR"}}
