The other 2 videos are running fine and look great.  I especially like the text below each part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting that on my satellite connection during prime time when things always slow down due to lots of folks online.  Cable is better for these because they're HUGE files, even in the low bitrate files DSL and Satellite users get fed.  Cable guys, especially if they're on fiber get resolution almost as good as the DVD itself. . .and they stream over the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've found several bugs, but the quality of the stream seems seems to be worth looking for fixes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8431143</next>\n<prev>8430363</prev>\n<first>8429590</first>\n<last>9551491</last>\n<when>1211432323</when>\n<utime>05/22/08 07:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
