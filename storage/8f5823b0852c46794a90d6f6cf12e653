In the US, they're &lt;i&gt;mosty&lt;/i&gt; south of I-20/30, and east of I-40.  That would be the south-east US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're looking to start an outdoor bed for the summer, they'll do fine all the way to the arctic.  Many folks have posted pictures of outdoor grows in Alaska and Northern Europe.  They just won't survive the winter, so you'll have to start a new bed next year.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8419802</prev>\n<first>8418607</first>\n<last>8419941</last>\n<when>1211222529</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 09:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
