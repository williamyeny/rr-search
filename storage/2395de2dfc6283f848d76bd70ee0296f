There is no airflow in a glovebox. If you doubt this, light a cigarette lighter inside and watch the flame go straight up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you set up fruiting chambers, leave the window open for fresh air.&amp;nbsp; You have no need to filter the air from outside during fruiting.&amp;nbsp; Fresh air is the number one pinning trigger and also the number one contamination prevention, even if that outside air is full of mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also don't need an incubator.&amp;nbsp; Colonize your substrates/jars at normal room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12716713</prev>\n<first>12715942</first>\n<last>12716830</last>\n<when>1276133646</when>\n<utime>06/10/10 04:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
