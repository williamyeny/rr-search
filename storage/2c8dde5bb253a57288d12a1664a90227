If you don't plan on casing it, you should wait for full colonization.  If you're going to case, you can apply it anything after about 90% colonization.  A substrate covererd well with foil should not dry out in two weeks of colonziation.  The foil catches the moisture that leaves the substrate due to the internal heat produced, and it then usually runs back down the sides, replenishing the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6897026</next>\n<prev>6896792</prev>\n<first>6896792</first>\n<last>6897152</last>\n<when>1178808042</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
