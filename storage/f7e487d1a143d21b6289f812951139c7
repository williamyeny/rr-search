Nobody uses bubbler wands any more, they don't work well.&amp;nbsp; Perlite alone will give 99% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you put a coffee filter under your cakes, the mycelium will grow into it, and then into the perlite below.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to put FOIL under the cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I haven't used desiccants in many years.&amp;nbsp; Simply fan dry mushrooms without heat.&amp;nbsp; Some people use them, but not necessary in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Polyester above or below the perlite, and for what purpose?&amp;nbsp; Water should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be added to perlite.&amp;nbsp; Any standing water in perlite will LOWER humidity by rendering any perlite below water level useless.&amp;nbsp; Water is also a breeding ground for contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. We've long recommended fan drying with the mushrooms on paper towels or newspaper, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE COMMENTS ONLY APPLY TO THE METHOD OF BULK CASING USING PLASTIC TERRARIUMS USING THE REVERSE HYDROPONIC TECHNIQUE OF BUBBLING AIR THROUGH STERILIZED WATER THROUGH A BED OF PERLITE, THUS RESULTING IN AUTOMATED PRODUCTION WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF DAILY SPRAYING OR THE MANUAL REMOVAL OF CARBON DIOXIDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This idea has been around for many years, but it's been dropped in favor of much more effective growing methods.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps you're not aware that fresh air exchange, which causes evaporation of moisture from the substrate is the number ONE pinning trigger?&amp;nbsp; Aquarium pumps and bubbler wands will not deliver the amount of fresh air required for best performance of brf cakes, and certainly not enough for a bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term you invented of 'reverse hydroponics' has nothing to do with what you're proposing, which is to forget everything we've learned over the last decade.&amp;nbsp; Have you scrolled through the logs and seen the tremendous performance people are getting from their projects today, compared to what they were getting several years ago?&amp;nbsp; Check it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14477445</next>\n<prev>14476503</prev>\n<first>14476198</first>\n<last>14507251</last>\n<when>1305809650</when>\n<utime>05/19/11 03:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
