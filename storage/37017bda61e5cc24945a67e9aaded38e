Rye berries and rye grain are two names for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe I give for rye grass seed is as PitcherCrab stated.  Use twice as much seed by volume as water or water/coffee.  That recipe is for a quart jar.  If using liter jars, use 300 ml of grass seed and 150 ml of water or weak coffee.   The reason I only fill the jars a bit over half full is because the seeds are so light, they can be a real bitch to shake the jars if they're too full.  You'll see what I mean when you go to shake them later.  By leaving plenty of room in the jars, they'll break up easier when you bang them against a tire later on.  They'll also fluff up and fill 2/3 or so of the jar by full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7126499</next>\n<prev>7126282</prev>\n<first>7120623</first>\n<last>7128525</last>\n<when>1183519885</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 06:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
