It means the bacterial endospores have germinated, so they'll be easily killed by the PC.  I always boil for five minutes in the water the grains soaked in to kill the live bacteria before dumping down the sink.  I don't want all that live bacteria going into the P-trap below my sink and thriving.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3851146</next>\n<prev>3851052</prev>\n<first>3849654</first>\n<last>3855333</last>\n<when>1109692771</when>\n<utime>03/01/05 05:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
