Mushroom mycelium prefers a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 so the coffee helps a lot.  Don't add lime to balance the pH, because that defeats the purpose.  Use gypsum to add calcium and sulphur which are both essential mushroom nutrients, and also to help avoid clumping, but the gypsum isn't used as a pH buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low pH doesn't cause contamination in rye jars because the jars are sterilized and filtered.   We add lime to casing material because it's exposed to contaminant spores for an extended time.  The mushroom mycelium can tolerate a higher pH than molds can, so that's the reason we lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7058131</next>\n<prev>7057956</prev>\n<first>7054463</first>\n<last>7086965</last>\n<when>1182124979</when>\n<utime>06/18/07 03:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
