Sometimes you have to just sit back and be a spectator in this hobby.  It's hard as hell too...lol.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum is a mixture of calcium and sulphur.  Sheetrock is made from gypsum, and the supplier I get my garden gypsum from obviously sweeps the floor in the sheetrock plant.  It's full of white, grey and green paper from the drywall making process.  Some consider it optional, but I use it every time in manure, casing material, and even grain spawn.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5436026</next>\n<prev>5435805</prev>\n<first>5435749</first>\n<last>5452999</last>\n<when>1143171197</when>\n<utime>03/24/06 05:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
