Always increase air exchange after misting until the visible moisture has evaporated or soaked into the fruits. You can leave the lid loose or on at an angle for an hour to accomplish this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, after birthing, do a dunk and roll.  That makes vermiculite stick to the surface of the cake, giving uncolonized verm for you to mist, which then acts as a water reservoir slowly feeding the moisture to the cake as needed between mistings.  You'll see a performance boost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6973615</next>\n<prev>6973516</prev>\n<first>6972535</first>\n<last>6973860</last>\n<when>1180290638</when>\n<utime>05/27/07 09:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
