There is no need for sterile water unless your tap water is badly polluted.  I use tap water.  I also use tap water to prepare substrates.  Cakes and/or other substrates are not sterile, so assume they are covered with mold spores and bacteria, as are all living organisms.  The refrigerator helps to prevent these from germinating while the cake is underwater and unable to fend for itself.  It isn't cold shocking.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6204346</next>\n<prev>6204137</prev>\n<first>6203102</first>\n<last>6204538</last>\n<when>1161662523</when>\n<utime>10/24/06 07:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
