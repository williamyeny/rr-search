That way, the amp draw lowers on your motor...and you don't have excess restriction on your fan, you simply just decrease its blowing capacity until it suits your needs which will eliminate the need to break any silicone seal on your flowhood and make adjusting flow a snap by just opening or closing your intake. *Thanks Peter for that, I just wanted to add an explanation as to why*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the help anyhow guys &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/grin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:grin:&quot; title=&quot;:grin:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe with a quick search you'll find I've posted exactly that at least a hundred times, probably more.&amp;nbsp; The speed of an AC motor is controlled by the frequency of the supply, not the voltage. I just tire of typing the same things over and over and over again. You block the intake to reduce flow.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9733899</next>\n<prev>9733299</prev>\n<first>9729469</first>\n<last>9733899</last>\n<when>1233770895</when>\n<utime>02/04/09 08:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
