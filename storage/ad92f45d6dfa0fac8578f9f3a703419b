First is to help hydrate it fully, but an extra reason is the partial sterilization it affords that helps to kill the bacterial endospores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak it for 24 to 36 hours in a large kettle, then bring to a boil.  After half an hour or so at a full boil, drain well and allow the surface of the popcorn to air dry from the steam escaping off it.  Your popcorn is ready to load into jars when it is twice its original size and completely dry on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I consider popcorn a poor choice of spawn material due to its large kernel size and high bacterial endospore count.  The large kernels mean there is much less mycelium in a given jar then the same size jar would have if you used a smaller grain, since the mycelium colonizes the surface.  Smaller grains=more total surface area.  The bacterial endospores are a real problem with popcorn, resulting in many failures, even after PC'ing for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6287020</next>\n<prev>6286181</prev>\n<first>6286020</first>\n<last>6287020</last>\n<when>1163624577</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 11:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
