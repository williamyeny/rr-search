That only adds an additional vector for contamination to enter.  By banging the fully colonized jar several times agaist a bicycle or car tire, or large phonebook, you can easily break it up so that every single kernel is separated from every other kernel.  You then simply pour and twist from the donor into the receiving jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, use narrow mouth jars for grains.  Anytime a jar is open, it is a vector for contamination to enter, whether or not one has a glovebox or flowhood, sprays with oust, etc.  A narrow mouth jar has a substantially smaller opening, thus less exposure to contaminants when open. Narrow mouth jars are also easier to pour accurately from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I'm no fan of LC unless one has ran the cultures through agar first to clean them up.  If you're going to do that, simply eberbach the petri dish into a liter of LC and let it stir for 7 days.  You'll get a thousand fold increase in mycelium and it won't have time to knit back together so it's super easy to fill syringes.  If you don't have that equipment, I still feel grain to grain transfers using small mouth jars are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5813477</next>\n<prev>5813193</prev>\n<first>5812951</first>\n<last>5816706</last>\n<when>1151888824</when>\n<utime>07/03/06 04:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
