(avoid it with 1/2 pints)&amp;nbsp; You can also use 1&quot; of perlite in the bottom of the PC, but it's kind of messy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't lay jars on their sides unless they're above other jars, such as in the AA-921, you can do 7 quart jars standing up, and 3 more laying down on top of those seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If water is getting in, it sounds like perhaps you forgot to cover the tops with foil during sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9112192</next>\n<prev>9112022</prev>\n<first>9111946</first>\n<last>9127281</last>\n<when>1224641472</when>\n<utime>10/22/08 05:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
