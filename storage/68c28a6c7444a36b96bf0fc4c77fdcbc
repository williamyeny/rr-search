Allow them to dry slightly, then mist lightly.  After a few grows, you'll be able to instantly tell when a project needs to be misted.  You don't want them to dry completely out, or get waterlogged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6172272</next>\n<prev>6171708</prev>\n<first>6171578</first>\n<last>6172272</last>\n<when>1160937652</when>\n<utime>10/15/06 09:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
