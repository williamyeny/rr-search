They'll colonize much faster that way.  Then, at full colonization, remove them and dunk.  If you dunk in the jars, they will only intake water until they're tight against the glass, and then stop absorbing.  That's why we dunk and roll after birthing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7138154</next>\n<prev>7138132</prev>\n<first>7138050</first>\n<last>7138154</last>\n<when>1183760332</when>\n<utime>07/07/07 01:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
