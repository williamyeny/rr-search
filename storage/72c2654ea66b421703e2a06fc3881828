There's a lot of debate over mixing the spawn vs layering.  I've done it both ways and prefer layering, but every now and then as you make the tray, gently shake it back and forth a little bit to mix the spawn into the manure.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7338165</next>\n<prev>7337935</prev>\n<first>7334795</first>\n<last>7340685</last>\n<when>1188186056</when>\n<utime>08/27/07 06:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
