Since the jar is fully colonized, you can open it up and drain the liquid out.  After that, bang it against a car or fully inflated bicycle tire to separate the kernels so you can pour them out.

If they smell like anything else, such as garbage, toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5756508</next>\n<prev>5756343</prev>\n<first>5756290</first>\n<last>5756508</last>\n<when>1150466541</when>\n<utime>06/16/06 05:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
