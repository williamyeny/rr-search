Even the 'related threads' link below shows how often this gets repeated.  The answer is easy to find in the search engine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strains of the same species do NOT compete for nutrients and they do NOT fight it out.  That's absolutely silly.  Do the genes of a lady from Florida and a man from Texas fight it out when they make a baby?  Of course not.  Squirt as many different strains into the same jar or substrate as you want.  It's no different than multispore inoculation from one print.  It's all the same species.  Everybody who's done it has reported the same results.  A normal flush that looks just like any multispore inoculated flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6712110</next>\n<prev>6711188</prev>\n<first>6710863</first>\n<last>6712721</last>\n<when>1174890839</when>\n<utime>03/26/07 09:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
