It doesn't matter if it's rye, birdseed, or popcorn.  Try a 24-48 hour soak in water at room temperature to germinate any bacterial endospores, followed by a 10-20 minute boil.  This should hydrate any grain except popcorn, which usually likes to boil for an hour. The size of the kernals tells when it's ready. Drain into a collander and allow to drain for a few minutes.  Now, this is important;  As the steaming hot grain sits in the collander, shake it up and around so the steam evaporates off the kernals.  It will only take a few minutes of this, and the kernals will be bone dry on the outside.  Load jars and PC for the regular amount of time.  For rye or popcorn, I use 2 hours, 20 minutes.  This seems to work everytime.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2201267</next>\n<prev>2201010</prev>\n<first>2201010</first>\n<last>2209537</last>\n<when>1072405025</when>\n<utime>12/26/03 04:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
