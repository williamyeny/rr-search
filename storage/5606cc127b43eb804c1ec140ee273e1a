Coir is a great substrate material though.  Too bad about the price.  For nitrogen, you can add blood meal to all substrate materials including horse manure, at the rate of one tablespoon to ten cups of substrate.  It really does make a difference in the quality of your crop after harvest.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5179393</next>\n<prev>5158952</prev>\n<first>5150228</first>\n<last>25081449</last>\n<when>1136851615</when>\n<utime>01/10/06 02:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
