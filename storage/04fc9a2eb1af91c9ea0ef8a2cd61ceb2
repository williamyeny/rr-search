You can't use a cork, and they have to be kept sterile, while allowing for gas exchange.  If you can find one with screw on lids, they'll work fine.  You just leave the lid a full turn loose to allow for gas exchange, and wrap with parafilm to keep contaminants out.<br />Here's some cooling after sterilization in front of the flowhood.  I use the weight from a PC to hold them at the right angle.  You can also see the piece of wood placed into each slant, which once the mycelium colonizes the wood, it will last in stasis for years.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/285547682-Test_Tube_rack_at_slant_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/285547682-thumb_Test_Tube_rack_at_slant_2a.jpg\"></a>"}}
