Drain your perlite well, then place 4 inches of it into the terrarium with zero standing water(which will be impossible with a dozen or two holes in the bottom) and NO dry perlite.  Watch your humidity go to 98% in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6613730</next>\n<prev>6612712</prev>\n<first>6600786</first>\n<last>6631761</last>\n<when>1172526883</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 11:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
