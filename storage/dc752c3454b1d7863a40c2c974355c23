You need a powdered lime so it will disolve and go to work right away. Limestone flour or oyster shell flour would work if you can't find hydrated lime. That stuff is intended to be put into garden soil in the fall so it can sit all winter and break down, so the soil will be neutralized by the following spring.  When the average life of a casing layer is thirty days, those large pellets won't even begin to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, the Mg content is way too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need hydrated garden lime.  Here's a label from a bag of hydrated lime so you can compare both the mesh size and Mg content.  Dolomitic lime is absolutely the wrong type.  The Hoffman's shown above is great.  I've used it for years.  You can get the Hoffman's hydrated lime at  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt; if it's not available in your area.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-29/352394956-hydrated_lime_label.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-29/352394956-thumb_hydrated_lime_label.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5925337</next>\n<prev>5925065</prev>\n<first>5925058</first>\n<last>5925447</last>\n<when>1154539015</when>\n<utime>08/02/06 08:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
