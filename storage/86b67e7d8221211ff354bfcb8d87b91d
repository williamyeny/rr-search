That was healthy mycelium you killed.  Cobweb mold is EXTREMELY rare in pf cakes.  Dactylium is a contaminant of casing layers, especially peat based. It's also grey, not white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd recommend washing them under the faucet, and then dunking for at least a few hours in plain water.  Perhaps that will help mitigate some of the damage the peroxide did.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6729788</next>\n<prev>6729277</prev>\n<first>6727671</first>\n<last>6824671</last>\n<when>1175302843</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
