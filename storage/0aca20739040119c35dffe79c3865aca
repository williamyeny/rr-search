The human body can not break down and digest raw mushrooms.  They must be cooked.  If you eat a raw mushroom, your stomach tries to digest it but can't, thus it triggers a 'non-food-item-in-the-stomach' reflex which makes you feel a need to puke.  That's a far cry from food poisoning, which really does make you sick.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7800928</next>\n<prev>7800615</prev>\n<first>7800443</first>\n<last>7805103</last>\n<when>1198700366</when>\n<utime>12/26/07 10:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
