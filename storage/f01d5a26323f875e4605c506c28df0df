If there was a bit of mold on the substrate and none on the fruitbodies, then they don't even need to be boiled.  If there is mold on the fruits themselves, I'd toss them out personally.  Also, penicillium is rare in mushroom culture.  If your mold was green and powdery, it was trichoderma.  Otherwise, the most likely cause of blue would be bruising.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5597945</prev>\n<first>5597783</first>\n<last>5597995</last>\n<when>1146950699</when>\n<utime>05/07/06 12:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
