{"key":"post-6205526","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6205526</id>\n<content>People need to make a distinction between growing plants and fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worm castings are an excellent substrate additive material, but not because of nitrogen content.  They are lower in nitrogen then either straw or horse manure, which are both lower in nitrogen than steer manure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood meal is high in nitrogen, but is totally unusable to fungi unless it is applied in the composting process, which most home mushroom growers do not do.  The use of blood meal added to manure or coir is a waste of resources and actually encourages algae to form on the surface of the substrate or casing layer, leading inexperienced growers to throw out a perfectly fine project thinking they have 'green mold'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicken manure is high in nitrogen, but once again it needs to be added at the composting stage.  However, composted chicken manure available in bags at nurseries is an excellent additive to manure or straw because it's already composted, therefore available to the fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fish emulsion, available at garden centers is also an excellent additive to manure or coir substrates because it has already been composted or otherwise broken down anaerobically at the processing facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum should be added to all substrates for the texture it helps to provide as well as the calcium and sulfur, both essential nutrients for mycelial metabolism.  An added benefit of gypsum is that it tends to hold Ph levels steady, preventing wild swings as the mycelium colonizes a substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir, worm castings, horse manure, chicken manure etc., are all acidic and should be buffered with lime to a starting Ph of around 8.  This high Ph favors mushroom mycelium which is tolerant of sweet substrates, but prevents germination of contaminant spores which favor sour substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6206118</next>\n<prev>6205387</prev>\n<first>6205296</first>\n<last>26347573</last>\n<when>1161705262</when>\n<utime>10/24/06 06:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
