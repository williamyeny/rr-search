{"key":"post-6742693","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6742693</id>\n<content>Provided your cakes were contaminant free when birthed, the most likely cause of trichoderma growing is lack of air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruising will be within the mycelium itself, while molds will appear as a separate layer on top.  They almost look like green sand sprinkled on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide in the perlite is a waste of peroxide.  Save the peroxide for when you have cobweb mold.  It's not effective against trich, and in fact nothing is.  That's why we recommend tossing out contaminated cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be scraping the vermiculite barrier off the cake when you birth.  When you take the cake out of the jar, rinse it well under the faucet to get rid of that verm.  It's the filter and the edge of it has been exposed to contamination during colonization.  You don't want that staying attached and going into your humid fruiting chamber.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6743350</next>\n<prev>6742552</prev>\n<first>6742552</first>\n<last>6743350</last>\n<when>1175635003</when>\n<utime>04/04/07 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
