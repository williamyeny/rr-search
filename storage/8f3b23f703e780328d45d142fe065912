Get that entire setup off the carpet.  90% of all contaminant spores in a room are within one foot of the floor, and it's much worse even than that with carpet.  Put your terrarium on a shelf or table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, for terrariums, you can't beat perlite humidification.  Two to three inches of damp, but not wet perlite will easily give you 99% humidity for three to four weeks, which is plenty of time needed for a crop cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get fresh air in and stale air out, simply leave the lid a bit crooked.  Natural circulation will take care of the rest, especially if you have a few random holes drilled into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6149634</prev>\n<first>6149593</first>\n<last>6149695</last>\n<when>1160413751</when>\n<utime>10/09/06 08:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
