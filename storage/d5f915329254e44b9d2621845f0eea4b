I put in a calibrated analog hygrometer so sure that its dropping to &amp;lt;75%. Is that ok? I have to sleep and go to work for 8hrs a day so wont be able to mist during those times and am afraid they'll dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's physically impossible unless you have a fan pointed at the terrarium.&amp;nbsp; I've never seen a shotgun terrarium drop below 90% RH and my ambient humidity is &amp;lt;10% all winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calibrate an analog hygrometer by the damp towel method, not salt.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20822600</next>\n<prev>20821867</prev>\n<first>20821311</first>\n<last>20822600</last>\n<when>1415712578</when>\n<utime>11/11/14 03:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
