I've posted a technique for using filter patch bags with a tyvek sleeve inserted into them.  Don't seal until after pcing.  They explode as the PC cools, when the large surface of the pc that is exposed to air cools faster than the interior of the bags which stays hot longer.  That pressure has to go somewhere.  My tyvek tek gives a way for the pressure to escape, and then when 0 psi is reached, the bag seals and the tyvek becomes a filter.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6838190</next>\n<prev>6835689</prev>\n<first>6835689</first>\n<last>6838190</last>\n<when>1177606273</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
