Some of the most dangerous molds are growing right in a damp house or basement.  They'll be black in color.<br />If you eat a rotten mushroom, the symptoms will be similar to food poisoning, because that's what it is. It's caused from bacteria from the rotting mushroom.  If there's a bit of green mold on a cake, but a fruit is ready to harvest, you can safely eat the fruit.  The mold will not contaminate the fruit itself unless it's actually growing on it.<br />RR"}}
