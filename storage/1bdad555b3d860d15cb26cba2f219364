When it's in my FC it reads between 80 and 85%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after misting, it's always at 100%, so any hygrometer which does not read 100% is crap.&amp;nbsp; You can't get good hygrometers any more, so I no longer suggest people throw away money on them.&amp;nbsp; If you've built your terrarium per the tek, then your humidity is fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15575068</next>\n<prev>15575030</prev>\n<first>15509764</first>\n<last>15578431</last>\n<when>1324943687</when>\n<utime>12/27/11 01:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
