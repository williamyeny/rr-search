It's what blue cheese salad dressing is full of, and is not toxic unless you're allergic to penicillin shots.  However, penicillium is normally a contaminant of agar and grain cultures, not casing or substrates.  I suspect bruising as well, but 'grow kit' doesn't tell us a darn thing about what kind of substrate you're using.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6980852</next>\n<prev>6977170</prev>\n<first>6976626</first>\n<last>15634080</last>\n<when>1180371120</when>\n<utime>05/28/07 07:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
