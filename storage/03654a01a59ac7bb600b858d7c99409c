It's also harder for the CO2 to escape the larger jars.  Personally, I don't use anything larger than quarts, even though I have five or six cases of half gallon jars in storage.  Try leaving the jars laying on their sides.  Next grow, I'd suggest quarts for grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the larger the container, the drier you make the grains.  You'll use about 20% less water(per measure of grain) with half gallons than you'd use with quarts.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7504409</next>\n<prev>7504189</prev>\n<first>7500079</first>\n<last>20038601</last>\n<when>1192021896</when>\n<utime>10/10/07 04:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
