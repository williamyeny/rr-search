Since the kernels are so much larger, there is less total surface area for the mycelium to colonize, thus less mycelium is generated per jar.  New growers often mistake this as 'faster colonization' when in fact a given sized jar only &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to colonize faster because far less mycelium is being produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one is going to use larger jars, or more jars, they can also do so with a smaller grain that will deliver far more mycelium per jar.  I know you're well aware of this, but I want to make sure the new folks don't get confused by the off-topic bantering going on.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question asked, and the thread title itself refers to wbs and wheat, not popcorn.  I'm going to delete the next off topic post in this thread about popcorn and issue an official warning.  No more thread jacking.
