The moisture to support the flush is in the coir, and the eventual casing layer you add, should you choose to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also no benefit to crumbling and casing pf cakes without spawning them to bulk.  It only delays the first crop and greatly increases chance of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6831384</next>\n<prev>6831355</prev>\n<first>6831116</first>\n<last>6832075</last>\n<when>1177516582</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 06:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
