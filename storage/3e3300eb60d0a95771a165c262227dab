You might also try 'raking' the perlite with your fingers to fluff it up.  If it gets packed down, it won't work right.  Fluff it up and that's probably all you need to do.  I've had perlite still damp after two months.  Peroxide and bleach are a waste on perlite.  Just use plain water.  You're not growing mushrooms on the perlite, it's only for humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>23975460</next>\n<prev>7232535</prev>\n<first>7231908</first>\n<last>23975460</last>\n<when>1185626783</when>\n<utime>07/28/07 03:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
