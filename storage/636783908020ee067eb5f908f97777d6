Also, if you put two or three layers of jars above the towel, it may not burn, but it will definitely scorch and stink like hell.  That's why I prefer just about anything but a towel.  Even the lid to a smaller pot turned upside down makes a nice shelf.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6943533</next>\n<prev>6943482</prev>\n<first>6943296</first>\n<last>6947913</last>\n<when>1179701258</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 01:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
