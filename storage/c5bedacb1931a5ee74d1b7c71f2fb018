You don't need more than an inch in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave the weight OFF the pc until steam has vented for ten minutes.  If yours has a rocker valve, leave the valve open.  It's important to vent the air out until the surfaces of the jars and the sides and lid of the pc itself have come up to temperature, then put the weight on or close the valve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still have problems, replace the burner on your stove.
