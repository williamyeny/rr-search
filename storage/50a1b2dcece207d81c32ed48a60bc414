It takes awhile usually to see any rhizomorphic mycelium. <br />If you'll rinse the heck out of your rye berries before you begin the soak or simmer, they won't clump up later.  Just put the dry grains in a kettle, fill with water and stir around, then drain out and repeat a few times until the water pours off clear.  You'll be amazed at how cloudy and dirty the first few washes will pour off.<br />I also make my jars a bit on the dry side.  I don't ever just case the straight rye, but use it for spawn so it really doesn't matter, and the jars are much easier to shake when a bit dry then when a bit wet. <br />RR"}}
