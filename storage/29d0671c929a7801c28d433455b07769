When in doubt, consider advice by members with the tag over those without.&amp;nbsp; Don't consider members without the tag to be idiots, but when there is directly conflicting info and one of the members has a TC tag, consider it more valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative is to use the 'search posts' feature at the top of every page, and then enter the username of the cultivator you want to get results from.&amp;nbsp; The search engine will then return relevant results from that person only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree there's a lot of crap to wade through.&amp;nbsp; Don't consider 'old' posts to be more accurate than new posts either.&amp;nbsp; Up until a couple of years ago, we constantly had members posting that if a cake has a spot of green mold, the mushrooms from it are toxic, which is total BS.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9523418</next>\n<prev>9523389</prev>\n<first>9523324</first>\n<last>9532818</last>\n<when>1230750087</when>\n<utime>12/31/08 09:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
