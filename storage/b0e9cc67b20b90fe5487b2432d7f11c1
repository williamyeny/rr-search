We also know that higher intensity light is more effective than lower intensity light.&amp;nbsp; However, its a basic cultivation related subject that has already been covered many, many times before. I've seen nothing new here, but simply a repeat of mostly discredited old information.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk is cheap, but experimentation isn't.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully, the original poster will learn to grow mushrooms, experiment, and one day will report his findings.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8794997</next>\n<prev>8794745</prev>\n<first>8776597</first>\n<last>8806216</last>\n<when>1219160551</when>\n<utime>08/19/08 06:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
