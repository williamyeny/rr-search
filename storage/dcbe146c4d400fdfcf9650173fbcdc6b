The word 'culture' implies live mycelium.  I'd suggest using syringes to inoculate pf jars rather than LC.  You only add an additional vector of contamination when you fist must inoculate the LC, then have to again transfer the LC to the grain/brf jar.  Take the LC out of the equation and you can later do grain to grain transfers with colonized spawn which is far less prone to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6424830</next>\n<prev>6424548</prev>\n<first>6418933</first>\n<last>6424830</last>\n<when>1167944426</when>\n<utime>01/04/07 11:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
