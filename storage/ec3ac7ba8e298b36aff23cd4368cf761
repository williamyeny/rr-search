{"key":"post-7773339","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7773339</id>\n<content>Moisture in a pf cake often drains to the bottom of the cake from gravity, thus pinning starts there.  In addition, right against the perlite is the most humid microclimate, thus it encourages pinning.  It's also the area that any perite will stick to the cake simply by geography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've added a bit of perlite to casing soil mixes with good results.  The perlite keeps the casing nice and fluffy and provides many air pockets which are conducive to fruiting.  I suppose the same could help on a cake.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps one of you could do a dunk and roll in the normal way with verm, and then follow it up with a perlite roll as an experiment.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7773358</next>\n<prev>7773328</prev>\n<first>7773302</first>\n<last>7776823</last>\n<when>1197999825</when>\n<utime>12/18/07 07:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
