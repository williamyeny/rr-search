Twist pull sort of motion. I know it leaves like impact craters on the sub but its better then having little nubs of mushrooms rotting away IMO. Nothing lasts forever esp not a sub. But i'm also not saying to tear it up like a monster truck in a junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the ten thousandth time, the mushroom stubs left behind by cutting off at the base DO NOT ROT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one wishes to damage his substrate by ripping out chunks when harvesting, go for it.&amp;nbsp; The rest of us will harvest clean mushrooms with no damage to the substrate, so it can continue fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14632753</next>\n<prev>14631513</prev>\n<first>14625519</first>\n<last>14635508</last>\n<when>1308404998</when>\n<utime>06/18/11 04:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
