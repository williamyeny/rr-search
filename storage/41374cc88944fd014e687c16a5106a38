{"key":"post-6951371","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6951371</id>\n<content>I still have my 1954 panhead with tank shift that I bought back in '72 for $500. At that time, you could get panheads super cheap because everybody though shovels were the shit. I put it in a '58 swingarm frame in the early 80's when my back/ass tired of the rigid. It's got over a quarter of a million miles on it since '72, and god only knows how many it had then. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6951407</next>\n<prev>6951330</prev>\n<first>6950605</first>\n<last>12843126</last>\n<when>1179852881</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 07:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
