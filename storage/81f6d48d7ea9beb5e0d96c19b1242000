Another poster said they are outdated. Should I just be concerning myself with cloning, agar work, and grain to grain transfers? Am I missing the whole point? I was considering building a magnetic stirrer, but if it's only use is for liquid culture I might as well not waste my time. Any help is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grain to grain transfers are far more secure than liquid culture because you can see and smell if something is wrong before you transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germinate spores on agar so you can isolate away from any contamination before you expand the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Again, you can't do this with lame-ass LC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spores will germinate and hyphae will expand much faster on agar than on LC, so any claims that LC is 'faster' is flat-out wrong.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium will also expand exponentially faster on grains than on LC, so again nobody with a modicum of experience can claim LC is faster in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MaJiK_420 said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I got that off my chest, HERES MY 2 CENTS. Take it for what its worth. I just started a liquid culture after coming across a few threads saying how you can make a big batch of LC that last for a while and speeds up colonization times. Sounds good right? Obviously works for some people otherwise nobody would have ever came up with this method. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My LC has been colonizing for about two weeks ish. I put 4cc's of spore water into a tablespoon of honey in 200mls H20. I need to search and see if it is ok... or maybe I can just post a pic since it is on topic? without hijacking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/13-009/195305206-IMG_2389.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/13-009/195305206-thumb_IMG_2389.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just give it a little swirl once or twice a day. Not sure about it yet though, like I said need to search more before I try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it is all bad... I learned something right? Big deal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, yes you learned that in two weeks you see &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; in LC, but a grain jar would be fully colonized and ready for grain to grain transfer.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, using LC, you wait, and wait and. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .then when you finally use it, you wait some more to find out if it was contaminated or not so you can start all over again from scratch. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17873597</next>\n<prev>17873433</prev>\n<first>17871564</first>\n<last>17923871</last>\n<when>1361976441</when>\n<utime>02/27/13 04:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
