The sun and air will flash away the ammonia from the urea.  I rarely combine bagged cow manure with straw.  Vermiculite is actually a better choice because it serves as a moisture reservoir.  As for mycelium food, it takes a LOT of straw to do much good, but cow manure is actually higher in mushroom food than horse manure.  Cut it with vermiculite after letting it sit in the sun for a few days, add up to ten percent gypsum to the amount of the manure, hydrate, pasteurize for an hour to an hour and a half at 140F to 170F and use.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
