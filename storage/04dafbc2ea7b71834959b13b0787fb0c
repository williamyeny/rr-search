{"key":"post-7175883","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7175883</id>\n<content>Corn cob is not a spawn material.  It's bulk substrate material so needs to be used in bulk.  The kernels have to be removed.  I works well with cubes when mixed with another substrate, such as straw, horse manure, coir or compost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oyster mushrooms can do fairly well on corn cobs alone.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7175897</next>\n<prev>7175742</prev>\n<first>7175720</first>\n<last>7188908</last>\n<when>1184457570</when>\n<utime>07/15/07 02:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
