It's a two hour drive to the nearest traffic light, and there's three different mountains I can climb, leaving on foot right from my back yard without ever starting the Jeep to drive anywhere.&amp;nbsp; That's why I put up with slow internet. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my dog and I from earlier this winter at the top of 'our' mountain.&amp;nbsp; This is the mountain our cabin is on.&amp;nbsp; There was a cloud layer in the valley, but we climbed through it to bright sunshine above.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/14-005/138349129-Marc_and_Sam_Jan_2014.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/14-005/138349129-thumb_Marc_and_Sam_Jan_2014.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19511978</next>\n<prev>19510846</prev>\n<first>19509129</first>\n<last>19514136</last>\n<when>1391383579</when>\n<utime>02/03/14 01:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
