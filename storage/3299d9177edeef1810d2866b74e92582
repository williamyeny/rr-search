If either of those lime bags give the percent of Mg, make sure it's not over 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gypsum will be fine, but you'll want to smash the pellets into a powder before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coir is a great substrate material.&amp;nbsp; It isn't a 'coir or peat' question because they have different functions.&amp;nbsp; Use coir for the substrate, with gypsum and maybe some of your spent coffee grinds tossed in, but no lime.&amp;nbsp; Use peat moss and vermiculite, with gypsum and lime for the casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8762324</next>\n<prev>8762068</prev>\n<first>8761989</first>\n<last>8775620</last>\n<when>1218556873</when>\n<utime>08/12/08 07:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
