I went through well over 200 petri dishes of mycelium for no other reason than to determine the temperature that stimulates fastest growth, other factors being equal. That was a far more controlled study than the one reported over 20 years ago. If someone else wants to repeat the experiment, go for it.  I consider the matter closed.  Paul doesn't even repeat that 86F figure, which someone else sent him.<br />RR"}}
