'Steep' implies near boiling, which is partial sterilization.  You don't want to sterilize any manure or compost.  My method is to bring it to field moisture capacity, then pasteurize in quart mason jars.  The idea is for the manure in the center of the mason jar to reach 150F to 160F for an hour.  Manipulate the burner on your stove to accomplish that.  The more water you start out with in your kettle, the better.  Begin with cold water.<br />RR"}}
