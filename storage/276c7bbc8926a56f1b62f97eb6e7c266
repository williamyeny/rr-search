Nobody suggests eating the trichoderma itself.  However, mushrooms from the affected substrate are completely fine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the contaminated substrate for a few extra days is not recommended unless you move it outside in the shade.  Otherwise, the fruits should be picked now and the substrate carefully wrapped up and tossed out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5554603</next>\n<prev>5548836</prev>\n<first>5547318</first>\n<last>8042656</last>\n<when>1145845147</when>\n<utime>04/24/06 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
