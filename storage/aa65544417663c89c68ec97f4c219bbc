I've been doing a lot of work restoring dry tissue lately and attempting to develop teks for it.  With all my microscopes, antibiotics, flow hood, other gear and experience, I fail over 75% of the time.  Don't fall into the trap that because you have 'white' growth that you have mushroom mycelium.  The odds with your technique are stacked against you.<br />Roadkill has it right about the sterilized distilled water. The trick is to get pure mushroom mycelium into the sterile water without any trace of nutrients.  Lightly scraping a petri dish to shave off a bit of mycelium while leaving all the agar behind is one method. Stamets himself no longer uses mineral oil to preserve cultures.  There are too many other problems with using oil.<br />If you're isolating strains, don't save any until you fruit out each one to determine which has the qualities you are looking for.  Just keep the originals on well marked/labeled petri dishes in the refrigerator until each strain(isolate) fruits out, then you can make master slants from that culture.  Drop a toothpick into each test tube slant you do, with at least part of the toothpick extending up and out of the agar.  The mycelium will colonize the wood, then can go dormant and last much longer than it would on plain agar.  My slants easily last a year, at which time I take a small piece and transfer to another slant, allow it to colonize, then back into the refrigerator with it.  I have some experiments going now where I put a couple of cc's of sterilized distilled water over the mycelium in the slant.  I'll let a couple of those go for two years without touching to see if it works.  The problem with this method is the test tubes have to be stored in a holder to keep the water above the culture.   I have several hundred stored cultures, so this method would require a larger lab refrigerator to use on all of them.<br />I think workman is looking into cyrogenic storage of cultures, so perhaps he'll have some input on how that works.<br />RR"}}
