I also 'mist' the blocks with a water hose with my thumb over the end, so the water agitates the substrate pretty hard, but not hard enough to break it.&amp;nbsp; This increases yield by as much as they're reporting with the electrical shocks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got my sterilizers going around the clock now gearing up my shiitake farm, so I'll definitely be trying this and a few other tricks over the coming months.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11754602</next>\n<prev>11754495</prev>\n<first>11753034</first>\n<last>11761212</last>\n<when>1262477944</when>\n<utime>01/03/10 02:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
