The casing layer supplies the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll do better with mid to upper 90% humidity.  The higher the humidity, the more air exchange you can supply without excessively drying out your casing layer.  Don't forget to mist daily to replace the moisture that evaporates.  Good luck in your grow!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7536030</next>\n<prev>7535960</prev>\n<first>7535960</first>\n<last>7536042</last>\n<when>1192829567</when>\n<utime>10/20/07 12:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
