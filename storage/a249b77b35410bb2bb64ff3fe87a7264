Salt has long been used to kill trichoderma.  I use it regularly on straw logs and woodchips/sawdust substrates where the trich only forms on the surface.   I don't hold out a lot of hope if it's in a casing layer or bulk substrate before first flush.  That usually indicates the spawn was contaminated, so the mold is probably spread throughout the whole substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6600730</prev>\n<first>6600718</first>\n<last>6601348</last>\n<when>1172248287</when>\n<utime>02/23/07 06:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
