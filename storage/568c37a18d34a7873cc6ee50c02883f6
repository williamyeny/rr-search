Black pin mold is also a common contaminant when excessive heat is used during 'incubation'. <br />I've tried to duplicate that test on agar stamets refers to in his book at various temperatures, and by no means is 86F optimal, even for petri dishes.  There is zero increase in growth beyond 78F, and growth slows down at 84F and above, falling off rapidly around 90F.<br />PF jars can colonize well in two to three weeks at 75F.  Mine are done in two weeks.  How many posts per week do we see where people have had jars in the incubator for a month at 86F and they're still not colonized?  Something else is wrong.  Just use room temperature and you'll have far less problems with bacteria and other contaminants, not to mention your jars won't dry out.  If you're comfortable in the room with a t-shirt on, your jars will be comfortable as well.<br />RR"}}
