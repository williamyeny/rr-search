We pick up to 100 pounds of chanterelles, reishi, hericium, oysters and other edibles on any given weekend, so there's no way dehydrators could keep up.  We often have half the living room floor covered with drying mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get desiccant at any home improvement megacenter, or at any boat or auto parts store.  Boat people use it to dry out the carpets in their boats after a weekend out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6274928</next>\n<prev>6274671</prev>\n<first>6272691</first>\n<last>6318915</last>\n<when>1163346570</when>\n<utime>11/12/06 05:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
