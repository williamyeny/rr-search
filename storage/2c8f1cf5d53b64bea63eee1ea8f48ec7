Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic pH of around 5.5 to 6.5, which is just about what your manure, coir or coffee grinds will be.  They grow fine on grains with no adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime your casing mixes to a basic pH of around 8 to 8.5 to help ward off molds.  Mushroom mycelium will &lt;i&gt;tolerate&lt;/i&gt; a high pH, while molds, which must germinate from spores, will have a much harder time with it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8470729</prev>\n<first>8470711</first>\n<last>8470757</last>\n<when>1212342896</when>\n<utime>06/01/08 08:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
