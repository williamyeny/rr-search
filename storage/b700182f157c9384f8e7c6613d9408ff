Don't use 60% coir or you'll have overlay problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microwave is partial sterilization due to the very hot temperatures.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pasteurize using the pc by loading your already moistened casing material into quart jars and placing in the pc full of &lt;i&gt;cold&lt;/i&gt; water  2/3 the way up the jars.  Turn on the stove and bring the water to a very near boil, then shut off the stove and let the jars sit in the hot water.  Keep the pc covered.   In fifteen minutes, bring once again to a near boil, then shut off the stove.  Remove the jars after another hour and they'll be perfect. The internal temp of the casing material will be 140-160 for over an hour, but will not exceed 170 during that time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5780702</prev>\n<first>5780559</first>\n<last>5780739</last>\n<when>1151009682</when>\n<utime>06/22/06 11:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
