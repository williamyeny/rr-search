{"key":"post-7237096","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7237096</id>\n<content>One of the ways we prevent trich with wood based substrates is by humidity cycling, where humidity is constantly fluctuating between about 60% and 95%, so I don't think that's the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the time from germination of the trich spores, to creating more trich spores(the green) is several days, so when it happens on the day your humidfier fails, it's coincidence.  Trich thrives in stale, still air, so good fresh air with turbulence is the best cure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7241562</next>\n<prev>7234217</prev>\n<first>7234217</first>\n<last>7241562</last>\n<when>1185751717</when>\n<utime>07/30/07 02:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
