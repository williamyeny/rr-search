Respirators are designed to protect the wearer.  We don't require that in mycology.  What we need is to protect our projects from ourselves.  Surgical masks stop at least 99% of your exhaled bacteria.  Respirators, such as the N95 etc., are designed to protect doctors from their patient.  That isn't the use we're putting them to.<br />RR"}}
