After all they only need light for the direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is absolutely wrong.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms don't use light for direction of growth.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown in total darkness will still grow straight up, opposite gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms turn towards the light because they are using it as a source of energy.&amp;nbsp; That's why mushrooms grown with the proper amount and spectrum of light grow much larger and heavier than mushrooms grown with insufficient light.&amp;nbsp; It's also why light is just as important during the growth phase as it is during the pinning stage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13263722</next>\n<prev>13262602</prev>\n<first>13237814</first>\n<last>13271036</last>\n<when>1285774827</when>\n<utime>09/29/10 06:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
