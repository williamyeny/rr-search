I kept getting bacterial contamination in my jars and couldn't figure out why.  I finally realized the filter was getting wet with grain juice when I shake the jars, then the bacteria would colonize right through the filter. I tried them with tyvek and synthetic filter disks and had the same problem.  I went back to the metal lids so I could put the filter material on the outside of the lid rather than the inside. I hope you have better luck than I did, but I don't recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4261176</next>\n<prev>4261073</prev>\n<first>4260186</first>\n<last>4261842</last>\n<when>1118021799</when>\n<utime>06/06/05 04:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
