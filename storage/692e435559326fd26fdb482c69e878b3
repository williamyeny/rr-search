Assuming that jar 1 just contains sterile grain and mushroom mycelium and isn't 25% colonized due to stalling because of a contamination, what is wrong with doing that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't work this way.&amp;nbsp; Our grain 'sterilization' is never complete.&amp;nbsp; We have a short window to get the grains colonized.&amp;nbsp; If you G2G partially colonized grains, the uncolonized ones which transfer will be beyond their window before they get colonized with the second batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can turn one grain jar into an 18 wheeler load of grain spawn in a few weeks using only fully colonized spawn.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine needing to produce grain spawn faster than that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19078821</next>\n<prev>19078140</prev>\n<first>18947412</first>\n<last>19078821</last>\n<when>1383478032</when>\n<utime>11/03/13 01:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
