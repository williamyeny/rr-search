Don't use feed grains, because most have fungicides on them.  I pay $8.75 for a 25 pound bag.  If your store doesn't have it in stock, they can order it for you.  Tell them it's for growing shiitake mushrooms on.  If they ask many questions, next time you go in to pick up your grains, stop at the grocery store and pick up some nice looking shiitake's and take them to them from your 'latest crop'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5676087</next>\n<prev>5675186</prev>\n<first>5674600</first>\n<last>5677389</last>\n<when>1148646019</when>\n<utime>05/26/06 03:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
