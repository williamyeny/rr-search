Another cause of the verm getting damp is not making it thick enough.  Don't fill with brf past the start of the threaded area.  Reserve that last 3/4&quot; for the dry verm.  Remove foil immediately after the jars cool.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7762796</next>\n<prev>7762422</prev>\n<first>7762268</first>\n<last>7763128</last>\n<when>1197765221</when>\n<utime>12/16/07 02:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
