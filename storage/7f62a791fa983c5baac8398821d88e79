Coir makes a good substrate, but a poor casing, especially at sixty percent.  Just look at it as a substrate on top of your spawn.  If it totally colonizes and you want a casing, just top it at that time with peat/verm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6346445</next>\n<prev>6346219</prev>\n<first>6345779</first>\n<last>6351585</last>\n<when>1165559437</when>\n<utime>12/08/06 08:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
