{"key":"post-8308321","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8308321</id>\n<content>The quote from me above answers the question so I don't need to type it over again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the horrible rumor that unpicked fruits/pins will mold will go away, because they WON'T!  In all my years, I've never seen a single abort/pin/invitro fruit that wasn't picked on time grow mold.  Often, they'll 'fuzz up', but it's mushroom mycelium.  Mold will grow on the uncolonzed parts of your casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8308388</next>\n<prev>8308305</prev>\n<first>8307598</first>\n<last>8308762</last>\n<when>1208732488</when>\n<utime>04/21/08 02:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
