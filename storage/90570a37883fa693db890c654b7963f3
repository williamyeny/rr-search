The best way to prevent trichoderma on shiitake blocks is to take them out of the fruiting environment and wash with water every two days or so.  This removes the trich spores before they have a chance to germinate.  During the spring and summer in my area, I do this every day.  I take them to the faucet and wash with a forceful stream of water, then return to the mini-greenhouse.  When I put them in the greenhouse, I leave the door open and the humidifiers off for several hours to allow the blocks to dry out on the surface, then close it all up and re-humidify.  This seems to completely prevent trich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, trich in sawdust/woodchip substrates is usually just on the surface anyway, so you can just cover the area with a salt paste to kill the spores and trich mycelium in that exact area.  The salt paste will wash off the next time you hose them down, but the trich will be dead since it was only on the surface.  (Note to cube growers:  This does not work with cased manure)&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6755261</next>\n<prev>6754652</prev>\n<first>6754465</first>\n<last>6755437</last>\n<when>1175895180</when>\n<utime>04/07/07 12:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
