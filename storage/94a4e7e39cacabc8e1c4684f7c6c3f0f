{"key":"post-7978036","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7978036</id>\n<content>RH has nothing to do with skinny mushrooms.  If the RH is too low, they won't pin at all.  It sounds like a substrate/strain issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hygrometers are useless until they've been calibrated.  Wrap that thing up in a damp towel for an hour, and then unwrap and adjust so it reads 99%, but as said, that isn't the cause of skinny mushrooms. Lack of light and/or poor substrate are the likely causes, provided they're getting enough fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7978039</next>\n<prev>7978014</prev>\n<first>7975497</first>\n<last>7978141</last>\n<when>1202163372</when>\n<utime>02/05/08 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
