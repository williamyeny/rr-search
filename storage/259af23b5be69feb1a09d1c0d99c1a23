Four to one is OK, but will be a tad slower.  Forget the bags.  Spawn the grains into manure no more than 1 1/2 inches deep in a tray.  Pans hate thick substrate layers for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At full colonization, place a thin casing layer of no more than 1/4&quot; on top of the colonized substrate.  Cover with foil for a few days until mycelium is showing through, then place in fruiting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing layer usually fully colonizes, but pins come ten to fourteen days later, which is about a week behind cubes, so be ready for them to take their time and don't mess with it.  Just let them take their time and wait.  They want near 100% humidity, so wrinkle up a sheet of wax paper, then spread it back out and place over the tray.  This will keep the humidity high while still allowing for air exchange under the wrinkled up sheet of wax paper.  Replace the wax paper with a fresh sheet every two days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15591367</next>\n<prev>6248682</prev>\n<first>6248682</first>\n<last>24544874</last>\n<when>1162747874</when>\n<utime>11/05/06 07:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
