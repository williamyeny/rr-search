You don't need to add more moisture to the perlite during the fruiting cycle.  Between cycles, you can add water if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody is fighting.  I had to set the record straight on those who would call me out by name to trash my work without understanding the science or even bothering to read the posts, where the issue of CO2 removal from terrariums has been covered in detail.  You can bet your last dollar that if I advise on something, it's based on many years of experience and literally thousands of grows on all sorts of substrates, with dozens of species.  I don't make this shit up.  Good luck to all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7546319</next>\n<prev>7546277</prev>\n<first>7511309</first>\n<last>7564969</last>\n<when>1193070818</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 07:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
