It is not.  By the time the core of a mycelial network has reached 86F, it's well slowed down over the maximum rate of growth, which occurs between 75F and 81F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people read the incorrect temperature, they do silly things like build incubators, when &lt;i&gt;normal room temperature&lt;/i&gt; will work just fine with far less chance of contamination.  If you have a room that is 75F, use it and allow jars to colonize on an open shelf for best results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7611061</next>\n<prev>7611047</prev>\n<first>7576714</first>\n<last>7611445</last>\n<when>1194551036</when>\n<utime>11/08/07 09:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
