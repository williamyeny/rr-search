Bear in mind however, not all of those small pins that don't grow are aborts.  It's very common to have the pins for first and second flush to form at the same time.  If the pins still look normal and don't turn black, don't pick them with the mature mushrooms.  They'll begin to grow after you pick the first flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5340773</next>\n<prev>5340511</prev>\n<first>5340345</first>\n<last>5340773</last>\n<when>1140975676</when>\n<utime>02/26/06 07:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
