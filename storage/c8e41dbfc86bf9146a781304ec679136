Just barely cover the substrate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really don't need to dunk cased substrates unless they produced a monster flush that drained the moisture out, or it was allowed to dry out during the flush.  Sometimes however, we have to leave all day to go to work, so can't be there to mist.  In these circumstances, dunking a bulk substrate will replace moisture lost during the preceding flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6215880</next>\n<prev>6215369</prev>\n<first>6214528</first>\n<last>6216859</last>\n<when>1161921196</when>\n<utime>10/27/06 06:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
