Those of us who have had access to one have already laid out the air exchange requirements for mushrooms anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best place in my experience to get an analog hygrometer is from a local cigar shop.  Find the high end cigar shop in your area.  They'll have good ones for sale.  Some dude with $20,000 worth of cigars wants his humidor dialed in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need a thermometer.  If you're comfortable in a t-shirt, your mushrooms will be too.  If not, adjust heat or AC as required.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7185544</next>\n<prev>7184551</prev>\n<first>7184317</first>\n<last>7185544</last>\n<when>1184638429</when>\n<utime>07/17/07 05:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
