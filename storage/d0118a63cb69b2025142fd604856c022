One or the other is probably a bad guy, especially if they don't merge into a common whole.  If one is mold as I suspect, you'll see a color change soon. <br />Jar pictures are a challenge.  Try putting two lights at a 45 degree angle to the jar, so that the jar, your two lights, and the camera form the four corners of a box.  That prevents glare from coming back to the camera. Disable the flash. If you must use a flash, spray the jar with a touch of deodorant.  The satin finish from the deodorant spray will dissipate the flash, giving a clearer picture.  News reporters in the field often use that trick, spraying deodorant on their faces just before going on camera since they don't have access to makeup at a fire or accident scene.<br />RR"}}
