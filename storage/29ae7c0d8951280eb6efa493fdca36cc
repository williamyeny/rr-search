Moisten up some coir and set it aside for a few weeks.  I doubt seriously any molds will be able to germinate on it for at least two weeks, usually more like five or six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure the mold was in your spawn.  Try the above experiment to verify.  Always give your jars of spawn the smell test before using.  Even when solid white, a contaminated jar will often smell like soil, rather than fresh mushrooms.  If so, it has molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7869948</next>\n<prev>7867011</prev>\n<first>7864060</first>\n<last>7875895</last>\n<when>1200179850</when>\n<utime>01/13/08 01:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
