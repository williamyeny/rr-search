Soak the hell out of the casing layer.  When you're told to use 3% peroxide, bear in mind that is the strength it's sold at over the counter in the US, so don't dilute it.  Many new growers think they're supposed to dilute what they buy with 97% water and that's incorrect.  Use the stuff from the drug or grocery store full strength and douse that stuff down three times as said above.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6782559</next>\n<prev>6782288</prev>\n<first>6782022</first>\n<last>6808782</last>\n<when>1176479462</when>\n<utime>04/13/07 06:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
