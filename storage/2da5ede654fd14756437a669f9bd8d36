You'll still get some gas exchange because the lid isn't air tight.  At full colnonization, you want maximum fresh air exchange, so I wouldn't use polyfill or anything else on the holes.  Leave them open.  I realize that's not the 'tek', but it's how I'd do it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6804714</next>\n<prev>6804553</prev>\n<first>6804553</first>\n<last>6806924</last>\n<when>1176926504</when>\n<utime>04/18/07 11:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
