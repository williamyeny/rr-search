We weigh down the cakes to submerge them, but in so doing, it also puts them under a bit of pressure, because of the weight of the water above.  This pressure is more than enough to hydrate the cells over a 24 hour period.  Whether increasing the pressure to shorten the time span of dunking would be good or bad remains a subject for experimentation.  I've dunked substrate blocks in the very bottom of a 5 gallon bucket, and the blocks at the bottom of the bucket definitely hydrate faster than the ones near the top.  I've never tried to dunk at a higher pressure than that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I remember someone at another board a few years ago dunking in vacutainers under a vacuum, and it was much faster.  I guess the theory was to draw all the air out of the cells, making it easier(less pressure inside the cell) for the water to get in.  I've never tried this, so experiment away if you're inclined.  Keep us posted.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7785725</next>\n<prev>7785377</prev>\n<first>7781834</first>\n<last>7785806</last>\n<when>1198264104</when>\n<utime>12/21/07 09:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
