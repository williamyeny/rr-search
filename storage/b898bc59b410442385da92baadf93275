If a ten dollar hepa filter could perform as well as a $125 laminar flow filter, nobody would be using flow hoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theory behind a glovebox is to have very still, not sterile, air. Any turbulence from a fan blowing will decrease the effectiveness of the glovebox. Still air is the key. I get the same performance from my glovebox I get from my flowhood, but of course the flowhood is much easier to work in front of then fumbling around in a glovebox.  I installed a set of tyvek wrist sleeves in the openings of my glovebox, then I simply put on a pair of latex gloves and stick my hands through the tyvek sleeves.  This allows me to pull my hand out to heat up my scalpel or inoculating loop with an alcohol lamp that is located outside the glovebox.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4127931</next>\n<prev>4127873</prev>\n<first>4127802</first>\n<last>22587201</last>\n<when>1115148547</when>\n<utime>05/03/05 10:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
