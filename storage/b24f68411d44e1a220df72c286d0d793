THey get light about 10 hours a day.  They shouldnt start pinning unless they get FAE so you shouldnt have to worrry about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct.  The mycelium doesn't know when you're looking at it or not. I currently have over 200 pf jars incubating on an open shelf in a room that's lit at least 18 hours per day.   Light isn't a pinning trigger until the CO2 gets dumped and replaced by fresh air.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget that 1/2 second of light to trigger pinning.  It's incorrect.  Light is only a &lt;i&gt;secondary&lt;/i&gt; pinning trigger.  Full colonization and air exchange are the biggies.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6554535</next>\n<prev>6553509</prev>\n<first>6553394</first>\n<last>6600939</last>\n<when>1171213664</when>\n<utime>02/11/07 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
