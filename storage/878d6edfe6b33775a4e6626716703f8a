Cobweb is grey, not white and very airy.  It sometimes even appears to be 'floating' just above the surface.  Spray with full strength 3% peroxide right out of the bottle.  If the mold disolves instantly on contact, it was cobweb.  If not, you just pissed off your mycelium, but it will get over it.<br />RR"}}
