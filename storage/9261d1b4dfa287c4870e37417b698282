Your physical address information is on the order form you sent in the envelope with the money order, complete with fingerprints. I can't think of giving the cops a more incriminating way to tie you directly to the purchase.&amp;nbsp; Think about it.&amp;nbsp; At least with a credit card, there's only a trail of 1s and 0s, thus you have a reasonable chance of plausible deniability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're worried about leaving a trail, put a small amount of cash in a greeting card or letter with your order information.&amp;nbsp; Keep your orders small to avoid losing very much money if it's stolen in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11556892</next>\n<prev>11556568</prev>\n<first>11555159</first>\n<last>11556892</last>\n<when>1259627158</when>\n<utime>12/01/09 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
