Grain with the proper water content doesn't need any additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is some nutritional benefit to gypsum in grain spawn, the primary purpose is to prevent the grains from sticking together, which makes the jars much easier to shake later.&amp;nbsp; Liquid coffee lowers the pH, helping the mycelium to colonize somewhat faster, but is certainly optional.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13343836</next>\n<prev>13343075</prev>\n<first>13341480</first>\n<last>13346649</last>\n<when>1287249463</when>\n<utime>10/16/10 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
