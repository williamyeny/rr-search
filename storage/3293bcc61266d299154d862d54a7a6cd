Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm certain you could have had the same success/failure simply using the jars without the oven.  Many people have used BRF with no heat treatment whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple fact of physics is that if the interior of your jars had reached 100C/212F, they would have been as dry as the sand in the Sahara Desert.  Therefore, you didn't sterilize your jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight chance those will fruit, but a greater chance they will fail, so it would have been more prudent to post your results after they fruit or turn green.  However, they weren't sterilized, so don't assume they were.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5974597</next>\n<prev>5974363</prev>\n<first>5974058</first>\n<last>5976819</last>\n<when>1155874484</when>\n<utime>08/18/06 07:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
