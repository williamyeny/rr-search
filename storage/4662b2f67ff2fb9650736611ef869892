Sorry friend, toss it out and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd recommend burying that substrate in a pile of straw or manure outside.  It will almost certainly recover and fruit if you put it in the shade and keep it slightly moist.  Definitely get it out of your house asap.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5652525</prev>\n<first>5652441</first>\n<last>5652578</last>\n<when>1148134977</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 05:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
