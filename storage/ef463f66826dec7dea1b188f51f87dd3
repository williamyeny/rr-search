If necessary, go back and forth a few times.  You don't want excessive venting because anytime steam is venting from your PC, it is also venting from your jars, drying them out.  Once pressure is reached and you reduce heat, it's fine if the pressure drops to 10 to 12 psi.  Just increase time slightly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6717713</next>\n<prev>6717482</prev>\n<first>6717482</first>\n<last>6717713</last>\n<when>1175046133</when>\n<utime>03/28/07 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
