But how would it compare to putting the same strain in something filled with more nutrients such as manure? Would they be generally bigger? Would they produce the same amount of psilocybin? More? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have it backwards.&amp;nbsp; BRF is far more nutritious than manure.&amp;nbsp; This is why we can use tiny 1/2 pint brf cakes, but need to use a whole tray of manure.&amp;nbsp; With straw, you must use an even larger substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek#lighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Proper light exposure&lt;/a&gt; will increase your harvest exponentially, resulting in far more product, and it isn't 1/100th the potency those tards suggest.&amp;nbsp; In fact, my research shows the opposite, and that's after 40 years growing with isolated strains, not one grow from spores ordered off the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MisterScience said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A certain expression comes to mind: you are what you eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You calling me a pussy?&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/nono.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:nono:&quot; title=&quot;:nono:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16381496</next>\n<prev>16381439</prev>\n<first>16381044</first>\n<last>16382868</last>\n<when>1339708392</when>\n<utime>06/15/12 12:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
