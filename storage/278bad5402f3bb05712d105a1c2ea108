Ambient room light will have no effect on colonizing mycelium.<br />As for temperature, growth slows down above 83F, so keep your ambient temperature to 81F or below.  There's really nothing to be gained by having your jars at an ambient temperature above 77F, and contaminants are stimulated by higher temperatures as well.  I colonize at normal room temperature.<br />It would be nice to do a clean-sweep of all the outdated information in the archives here, but my time is too limited these days to take it on.  In addition, mrs rabbit and I are in the process of moving to a new place up in the mountains, so my time here is extremely restricted.<br />RR"}}
