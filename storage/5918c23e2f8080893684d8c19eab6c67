You got any idea of the spacing at 15 psi?<br />Regardless, the foil isn't to protect from steam.&nbsp; It's to protect from water drops that rain down from the lid of the pressure cooker during sterilization.&nbsp; All filtered jars should be covered with foil during sterilization.&nbsp; The foil can be reused dozens of times until it disintegrates.<br />RR"}}
