The wood stove is stoked up to bring indoor temps to 75F to 78F, and the humidity in our cabin is just under 30%, even with a cool mist running near the wood stove.&amp;nbsp; The hygrometer in my shotgun terrarium is reading 93%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If necessary, simply run a small coolmist humidifier near the terrarium, or you could probably lay a damp towel over it to help as well.&amp;nbsp; A few mistings per day will also work wonders for your RH.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9277262</next>\n<prev>9276946</prev>\n<first>9239415</first>\n<last>9289336</last>\n<when>1227193736</when>\n<utime>11/20/08 05:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
