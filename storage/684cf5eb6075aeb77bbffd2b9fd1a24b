Some growers make the mistake of packing it down.  Be sure to rake it with your fingers to keep the perlite nice and fluffy and loose.  Condensation on the sides is in no way, shape or form an indication of humidity.  Get a good mechanical hygrometer.  Even with good humidity, you still need to mist.  Misting properly is very important for great pinsets.<br />RR"}}
