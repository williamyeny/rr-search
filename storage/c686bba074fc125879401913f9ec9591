For massive spore dilution, simply squirt a few drops from a syringe into a large glass of sterile water, and then draw the diluted solution into a fresh, clean syringe. However, such can easily lead to non-fruiting strains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another method is to make a spore print, and then lay a cap from another strain over the first print and let it print on top of it.&amp;nbsp; Then, make a syringe as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To breed dikaryons, place two isolated strains on agar an inch or so apart and let them grow together.&amp;nbsp; If a third sector opens up at the point where they meet, it is a cross of the two strains via anastomosis.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9037856</next>\n<prev>9037610</prev>\n<first>9036815</first>\n<last>9037856</last>\n<when>1223327600</when>\n<utime>10/07/08 12:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
