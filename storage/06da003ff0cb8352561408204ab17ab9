If you use hoses, it's best to have them enter at the bottom because humidity tends to stratify in layers, with the higher humidity at the top and the lower humidity at the bottom.  By placing the humidifier inside, it shoots upwards, and the air currents created tend to stir the air around enough to equalize it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6663345</next>\n<prev>6634296</prev>\n<first>6634266</first>\n<last>6663410</last>\n<when>1173045337</when>\n<utime>03/04/07 11:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
