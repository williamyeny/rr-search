Don't use it if the chemicals feed in with the water/steam.  Your jars are not going to be sealed.  Best bet is to get a pressure cooker.  I doubt a medical autoclave can be turned down enough.  Many of those are designed to operate near 100 psi.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6287562</next>\n<prev>6287477</prev>\n<first>6287477</first>\n<last>6287583</last>\n<when>1163649321</when>\n<utime>11/16/06 05:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
