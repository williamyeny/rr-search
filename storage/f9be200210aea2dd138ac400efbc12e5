You'll end up needing to refrigerate/AC the room, which will cause condensation to build up on the outside of the plastic sheeting, which will then result in molds.  I suspect that humidifier will end up with a lot of water dripping on the floor too, so make sure there's a way for it to run to a drain.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also worry about having a water hose connected.  If something were to break down in the humidifier, a water hose can supply enough water to do a lot of damage if it's in a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said already, definitely do something about the electrical panel.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6066206</next>\n<prev>6065368</prev>\n<first>6060878</first>\n<last>6066259</last>\n<when>1158366864</when>\n<utime>09/16/06 03:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
