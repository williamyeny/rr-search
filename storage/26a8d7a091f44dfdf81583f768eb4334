Get some PVC couplings and place four under each tray to elevate them above the perlite.  An alternative is to get hardware cloth (metal) and build a shelf for the trays to sit on.  You need the surface of the perlite exposed.  It also helps to take your hands and fluff up the perlite so it's nice and loose, with an uneven texture on top that will increase surface area.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6683341</next>\n<prev>6683127</prev>\n<first>6678695</first>\n<last>6684366</last>\n<when>1174238830</when>\n<utime>03/18/07 08:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
