You'd never superheat nasty water. In addition, microwaves are generally the filthiest appliance in a kitchen, which is the filthiest room in any house.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give your experiment a go, but personally I see nothing good to come of it.&amp;nbsp; About all that's in the soak/boil water is fermented malts, and most likely quite a few endospores that survived the boiling.&amp;nbsp; I don't see anything being added to the substrate that wouldn't be added when you spawn the rye grain to it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10467319</prev>\n<first>10453562</first>\n<last>10467363</last>\n<when>1244422503</when>\n<utime>06/08/09 03:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
