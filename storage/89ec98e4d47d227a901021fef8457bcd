The compost is fine.  Inky caps often grow in compost piles.  It's a good sign actually.  Just pasteurize well so the spores from them don't grow in your substrate and compete with your mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6493484</next>\n<prev>6491815</prev>\n<first>6490297</first>\n<last>6497900</last>\n<when>1169660561</when>\n<utime>01/24/07 07:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
