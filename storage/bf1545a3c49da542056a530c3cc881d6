I never incubate in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mushie that is growing before full colonization is no problem. Let it grow.  It will NOT contaminate the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to birth and cut the uncolonized parts out, you are almost sure to get contams.  Don't do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even take a jar with lots of invitro mushrooms, and use it for a grain to grain into other jars.  The invitro mushrooms are mycelial tissue, and will transfer into the new jars and help speed up pinning. This process isn't new.  It was touched on in Stamets' book from twenty years ago. If you're sterile in your work, this will not cause contamination.  There is an entire thread over at mycotopia in the archives concerning using pinning jars as a source for spawning compost or grain to grain transfers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mycotopia.net/cgi-bin/discus/show.cgi?tpc=5&amp;amp;post=149792#POST149792&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.mycotopia.net/cgi-bin/discus/show.cgi?tpc=5&amp;amp;post=149792#POST149792&lt;/a&gt;  There will be no contamination if done properly.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2937264</next>\n<prev>2937065</prev>\n<first>2935757</first>\n<last>2943852</last>\n<when>1091054410</when>\n<utime>07/29/04 01:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
