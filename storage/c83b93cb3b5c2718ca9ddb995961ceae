I want to develop the relationship there so with a simple plug and chuck equation. One where you just put in the values of your chamber and it spits out the corresponding hole size and spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgive me if that went above some heads or seems like a dumb question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only head you went above is yours.&amp;nbsp; You can't &lt;i&gt;calculate&lt;/i&gt; flow because it will be different under various atmospheric pressure and temperature scenarios, both of which are constantly in flux.&amp;nbsp; The conditions in your bedroom today won't be the conditions in your bedroom tomorrow or in my bedroom at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why we recommend 1/4&quot; holes every 2&quot; around the tub. It provides an excellent mushroom growing environment over a wide variety of conditions. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20921495</next>\n<prev>20920188</prev>\n<first>20917147</first>\n<last>20923547</last>\n<when>1417616969</when>\n<utime>12/03/14 04:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
