After sterilization, you need to keep the substrate under sterile conditions until fully colonized or it will contaminate.  That's why we use filter patch bags or jars with filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pasteurization only kills fungal spores, leaving the beneficial bacteria intact.  After pasteurization, the substrate need not be kept sterile, so it's suitable for bulk substrates such as straw and manure that are too big for filtered jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6124518</next>\n<prev>6124421</prev>\n<first>6120034</first>\n<last>6128632</last>\n<when>1159816410</when>\n<utime>10/02/06 10:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
