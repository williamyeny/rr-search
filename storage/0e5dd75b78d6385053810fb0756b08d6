Just I have to keep watching the videos and would rather have a copy to sit down and watch instead of viewing online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks fellow trippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That DVD set cost over $100,000 and nearly three years to produce.&amp;nbsp; You can imagine why I get pissy when folks want to steal it.&amp;nbsp; Don't fuck up your karma.&amp;nbsp; Pony up your share.&amp;nbsp; Illegal downloads are exactly the reason I haven't released the follow ups that are already filmed and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you appreciate if you went to work all month and on payday, the boss said, &quot;sorry, somebody already downloaded the paycheck you worked for, so you get nothing.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14802093</next>\n<prev>14801894</prev>\n<first>14801810</first>\n<last>14821123</last>\n<when>1311255734</when>\n<utime>07/21/11 04:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
