As the contents shrink during cooling, contaminants can and will be drawn in.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also loathe to open the PC while it's hot just to tighten lids, and besides, shit can get in under the lid while doing that.&amp;nbsp; When I cook grain jars, I can leave them in the PC overnight, or even for a week, and the grains are still loose, so why open the PC while hot?&amp;nbsp; Until they develop a better plastic, I'll stick with tried and true metal lids.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9752432</next>\n<prev>9752243</prev>\n<first>9749542</first>\n<last>11075162</last>\n<when>1233978401</when>\n<utime>02/07/09 05:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
