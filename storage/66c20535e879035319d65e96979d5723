The cure however is to kill the larvae, which most likely are in the soil of your houseplants.  Simply inspect all of your houseplant's soil to determine which one the gnats are emerging from.  There are two cures I know of.  One is to drown them.  Place the entire pot containing your houseplant into a five gallon bucket of water.  Make sure the water level is at least two inches above the level of the top of the flowerpot.  Leave it there for 48 hours without any sort of bubbler or anything else.  This will drown the larvae.  The second cure is a BT that is specially made to target fungus gnats.  Here is one source for this.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gardensalive.com/product.asp?pn=1962&amp;amp;ss=gnats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.gardensalive.com/product.asp?pn=1962&amp;amp;ss=gnats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4153318</next>\n<prev>4152571</prev>\n<first>4152190</first>\n<last>4863970</last>\n<when>1115651807</when>\n<utime>05/09/05 06:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
