Briefly stated, if you took a piece of white paper and looked at it under 2,000K such as you'd get from hps, it would look yellow.  If you looked at it under 5,000K fluorescent tubes such as you'd find in an office or school classroom, it will look white.  If you look at it under 7,500K fluorescent, it would have a blue tint to it.  That's what is meant by 'blue' light.  You can pick up an inexpensive fluorescent fixture and 7500K fluorescent tubes fairly cheaply at your local hardward store.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7485872</next>\n<prev>7485570</prev>\n<first>7481861</first>\n<last>7487952</last>\n<when>1191542122</when>\n<utime>10/05/07 02:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
