The first, is that there is a great legacy of cultivation on this side...good and bad. Historically, I find this stuff fascinating and would never want it to just disappear. This is our history. To me, this should always be preserved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In which case copy all the disinformation and save it to your computer.&amp;nbsp; When I see bad info, I nuke it.&amp;nbsp; You wouldn't want to study a science textbook in school from 500 years ago simply because it's 'history'.&amp;nbsp; Inaccurate information has no place in a forum where new folks are trying to learn what to do and reading bad stuff fucks up their hard work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16051948</next>\n<prev>16039336</prev>\n<first>15329243</first>\n<last>21325979</last>\n<when>1333496462</when>\n<utime>04/04/12 02:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
