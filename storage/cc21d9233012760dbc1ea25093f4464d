However, 300 cfm won't cut it due to the losses involved.  My flowhood is 2 square feet and has a 650 cfm blower that is barely enough.  Add the extra 1/3 surface area, and it works out to 750 cfm to get the same speed I have which will bend the flame of a bic lighter over 45 to 90 degrees, but not blow it out.  <br />Sorry, I had too many things going on at once as I typed earlier and got sidetracked.  I still stand by the 750 cfm.  You can get one from Grainger for around $150.<br />RR"}}
