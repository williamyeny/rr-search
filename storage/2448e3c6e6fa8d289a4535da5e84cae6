The turbulence they create stirs up and circulates more contaminants than they filter out.  I used to run one in every major room of the house, but now they're all sitting in the storage shed. My contamination problems are less without the hepas.  Now, I do LOVE my flowhood, but those units you buy at the hardware store aren't worth getting, imo.<br />RR"}}
