Here's a shot dragging the shipping container across our upper pasture.&nbsp; The summit in the background is my personal snowboard mountain all winter. Our cabin is nearly 2/3 of the way up the mountain, from the nearest paved road six miles away. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif\" alt=\":laugh:\" title=\":laugh:\"/><br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-21/269503541-Mushroom_house_037a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-21/269503541-thumb_Mushroom_house_037a.jpg\"></a><br />"}}
