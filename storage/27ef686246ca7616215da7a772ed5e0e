{"key":"post-6978305","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6978305</id>\n<content>I think the idea that coir has no nutritional value comes from its use in hydroponics as a way to stabilize root systems.  It's true that when used like that it has little to no NPK value, however NPK is not used in mycology.  Coir is a rich fungi food, easily the equal of manure or straw.  For the most bang, mix it with manure, worm castings, coffee grinds and straw.  Add gypsum and pasteurize before use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6978309</next>\n<prev>6978302</prev>\n<first>6978065</first>\n<last>6978739</last>\n<when>1180388698</when>\n<utime>05/29/07 12:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
