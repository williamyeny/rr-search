That 'rule' still stands but must be taken with a grain of salt.&amp;nbsp; Most low resistance filters for clean rooms are around 11&quot; to 12&quot; thick.&amp;nbsp; Since there's less resistance, a larger plenum helps to mitigate the unsuitability by giving more area for the air to pressurize, thus a more even pressure is applied to the plenum side of the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more suitable filter for flow hood use will have a higher resistance, and will generally be half or less as thick as a clean room filter, even though that seems counter-intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason is that a higher flow filter needs more thickness to trap the particulates.&amp;nbsp; A lower flow filter with a higher resistance will make it possible to pressurize the plenum sufficiently to achieve laminar flow.&amp;nbsp; In layman's terms, laminar flow simply means the air leaving the filter is flowing at the same speed regardless of where on the filter its measured.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>26138560</next>\n<prev>26137622</prev>\n<first>26136637</first>\n<last>26138560</last>\n<when>1565966452</when>\n<utime>08/16/19 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
