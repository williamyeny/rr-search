I've found fastest colonization temps to be in the 78F to 81F range(ambient temp).  Temperatures above that will stimulate molds and thermophilic bacteria, while actually slowing down mushroom mycelium.  A lower colonization temp will give you reduced contamination percentages.  Good luck.<br />RR"}}
