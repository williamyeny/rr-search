What got everyone started using these things?&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol will kill any bacteria you run into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oust is used to kill bacteria that is in suspension in the air.&amp;nbsp; Alcohol will kill bacteria on surfaces.&amp;nbsp; I work in front of a flowhood, so before I start it up, I fog the air with oust, let the fog work for ten minutes, Lysol the face of the flowhood filter, and then start the flowhood up to run for an hour or two in a closed room before working.&amp;nbsp; At $4 per can, Oust is cheap insurance against bacterial contamination.&amp;nbsp; One bad grain master can cost me fifty times that much if the bacteria doesn't multiply enough to be noticed until after a grain to grain transfer or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For gloveboxes, use soap and water.&amp;nbsp; They need not be sterile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11672580</next>\n<prev>11672291</prev>\n<first>11670020</first>\n<last>11703388</last>\n<when>1261116143</when>\n<utime>12/18/09 08:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
