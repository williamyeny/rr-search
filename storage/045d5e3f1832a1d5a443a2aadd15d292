This is mycelium from dry tissue that was rejuvenated from an old bag of dried mushrooms.  Since the dry tissue it generated from was dikaryotic, these cell lines started out as dikaryons.  <br />There's still a lot of bacterial rods attached to the growing mycelium even though none are visible in the above micrograph, so more cleanup is going to be required before a fruiting run is undertaken.<br />RR"}}
