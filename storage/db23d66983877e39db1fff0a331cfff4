It makes no difference if the substrate is cased or uncased.  A cased substrate can still get some pinning at a lower humidity than cakes, but performance is always better when high humidity is maintained.  The old adage of 85% for cased substrates, 100% for cakes is just plain wrong.  None of the experienced, successful growers fruit casings at lower humidities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants to have a signature can have one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7092158</next>\n<prev>7091479</prev>\n<first>7091210</first>\n<last>7094935</last>\n<when>1182811019</when>\n<utime>06/26/07 01:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
