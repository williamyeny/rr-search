(no simmering).&lt;br /&gt;why wouldn't it absorbe water or very much water like most other people who post these teks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;grain prep tek video&lt;/a&gt;. It's only a few sample clips from the full release on DVD, but you'll get the point.&amp;nbsp; The boil is not to absorb water.&amp;nbsp; After 24 hours of soaking, the grains are fully hydrated.&amp;nbsp; If you drain and load, they'll be too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We boil to kill bacteria that has germinated during the soak time, and to heat the grains up so that when you drain them, they also steam-dry on the outside.&amp;nbsp; Cold grains won't get dry enough and that's your problem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12304443</next>\n<prev>12302484</prev>\n<first>12297689</first>\n<last>12308893</last>\n<when>1270051025</when>\n<utime>03/31/10 06:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
