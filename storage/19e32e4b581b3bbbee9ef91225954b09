I see no evidence whatsoever of it being &quot;disproven&quot;, and this thread is not at all about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, the whole blue light nonsense came into being 30 years ago when TMC was being written.&amp;nbsp; A cubensis grow was being conducted in total darkness, except for taking a photograph once a day.&amp;nbsp; The substrate pinned, therefore it was (incorrectly) deduced that 430 nm or whatever the 35mm camera flash projected for a millisecond or two is what triggered the fruiting.&amp;nbsp; We now know that cubensis pins and fruits in total darkness, even if poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best pinning and growth performance will come from a normal day/night schedule with lights in the 5000K to 7000K range, or a bright window.&amp;nbsp; Above and below that they'll still work, but performance isn't at its peak.&amp;nbsp; Light is far more important &lt;i&gt;after pinning&lt;/i&gt;, since mushrooms will grow far larger and heavier in the presence of bright 'daylight' spectrum lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other point, how exactly is a bacterium going to interact with a salt to produce food for mycelium?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18407912</next>\n<prev>18407813</prev>\n<first>18135103</first>\n<last>27005031</last>\n<when>1371056551</when>\n<utime>06/12/13 08:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
