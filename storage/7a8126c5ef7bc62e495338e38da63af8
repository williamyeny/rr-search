Colonization benefit from indirect light all Tc's agreed with that . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colonizing substrate should be kept in dark to make sure the substrate doesn't pin prematurely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not make noobs life easier ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/5124/Do-mushrooms-need-light-to-grow-and-how-much&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/5124/Do&lt;wbr&gt;-mushrooms-need-light-to-grow-and&lt;wbr&gt;-how-much&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixed.
