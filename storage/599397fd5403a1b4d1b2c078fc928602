Place the hygrometer in the center of the terrarium, sitting on the perlite or a piece of foil, like the cakes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12765144</next>\n<prev>12764964</prev>\n<first>12764964</first>\n<last>12765340</last>\n<when>1276905784</when>\n<utime>06/19/10 03:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
