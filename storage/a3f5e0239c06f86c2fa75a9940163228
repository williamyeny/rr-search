Most of them that I've known have been incredibly ignorant and can't even fix a leaking toilet.  You should also grow edibles, so there is always lots of spawn jars of various species.  The spawn grows for several weeks, before you have four or five days of fruiting.  The random chances of anyone finding anything is during the spawn stage, which is fine because there are no actives.  If anyone busts your grow then, you have an excellent chance of winning a suit for destroying your edible/medicinal crop.  Never sell.  People that get busted, usually get busted for going to a rave or hip hop club, etc., and trying to sell baggies.<br />RR"}}
