I know RR says 5 and you might see some &quot;mycological word&quot; for degradation of mycelium. I want to know how many transfers I can go from a MS jar without risking any possible bad side effects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a little like asking how many miles can you drive a red car before it runs out of gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have to quantify the question if you want more than speculation.&amp;nbsp; There's a huge difference in mycelium expansion between grain to grain transfers with 1/2 pint jars and the same thing with quart jars.&amp;nbsp; If one is using filter patch bags with 5 quarts of grains in each, the mycelium must expand much more on each transfer, thus you can't just count the number of transfers, but the actual amount of cell division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time also plays a big role.&amp;nbsp; Aged mycelium will not expand as far as young mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've posted before, I use fairly young cell lines, and expand with up to 5 grain to grain transfers with large filter patch bags before any degradation sets in, and then there's still enough energy left for that mycelium to colonize the bulk substrate and fruit.&amp;nbsp; In other words, one petri dish of mycelium can easily be expanded to enough grain spawn to fill a small warehouse if you do it fast.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15724191</next>\n<prev>15723741</prev>\n<first>15723225</first>\n<last>15724417</last>\n<when>1327677475</when>\n<utime>01/27/12 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
