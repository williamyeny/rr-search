After a 24 to 36 hour soak, a five minute boil is plenty.  The main reason for the boil is to heat up the grains, so when you drain them, the rye will dry on the outside because of the heat/steam coming off the hot kernals.  Drain for half an hour, while shaking the collander a few times to release the steam.  Only load the jars when the rye looks and feels dry to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DubiousDuo has the right idea.  Always use the metal lid against the jar.  Have a couple of very small holes in the lid, with your tyvek or synthetic filter disk on the outside, then the band.  This will keep your filter dry.  If the filter gets wet, you're screwed.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3506849</next>\n<prev>3506485</prev>\n<first>3506279</first>\n<last>3507520</last>\n<when>1103172250</when>\n<utime>12/16/04 06:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
