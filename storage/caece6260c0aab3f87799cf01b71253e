It usually takes several transfers to get ahead of the contaminants, and if you wait until they show up, it's too late.  By taking from the leading edge of the growth, you're the farthest from the original transfer, and the least likely to have contaminants present.<br />It's good to see you get imaginative to make a ghetto glovebox to do agar work in.  I take clear plastic trash bags to the forest to clone mushrooms in.  We often find rare polypores such as fomitopsis officinalis and I don't want to have to pick it to clone.  You can do work even in the field with the fruit still attached to the tree with those.  Good luck with the cultures.  Nice save.<br />RR"}}
