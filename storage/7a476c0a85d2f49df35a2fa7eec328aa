My first time using rye grass seed, last week, I poured the excess water off before pressure cooking, and now my jars seem a tad bit on the dry side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&amp;nbsp; Since we don't rinse, simmer, or boil rye grass seed the way we do with rye grain, the water doesn't fully absorb until you put it in the pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; It's best to mix the water and seed, and then shake well.&amp;nbsp; Let it sit for an hour or two and shake again, and then PC.&amp;nbsp; The hour or two of sitting is optional, but seems to help the seeds to hydrate a bit slower, avoiding damage.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17079987</next>\n<prev>17077566</prev>\n<first>17073472</first>\n<last>17079987</last>\n<when>1350910784</when>\n<utime>10/22/12 03:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
