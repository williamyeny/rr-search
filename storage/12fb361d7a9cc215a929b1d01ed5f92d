Since it isn't fully colonized after two weeks, something is wrong.  As agar said, start over.  Corn is notorious for harboring bacterial endospores that survive the pressure cooking cycle to germinate a week or so later.  Try again with rye or wild bird seed.  Make sure you have a hole or two in the lid, with a filter over that.  If the mycelium runs out of O2, it will stall and die.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6637075</next>\n<prev>6636991</prev>\n<first>6636690</first>\n<last>6672920</last>\n<when>1173113325</when>\n<utime>03/05/07 06:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
