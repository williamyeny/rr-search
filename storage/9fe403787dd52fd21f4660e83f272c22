{"key":"post-5775481","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5775481</id>\n<content>I use a liquor bottle to sterilize agar.  You can stuff the top with polyfill, then cover with foil.  Pour the dishes after the agar has cooled to the point you can handle the bottle without burning your hands, but before it has solidified.  I use 40 minutes in the PC at 15lbs for a .750 ml bottle filled 3/4 full.  That is the perfect amount of agar for a sleeve of 20 dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't open the sleeve of dishes until you're in your glovebox or in front of a flowhood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5775006</prev>\n<first>5774750</first>\n<last>5775481</last>\n<when>1150888347</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 02:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
