Fungi grows very well on petrolium products.  You don't want your PC growing molds that you might not be able to see.

It's pretty easy to put a small dab of Vaseline around the seal.  A tiny blob no larger than a kernel of corn is enough to coat the sealing surface.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6668433</next>\n<prev>6667947</prev>\n<first>6663862</first>\n<last>6668433</last>\n<when>1173892220</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 08:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
