I have never been turned away empty when I've asked for horse manure for my organic garden.  Usually, they shovel it up and stick it in a pile in the sun in a far corner of the yard.  That's where you need to go scoop it up.  It will already be dry and sun bleached.  Seriously, they'll be glad somebody wants to haul it off for them.<br />RR"}}
