Mushrooms will pin with full colonization, increased air exchange, 95% to 100% humidity, and light for several hours per day, regardless of temperature.  Many species will pin with only a few minutes of light per day, but pinsets are much better with several hours, up to 12 per day of bright light.<br />RR"}}
