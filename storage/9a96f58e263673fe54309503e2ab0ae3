You seriously need line breaks between paragraphs.  I did see a serious mistake in step 10, because mushroom mycelium is not mold, so it takes more than one spore to get a fruiting strain.  I'd say you still have a lot of work to do. I'd suggest hanging around for a few years and learning the ropes of mushroom growing before trying to write teks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for not including any links per our private message exchange, but this is seriously off-topic for our forum.
