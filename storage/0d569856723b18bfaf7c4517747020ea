Keep it simple folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if your air purifier was connected backwards, it would be sucking air out of the terrarium, thus providing air exchange just as if it were connected the other way.  At this point, I'd do as suggested already and dunk and roll your cakes and put them back in.  Get your humidity up to 95% with constant air exchange and you'll be golden.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7484188</next>\n<prev>7484182</prev>\n<first>7484145</first>\n<last>7484766</last>\n<when>1191511737</when>\n<utime>10/04/07 06:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
