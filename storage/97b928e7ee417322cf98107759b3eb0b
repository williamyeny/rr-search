That's the strength it comes from the store in the US, so use it full strength.  In other countries it comes in 10%, in which case, they would need to dilute it a bit over 3 to 1 to get the same 3%.  Hydroponic stores sell it in 30%, in which case you'd dilute it 10 to 1 before using.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6570453</prev>\n<first>6564856</first>\n<last>6570601</last>\n<when>1171567327</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 09:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
