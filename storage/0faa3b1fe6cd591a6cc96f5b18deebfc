It's very easy to pasteurize in a large kettle with the material loaded into jars, and there's no mess.  The oven is a terrible way to pasteurize because air is a crappy conductor of heat into moisture. In the oven, the edges of your bag of substrate get sterilized, which is bad, while the middle is still cool, which is also bad. Water works much better.<br />RR"}}
