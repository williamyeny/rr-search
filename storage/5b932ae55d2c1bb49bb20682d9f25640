I feel like having that layer of just dung (no verm/straw/spawn) on top would help protect from contams tho.. almost like a casing layer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct.&amp;nbsp; I prefer layering, or actually a combination of layering and mixing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate several layers of substrate and spawn.&amp;nbsp; I've found this works faster and better than thorough mixing, but either way works.&amp;nbsp; The important thing is to have no exposed grains, which are much more prone to contamination if exposed on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with those above about flipping the substrate.&amp;nbsp; Bad idea, as is the pillow case.&amp;nbsp; It makes a horrible mess.&amp;nbsp; Small amounts of manure or coir, etc., can be pasteurized without making a mess in jars, as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Horse-Manure-Substrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;horse manure tek video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14323274</next>\n<prev>14322398</prev>\n<first>14316629</first>\n<last>14327569</last>\n<when>1303328795</when>\n<utime>04/20/11 10:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
