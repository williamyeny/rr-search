Banging the jars against a car or bicycle tire, or phone book works well. If it's not fully recovered in four days, toss it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9503777</next>\n<prev>9503041</prev>\n<first>9501368</first>\n<last>9516817</last>\n<when>1230421088</when>\n<utime>12/28/08 01:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
