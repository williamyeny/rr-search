Light is very important to establish a circadian rhythm in the mycelium, just as in mammals.  Indirect sunlight is great, as is natural daylight fluorescent tubes.  Mycelium requires a period of darkness for best performance. Research has for many years shown that fruits grow fastest during the period of darkness.  <br />Light has little to do with which way is up, by the way.  Most grow-tubs folks use have light coming in the sides, but the mushrooms still know which way is 'up', even though they tend to lean towards the light somewhat.<br />Bright, high frequency light is very important in the hyphal knot forming stage, and it needs to be powerful enough to penetrate the casing layer if one is used.  Less light will still get you a flush, but bright, high frequency light will help deliver the most your mycelium is capable of.<br />RR"}}
