Inject and then draw the water from deep within the cake.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's even better with a quart jar of rye grain.  I can make well over 100 syringes from a single jar of grains, two weeks after the grain jar was inoculated.  You'll never get that kind of performance from liquid cultures, that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7542415</next>\n<prev>7538423</prev>\n<first>7538232</first>\n<last>7542843</last>\n<when>1192894069</when>\n<utime>10/20/07 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
