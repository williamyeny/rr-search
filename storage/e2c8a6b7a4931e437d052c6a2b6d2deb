Most likely it was caused from drying out during the time from your dunk until now.  The only blue mold I know of is penicillium, and it's usually a perfectly round circle, and much darker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to repeat here for all to see, there is no need to throw away mushrooms from a mold contaminated cake.  Green and Blue/green molds are not pathogenic to humans, although you don't want to leave a contaminated cake in your grow area because it will puke spores all over everywhere, ruining your future projects.  Also, never sniff mold spores.  Don't eat a mushroom that is rotten or otherwise contaminated with bacteria, as that will give you food poisoning unless you boil it first.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4134116</next>\n<prev>4134028</prev>\n<first>4134028</first>\n<last>4206789</last>\n<when>1115251076</when>\n<utime>05/05/05 02:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
