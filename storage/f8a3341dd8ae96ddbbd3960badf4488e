After a 24 hour soak, I once accidentally left the water in a rapid boil for nearly an hour.  There were no burst kernels and they weren't any fatter than they'd have been after a ten minute boil.  I used them and they were fine.  The secret against cracked kernels is to soak the grains first, and then to heat the water and grains together slowly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7686541</next>\n<prev>7686296</prev>\n<first>7685783</first>\n<last>7694898</last>\n<when>1196203272</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 12:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
