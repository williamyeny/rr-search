This is assuming one is doing cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the holes on the FC, they look ok.  I would still fan and mist daily though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cakes should be kept at close to 100% humidity as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know how to say if those holes are too big or not without something to judge them by.  1/4&quot; works great for the holes.  It's important to note that a 1/2&quot; hole is 4 times as large as a 1/4&quot; hole, so if they're too big, you can easily dry out the air within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure holes are on all six sides, as this is important for proper air exchange and humidity.  If you have trouble maintaining humidity, simply run a coolmist humidifier in the room your fruiting chamber is located.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7976785</prev>\n<first>7975230</first>\n<last>7977042</last>\n<when>1202143347</when>\n<utime>02/04/08 06:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
