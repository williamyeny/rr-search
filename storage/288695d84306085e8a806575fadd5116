Cool white fluorescents have the correct frequency of light for maximum performance and use very little power to run.  Don't use flashing lights.  If you use LED's make sure they stay on for at least a few hours.  12/12 is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6285152</prev>\n<first>6284865</first>\n<last>6285303</last>\n<when>1163607108</when>\n<utime>11/15/06 06:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
