Sporeworks also has an excellent MEA, but I was out at the time, so used some FP agar mix I had(you'll notice I turned the jar so the label didn't show &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;. In real-life, I mix my own, but for the new growers watching the DVD, I wanted to make it as easy as possible, while still getting good results.&amp;nbsp; Once you gain a bit of experience, mix your own.&amp;nbsp; Use 20 grams of agar-agar per liter of water to solidify the mix, but use less nutrients than the recipes call for, for the reasons stated above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide is toxic to fungi, ALL fungi, so the last thing you want is peroxidated agar.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to transfer healthy mycelium away from contaminants, not hide or prevent the contaminants from growing temporarily.&amp;nbsp; You actually WANT the contaminants to grow on your agar so you can see them and get your mycelium away.&amp;nbsp; Antibiotics are a great addition if you're trying to isolate mushroom mycelium from an outdoor fruit that is laden with bacteria.&amp;nbsp; Antibiotics, which are made from mycelium metabolites, won't impede your mycelium, but WILL impede bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8966847</next>\n<prev>8961597</prev>\n<first>8961304</first>\n<last>8966965</last>\n<when>1222012347</when>\n<utime>09/21/08 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
