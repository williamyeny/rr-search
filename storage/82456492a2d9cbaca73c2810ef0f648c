The devices with a remote probe are thermostats, not humidistats which have a fine hair that expands and contracts, which then operates a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disadvantage to using a humidistat is they clog up with spores and stop working if you're not judicious about harvesting at the proper time.   The alternative is to get a cycle timer and by trial and error get the timing right for your own situation, which will change depending on how full the greenhouse is, season of the year, temperature, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5977942</next>\n<prev>5977930</prev>\n<first>5977324</first>\n<last>5978210</last>\n<when>1155995631</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 04:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
