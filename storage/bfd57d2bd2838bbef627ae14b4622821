You might want to get one of those to mount behind the greenhouse for each shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current setup is a larger fluorescent fixture that holds four 48&quot; tubes, and I have it hanging vertically so it shines in from the front to bathe all five shelves in bright light.  I have it about 12&quot; from the door of the GH, so the farthest any substrate is from the light is about 36&quot;.   The fruits tend to grow toward the light a bit, but that problem is fixed by rotating the trays 180 degrees every couple of days so growth is even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad to see you got the right frequency of light.  6500K is awesome.  You'll never go back to silly night lights or cool white fluorescent after using one of those.  They really do make a difference in pinsets.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6741625</next>\n<prev>6741060</prev>\n<first>6741043</first>\n<last>6744252</last>\n<when>1175616181</when>\n<utime>04/03/07 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
