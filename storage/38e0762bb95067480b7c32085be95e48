Can you set them near a west window where they'll get some sun in the afternoon?  If you can warm them up for even a couple of hours a day they'll do ok, but otherwise I think you're going to be disappointed.  Perhaps a space heater in the room?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6654067</next>\n<prev>6653882</prev>\n<first>6653882</first>\n<last>6663618</last>\n<when>1173495014</when>\n<utime>03/10/07 04:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
