Syringes should always be boiled before re-use.  This isn't a tek, it's simply stating what has been said over and over again for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also no need or reason to PC a syringe.  Plastic doesn't harbor bacterial endospores, so anything that might be on a syringe will be killed off by simply boiling.  You still need to flame the needle between jars.  As hyphae pointed out, you certainly don't need a separate syringe for each jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7141481</next>\n<prev>7141390</prev>\n<first>7137215</first>\n<last>7183240</last>\n<when>1183820035</when>\n<utime>07/07/07 05:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
