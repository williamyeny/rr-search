Microwaves are horribly filthy.  Assuming you have completly cleaned everything inside so it looks good enough for your mom to come visit, it's still filthy.  The reason is the magnetron tube is behind that plastic cover, and air pumps from the inside of the microwave through there to cool it and back.  Any leftovers that make steam get that steam and other slop pumped into areas that can't be cleaned.<br />With that said, you don't want to sterilze your casing mix anyway.  You want to pasteurize your casing mix.  It's easy to do in a large pot of water in quart jars.  Just put the jars of moistened casing mix or compost in a large kettle(the PC works great) of cold water, then cover and bring it to a boil.  Once it comes to a boil, shut off the stove.  Leave the jars sitting in the hot water for an hour, then remove.  It's simple as that and no mess, no pillow case, no draining.  Microwaves should be used for pizza and ants, not mycology.<br />RR"}}
