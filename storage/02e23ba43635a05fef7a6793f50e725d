The current fad of making LC directly from spores is responsible for many failures.  Personally, I'd never consider making an LC with anything but mycelium that I had ran across the flat plane of a petri dish to check for contaminants.  Build a glovebox and make up some agar plates to check and isloate your strains on.  Inoculate grains with an agar wedge, then do a grain to grain transfer to increase mass.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6173145</next>\n<prev>6172930</prev>\n<first>6172930</first>\n<last>6173270</last>\n<when>1160960413</when>\n<utime>10/16/06 04:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
