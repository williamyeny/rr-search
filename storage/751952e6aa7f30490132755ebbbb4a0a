The basic formula of 2-1-1 works great with fine or medium verm, but if you're using course verm, you might want to cut down a bit on the water.  I've found that cakes as well as grains, and even bulk substrates colonize a bit better and faster if made up on the dry side.  With cakes, it's easy to adjust the water down, and then simply do a dunk and roll at birthing to put the moisture in for the flush at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the first batch comes out a bit too wet, simply reduce moisture by 10% to 20% on the next batch until you find the sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd still recommend the occasional fanning. You simply can't have too much air exchange, and the turbulence from fannings helps prevent trich from getting a foothold on your projects.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6951207</next>\n<prev>6950903</prev>\n<first>6950605</first>\n<last>12843126</last>\n<when>1179845578</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
