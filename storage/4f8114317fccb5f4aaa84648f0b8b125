Perhaps if you got one of stamets' later works, you'd see he no longer uses that 84F to 86F figure, nor does he recommend incubating in total darkness.<br />I take it a step farther by recommending against 'incubating' at all, having found over my 35+ years of experience that room temperature is the best compromise between speed of colonization, and contamination prevention.<br />apokkalyps, regardless of whether you agree or disagree, learn to compose your questions accurately, and if you can't do that, don't flame others for failing to read your mind.  Furthermore, don't come in here quoting somebody's book, as if it were etched in stone for all to believe and follow, or be stupid.  That's not how it works.  I can point to a book that say the earth is only 6,000 years old and god rides a cloud to heaven, while angels blow trumpets, but that doesn't make it so.<br />RR"}}
