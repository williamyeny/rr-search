{"key":"post-19384253","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>19384253</id>\n<content>Let's not forget the fact that jar filters are not 100% effective, especially verm filters which shift when new growers feel a need to look at their jars twice a day.&amp;nbsp; In an enclosed box, when one jar goes bad, the escaping mold spores easily get into the other jars via any imperfections in the filters.&amp;nbsp; This is a big reason why people using incubators in the past had historically higher contamination rates than those who colonize at the same temperature on an open shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another recurring problem over the years with incubators of all designs is when the made in china thermostat in the fish tank heater sticks in the on position, the tank heats up enough to kill or weaken the mycelium.&amp;nbsp; Thermophilic bacteria if present and some molds are favored by these high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat doesn't magically cause mold spores to materialize but if they are there it will favor them over mushroom mycelium which doesn't appreciate being over about 80F, referring to the temperature &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, regardless of how sterile you made the jar and filter, if you injected with spores from a spore print, I guarantee you also injected some mold and bacteria along with it regardless of who made the print and syringe.&amp;nbsp; You want to favor your mushroom mycelium over these contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19384313</next>\n<prev>19384243</prev>\n<first>19383196</first>\n<last>19384846</last>\n<when>1389144784</when>\n<utime>01/08/14 03:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
