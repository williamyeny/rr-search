Provided you sterize the grains properly, I've found the biggest cause of wet spot bacteria is damp filters on jars.  Bacillus is floating in the air all around us.  If your filter is wet, the bacteria will colonize right through it and get to your grains.  The filter on your jars must be on the outside of the jar so it can stay totally dry at all times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5193358</next>\n<prev>5188007</prev>\n<first>5187649</first>\n<last>5195487</last>\n<when>1137507977</when>\n<utime>01/17/06 04:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
