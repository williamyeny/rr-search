It's harder to keep the humidity up in a new, nearly empty greenhouse, but one that is full of substrates is much easier to humidify.  The trays of damp perlite work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6066830</next>\n<prev>6066254</prev>\n<first>6065801</first>\n<last>6067416</last>\n<when>1158376006</when>\n<utime>09/16/06 06:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
