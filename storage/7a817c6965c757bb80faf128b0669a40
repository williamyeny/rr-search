Yes, I built a place for it to hang.  To open it, I simply roll up the PVC and 'door' from the bottom.  It makes a nice little roll to hang on the hooks at the top.  My entire greenhouse is framed with PVC pipe and covered with plastic sheeting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a self contained air conditioning system to use when fruiting cold weather loving mushrooms such as oyster and shiitake.  I can keep the greenhouse at 58F, while the room outside is 70F.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7693000</prev>\n<first>6355086</first>\n<last>7693134</last>\n<when>1196316380</when>\n<utime>11/29/07 08:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
