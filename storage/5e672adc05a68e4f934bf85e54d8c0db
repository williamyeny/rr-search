But when you scoop them out of the jar you'll be breaking it up anyway, so just leave it. Be careful in the fridge b/c it's a host for contams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite.  Colonized grain jars break apart very easily by banging against a fully inflated bike tire, and you NEVER want to scoop out grains.  it damages the kernels, leaving them open for bacteria, and adds an additional vector of contamination to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer the original question, don't shake or otherwise break up the kernels.  Take them out of the refrigerator a few days before use so they can wake back up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6570519</next>\n<prev>6570461</prev>\n<first>6570429</first>\n<last>6570582</last>\n<when>1171564751</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 08:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
