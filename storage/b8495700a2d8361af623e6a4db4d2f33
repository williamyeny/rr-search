For a given resistance, more flow means you naturally develop more static pressure.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine blowing through a straw using your mouth.&amp;nbsp; If you blew real easy, there would be almost no (static) pressure against the inside of your cheeks, but also not much flow.&amp;nbsp; If you blew harder, there would be more flow, but also more pressure against the inside of your cheeks(static pressure) The straw diameter would determine &lt;i&gt;resistance&lt;/i&gt;, and the air coming out the straw would be the cfm(flow), and how hard you exhaled would create the static pressure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10639642</next>\n<prev>10639430</prev>\n<first>10637237</first>\n<last>10642332</last>\n<when>1247032521</when>\n<utime>07/08/09 08:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
