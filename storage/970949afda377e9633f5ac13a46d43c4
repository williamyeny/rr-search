{"key":"post-6597024","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6597024</id>\n<content>I was going to suggest a second dunk.  When they get done soaking, rinse them under the faucet while rubbing the surface gently with your hands.  This should do enough damage to the surface mycelium to rough it up a bit.  Cakes by definition get overlay, but yours looks too matted to do much.  The scrubbing after the soak should help.  If you have a brand new green scouring pad, buff it gently under water with that too.  It's sort of like the 'scratching' we sometimes do when casing layers become overlayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6597169</next>\n<prev>6596944</prev>\n<first>6596870</first>\n<last>6597197</last>\n<when>1172167527</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 08:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
