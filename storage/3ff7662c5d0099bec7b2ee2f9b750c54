You need to start at page one of this forum and read back every post for 50 pages.  That will take about as long as you've spent asking all these questions, and when you're done reading, you'll have an excellent idea of what growing mushrooms is all about, and where to start.  Good luck to you!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6731928</prev>\n<first>6730475</first>\n<last>6732044</last>\n<when>1175375800</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
