The other half say to spawn to manure. Brf cakes are already 2/3 verm when you make them.  Adding more does nothing but supply moisture, but NO food for the mycelium.  You can easily supply moisture with dunking, so there's no reason to destroy the cake and then make it repair itself for nothing.  Either fruit the cakes as cakes, or crumble and spawn to manure or coir.<br />RR"}}
