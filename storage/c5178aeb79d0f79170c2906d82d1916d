Place the perlite in a strainer and let water run through it from the faucet.  When the perlite has been throughly rinsed, let drain for a minute or two, then dump into your terrarium.  Enough water will be stuck to the perlite to give 99% humidity for three weeks or so. Repeat this process after each flush or two. Standing water of any kind will actually lower humidity.<br />RR"}}
