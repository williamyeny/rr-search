If they say &quot;Well why not buy cow manure?&quot;. I'll just use the four stomachs reason and say it only goes through Mr. Ed once instead of four times. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:smile:&quot; title=&quot;:smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cracks me up.&amp;nbsp; In all the years I've been getting manure from horse farms, not ONCE have they asked me what it's for.&amp;nbsp; Of course it's for my garden!&amp;nbsp; WTF else would it be for?&amp;nbsp; They know you're not going to eat or smoke it. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bagged, composted cow manure from the nursery works great, as I've posted here repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; Mix it half and half with verm by volume, and then toss in a handful or two of gypsum.&amp;nbsp; If you want to grow monsters, toss in up to 5% composted chicken manure by volume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compost from municipal waste is also a good choice as part of the total mix.&amp;nbsp; It's usually grass clippings, tree trimmings, and all the christmas trees they pick up every year, chipped and composted for a couple of years.&amp;nbsp; It's not garbage from the landfill.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10245771</next>\n<prev>10245567</prev>\n<first>10235550</first>\n<last>10248387</last>\n<when>1240887057</when>\n<utime>04/28/09 05:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
