The gas exchange will take the path of least resistance, which is through the holes you drill and the filter.  Rubber side down is great if you're canning fruits and need to pull a vacume, but for mycology it doesn't matter, other than being easier to lift the lids off if the gasket hasn't stuck to the glass.  That's the only reason I put them metal side down.  I've been doing it that way for years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6853263</next>\n<prev>6849364</prev>\n<first>6849256</first>\n<last>6853718</last>\n<when>1177874932</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
