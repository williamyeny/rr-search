{"key":"post-6281852","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6281852</id>\n<content>A bit of serious reading is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, wrong forum so I'll move this to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, NEVER use uncolonized grains so spawn to bulk.  You must wait until full colonization or you are guaranteed to get contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you don't sterilize bulk substrates, you pasteurize them.  Sterilized substrates are much more susceptible to contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, you don't heat treat substrates in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, aluminum foil and/or light will have nothing to do with contamination whether or not light hits your project.  Foil on the sides of a tray will actually increase side pinning by reflecting light down the sides deep into the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, spawning wbs to coir is considered a bulk substrate, not a casing.  The casing is the non-nutritious layer that is placed on TOP of a fully colonized bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, your contamination problem probably would not have occurred had you waited for full colonization of your WBS, and properly pasteurized the coir before spawning to it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6282415</next>\n<prev>6281816</prev>\n<first>6281816</first>\n<last>6282601</last>\n<when>1163523214</when>\n<utime>11/14/06 06:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
