{"key":"post-6445865","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6445865</id>\n<content>I've successfully cloned mushroom tissue that had been dried and bagged up three years earlier, so you tell me if it was 'dead'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also cloned store bought mushrooms several times and had very poor fruitings every time.  It seems that the farms grow their spawn out to the point of senescence before fruiting, so what you get when you clone is old, run out mycelium.  They've fruited, but certainly not in beautiful flushes like my fresh cultures do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6445917</next>\n<prev>6445740</prev>\n<first>6445568</first>\n<last>6445948</last>\n<when>1168472230</when>\n<utime>01/11/07 01:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
