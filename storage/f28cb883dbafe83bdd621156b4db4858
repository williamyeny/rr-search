The heat might be a bit much, and the fan would dry out your straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've fruited them many times on an open shelf in my bedroom by simply wrapping them loosely with plastic sheeting.  Cut a few holes for air exchange and leave it alone except once or twice per day open it up for a good airing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option is a laundry basket of straw.  You can cover them during colonization with a black plastic trash bag with a few small holes punched in, then remove the bag and fruit in the open air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6336916</prev>\n<first>6336916</first>\n<last>6336976</last>\n<when>1165357185</when>\n<utime>12/06/06 12:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
