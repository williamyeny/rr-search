Then, take a tupperware container and put the damprid in the bottom.  Lay a piece of window screen or other material above the damprid and put the mushrooms on top of that.  Seal the lid tightly.  The damprid will draw the moisture that is left in the fruits, leaving them cracker dry.  Don't allow any part of the mushrooms to touch the damprid itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't skip the fan drying stage first.  There is so much water in mushrooms, they will saturate the damprid and rot if you do.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6147019</next>\n<prev>6146940</prev>\n<first>6146940</first>\n<last>25514143</last>\n<when>1160346763</when>\n<utime>10/09/06 01:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
