In reality, it is dispersed all the way through the chamber.  CO2 isn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much heavier than air, with which it mixes.  In addition, we don't fan just to get rid of CO2, which isn't produced nearly as much after full colonization.  We fan to get rid of stale, still air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive pressure is neither desired nor beneficial in a terrarium.  Lots of fresh air and 99% humidity is what you need.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8420011</next>\n<prev>8419958</prev>\n<first>8419958</first>\n<last>8422142</last>\n<when>1211223117</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 09:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
