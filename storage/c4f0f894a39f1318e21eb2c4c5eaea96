If you want to keep the jars, PC them before opening.<br />To keep your filter dry, simply put it on the outside of the metal lid.  Drill three or four 1/16\" holes in the metal lid and put it on first.  I put them rubber side up to make them easier to get off later.  Next put the filter material, then the metal ring.  The 1/16\"(1mm) holes are smaller than the grains, so when you shake, the grains don't contact the filter material.   Cover with foil when you PC, but remove the foil as soon as you remove the jars from the PC.  Wait until the PC has returned to room temperature or nearly so to remove the jars.  The filters will be slightly damp when removed, but will dry out within an hour or two before any contaminants can take advantage of them.   Wet filters are a huge cause of bacterial contamination.<br />RR"}}
