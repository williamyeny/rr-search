Other pinning triggers that are as important as light, if not more so, are full colonization of the substrate, a substrate that can support fruiting which bird seed is poor at all by itself, and a massive increase in air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, your quickest bet to get fruits is to open the top of the bag and add 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; of peat/verm casing mix.  Close the bag loosely, to allow some venting and put it back on the shelf.  Once or twice per day, open the bag and let it get a complete exchange of air. Lightly mist the casing layer when you air out the bag to keep it moist. At this point, I wouldn't see anything to be gained by incubating or otherwise trying to keep the cased wbs in the incubator.   You should see some fruits within ten days or so of adding the casing layer.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5653153</next>\n<prev>5652781</prev>\n<first>5652760</first>\n<last>5653153</last>\n<when>1148145440</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
