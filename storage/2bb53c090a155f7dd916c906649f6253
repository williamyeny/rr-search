The link to shroomtalk had a picture of bacteria growing up out of a contaminated LC.&nbsp; That wasn't a lion's mane fruit, but the new grower mistook it for one.<br />Let's shitcan the hostility folks.&nbsp; New growers are trying to learn and they're going to make mistakes.&nbsp; I can remember when everyone of you shit-talkers were noobs yourselves.&nbsp; Be nice please or don't post.<br />This thread is one more reason I don't recommend LC, and it's not just because it's not noob friendly.&nbsp; It's because there's far better ways to grow mushrooms, and LC is perhaps the slowest method of all to expand mycelium.&nbsp; It's simply a bad idea.<br />RR"}}
