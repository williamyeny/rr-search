'Casing' is the layer we put over the top to provide a micro-climate favorable to fruiting as well as moisture to sustain the flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix the cow manure with the straw, but if it's the bagged manure from a nursery, use no more than just enough to make the straw 'dirty', no more than 10% or so by volume the amount of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll crumble your cakes into the straw, then wait for that to colonize, then add your casing layer.  Do a search for bulk substrates.  That should give a bit more info on procedures.  Also, look up 'pasteurization', as the straw/manure needs to be pasteurized, not sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a first grow, I'd suggest just crumbling your cakes and casing them with 50/50 peat/verm.  After you get a bit of experience, go for the bulk substrates since there's a lot more places to screw up with bulk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5655752</prev>\n<first>5654864</first>\n<last>5655966</last>\n<when>1148233085</when>\n<utime>05/21/06 08:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
