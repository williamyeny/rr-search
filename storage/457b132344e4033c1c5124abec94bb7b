{"key":"post-7848694","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7848694</id>\n<content>Since I didn't see the thread title until you changed it, exactly what did it say before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few points are in order here.  First, nice searching, but don't you think it would be a bit wiser to avoid posting teks until you've done them at least once?  The procedure for getting the respect you crave is to grow some nice flushes, post the pictures, and then explain how you did it and what you used.  It leaves yourself open to criticism when you post lots of questions, and then immediately write a 'tek' regarding what you were just asking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say the above, is because your 'rye tek' is almost word for word my tek, except you got the gypsum part totally wrong.  You would never use 10% gypsum in rye grains.  A tablespoon in the pot of soaking water will do.  Drywall is fine if you can't find the easy way and get a bag of granulated gypsum.  The 'horticultural grade' gypsum I get from the local garden center is waste material and broken pieces from a drywall plant, complete with lots of pieces of white and brown paper.  It works like a charm.  As for using calcium with added 'nutrients' intended for plants, they will have little benefit for fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't finely grind up casing layer ingredients.  The courser it is the better.  It's important for air to be able to penetrate the entire casing layer.  A few small pieces of debris in the peat doesn't hurt a thing.  I never remove them.  That's the reason we pasteurize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, lighten up people, and you too cc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7848783</next>\n<prev>7848640</prev>\n<first>7848080</first>\n<last>7860334</last>\n<when>1199833039</when>\n<utime>01/09/08 12:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
