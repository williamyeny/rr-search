I've proved this time and time again with petri dish tests before and after spraying.  Open a petri for ten seconds before spraying with oust, and it grows all kinds of bacteria.  Open a petri for ten seconds after two oust treatments ten minutes apart, and NO bacteria grows in the petri dish.  Couple an oust treatment like that with what Agar said above, and you'll have pretty good success.  Lysol is a SURFACE disinfectant and does nothing for the air.  Oust is designed to remain as a fog for several minutes, thus sanitizes the air.<br />RR"}}
