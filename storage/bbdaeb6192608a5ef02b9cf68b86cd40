CO2 mixes with the air.  To get rid of it, you exchange the air in the terrarium.  You can't simply drill a hole in the bottom and expect it to run out like water.  CO2 is found high in the atmosphere, not just at the surface.  It's the same in your terrarium.  In a completely airtight container, the CO2 would sink to the bottom.  Such is not the case with our growing containers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7459100</next>\n<prev>7458136</prev>\n<first>7458114</first>\n<last>7460218</last>\n<when>1190897058</when>\n<utime>09/27/07 03:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
