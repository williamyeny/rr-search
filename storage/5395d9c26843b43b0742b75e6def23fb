Just leave it covered with foil until the top is fully colonized.  Then, uncover the foil and replace with a flat sheet of wax paper.  The wax paper will serve as the 'casing' causing a humid microclimate below the paper, while letting light penetrate.  Change the sheet of wax paper for a new one every two to three days.  Don't mist, it isn't necessary with wax paper. Just leave it in place.  The fruits will push the wax paper up as they grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4888446</next>\n<prev>4887959</prev>\n<first>4887823</first>\n<last>5506881</last>\n<when>1131039945</when>\n<utime>11/03/05 07:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
