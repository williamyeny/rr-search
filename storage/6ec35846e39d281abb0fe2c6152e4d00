A terrarium should never sit on the ground or floor.  Mine is raised up, then sits of four 4\" pvc couplings to hold it elevated.  I than put four more 4\" pvc couplings on top of the terrarium, and stack another on top of that one, and do it again with a third.  This makes better use of vertical space.  I'm experimenting with 10 different edibles species in pf cakes now, so have several terrariums filled up all over the house. Some are straight pf tek, others are brf/alder sawdust.<br />RR"}}
