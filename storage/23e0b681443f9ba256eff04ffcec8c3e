With some species, commercial growers report up to a 20% increase in harvests from the addition of gypsum alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vermiculite will help hold water and also tends to stimulate pinning.&amp;nbsp; Just about any substrate but straw can benefit from adding 10% to 50% vermiculite by volume.&amp;nbsp; Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8885869</next>\n<prev>8885730</prev>\n<first>8885730</first>\n<last>8909204</last>\n<when>1220714959</when>\n<utime>09/06/08 06:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
