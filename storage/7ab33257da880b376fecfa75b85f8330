This is a forum for 'Mushroom Cultivation,' not 'Communication Skills.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, that's not the point.&amp;nbsp; The point is by misusing terms, they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; get their point across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone makes a grammar mistake(the original poster spelled it correctly), I don't ignore the post.&amp;nbsp; However, if they post something like &quot;i seen dis shroom in da case dat dont lok rite&quot;, I'm going to ignore it.&amp;nbsp; That's what I meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mycology, the word &lt;i&gt;casing&lt;/i&gt; is a verb, and describes the act of putting a casing layer on a substrate.&amp;nbsp; If used as a &lt;i&gt;noun&lt;/i&gt; it would only describe the top layer placed over the substrate, not the whole thing.&amp;nbsp; The word &lt;i&gt;casing&lt;/i&gt; is not an acceptable method to describe a tray with a fruiting 'whatever' in it because it gives no information on what was used, thus nobody can help the person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When terms get misused repeatedly, it doesn't make them 'accepted', it dumbs down the whole population.&amp;nbsp; Most members here are interested in mycology, and &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; is a way to start because it's so easy to grow, it's almost foolproof.&amp;nbsp; However, many move on to edibles when they tire of tripping after a few times, thus it helps to learn the proper nomenclature from the start.&amp;nbsp; Those who 'only want a few shrooms to trip off with their buddies' don't usually last very long once they realize it's both hard work, and smart work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10183376</next>\n<prev>10183338</prev>\n<first>10179497</first>\n<last>10185390</last>\n<when>1239978563</when>\n<utime>04/17/09 05:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
