By selecting a dozen or so of the best rhizomorphic strains and fruiting each one separately, you can find the super performer that will cover every spot of your casing layer with healthy pins.  It might take hundreds of multispore grows to find that strain, if ever, because multispore inoculated substrates usually end up with only one or two strains by the time they fruit because they've all combined. (anastomosis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means the good fruiting and potent strains combine with the poor fruiting and bunk strains.  You never know what you're going to get.  Isolate on agar, then fruit separately and test each strain.  When you find the best one, you can keep master slants in the refrigerator and grow that isolate forever.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5831356</next>\n<prev>5831131</prev>\n<first>5831095</first>\n<last>11196420</last>\n<when>1152293432</when>\n<utime>07/07/06 08:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
