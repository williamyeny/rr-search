I suspect your uncolonized parts were actually infected with bacterial contamination.&amp;nbsp; A natural barrier such as a competitor fungi or bacteria is the same as the mycelium running up against the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birth the pinning cakes, wash them under the faucet to get any parts that are not fully colonized by &lt;i&gt;mushroom mycelium&lt;/i&gt; off the cakes, and then dunk and roll.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8907130</next>\n<prev>8905493</prev>\n<first>8905387</first>\n<last>8907130</last>\n<when>1221064039</when>\n<utime>09/10/08 07:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
