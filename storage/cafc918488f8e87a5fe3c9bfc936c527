Again like I said, my point isn't appreciated, but in fact the responses I get seem almost political... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh?&amp;nbsp; Vermiculite is composed of minerals from the ground. Why would it be harmful?&amp;nbsp; Everything we eat in some way comes from the ground.&amp;nbsp; You may as well be asking if there are PRECISE SCIENTIFIC studies whether apple or peach trees are absorbing shit from the ground that will be harmful or not. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>14108952</prev>\n<first>14108488</first>\n<last>14110460</last>\n<when>1299979880</when>\n<utime>03/13/11 04:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
