If it's one with a blue dye on the lense to give the 'look' of blue water reflecting the sky, then it will do little for your mushrooms. If it's a triton or another 420nm type tube, it will be better than an incandescent light, but not as good as a natural daylight fluorescent, which puts out light at 6500K.  &lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've put terrariums in a west facing window where they get several minutes of direct sunlight every day and the rest of the day diffused sunlight and this seems to give the most aggressive pinsets.  Second best is natural daylight fluorescent or metal halide, which produce light at the higher(blue) end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use UV lights.  They cause mutations.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6761267</next>\n<prev>6761156</prev>\n<first>6760994</first>\n<last>7330481</last>\n<when>1176059389</when>\n<utime>04/08/07 10:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
