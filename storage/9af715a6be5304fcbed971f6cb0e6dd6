{"key":"post-5681448","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5681448</id>\n<content>I'm curious about something.  If you don't have the ambition to look through a thousand posts to find a good design, how are you going to have the ambition to build something as demanding as a flowhood? That's an observation by the way, not an attack.  There is no easy way to make this hobby work past pf jars.  From there on up, it's hard work and skill, which is what makes it fun due to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5681478</next>\n<prev>5681300</prev>\n<first>5679617</first>\n<last>5683721</last>\n<when>1148781720</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 05:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
