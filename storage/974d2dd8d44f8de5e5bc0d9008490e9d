There really is no such thing as complete sterilization.  When you boil or pc jars for an hour, you're really only giving your substrate a 'window of opportunity' to get colonized before the contaminants that survived the pc cycle get a foothold.  Use as soon as possible.  Leaving the foil on is counter productive.  It causes condensation to get the verm barrier or other filter damp, and a damp filter can easily be colonized right through by contaminants trying to get to your substrate below.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6664814</prev>\n<first>6664814</first>\n<last>6664882</last>\n<when>1173816264</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 11:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
