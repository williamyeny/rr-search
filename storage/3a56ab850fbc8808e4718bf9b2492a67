I think it would REALLY REALLY help me if someone posted some pics of healthy LC, and asls CONTAMED lc... ive seen quite a few pics of healthy lc... but not even one pic of a CONTAMED lc &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've been saying for years, you can't tell a healthy vs contaminated LC by looking.&amp;nbsp; That's why I've advised against making them since this whole LC fad started.&amp;nbsp; Growers are doing themselves a disservice making LC instead of using their spores to inoculate brf or grains, where they'll know in a matter of a week or two if they're contaminated or not.&amp;nbsp; With LC, you wait three or four times that long, and then &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; don't know until you go back to stage one, and inoculate grains or brf with them.&amp;nbsp; LC simply and frankly doesn't make sense. This is why I've never posted an LC from spores tek, and never will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you guys want to take cultivation to the next logical step, learn to do agar work.&amp;nbsp; Then you'll know within days if your spores are good or not, and you can easily isolate healthy mycelium away from molds and bacteria, thereby saving a culture from a dirty print.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9796902</next>\n<prev>9796771</prev>\n<first>9796121</first>\n<last>9805959</last>\n<when>1234657264</when>\n<utime>02/15/09 02:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
