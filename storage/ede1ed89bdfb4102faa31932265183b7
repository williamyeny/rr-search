It only sets people back.  Spores should be proved on the flat plane of a petri dish before being placed into liquid culture for commercial level production.  For the home grower, you're miles ahead inoculating cakes or grains with spores rather than lc which grows at less than half the speed of grains.  You can do g2g with healthy grain jars in half the time you can get an lc ready, and you can tell from the smell if a grain jar is good or not, so there's none of the guessing.<br />Save lc for the commercial guys that have already proved their strains on agar, and use conventional methods if you just want a few mushrooms for home use.  You'll be far ahead.<br />I'm sure there will be a few come in and say 'lc is great' but it's a crapshoot, and luck plays a major part in it.  Learn agar skills and you can easily isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminants.<br />RR"}}
