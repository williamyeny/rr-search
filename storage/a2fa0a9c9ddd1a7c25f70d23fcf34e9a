It doesn't matter if mold spores enter the mini greenhouse/fruiting chamber or not.&amp;nbsp; The mushroom mycelium will eat them for lunch.&amp;nbsp; Many new growers do not realize this, and thus they contaminate their own projects repeatedly, by trying to adapt filtering methods for spawn jars to the growing environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mini-greenhouse has slits cut from floor to ceiling in several places.&amp;nbsp; The more air entering and exiting the better.&amp;nbsp; I run two cool mist humidifiers inside the greenhouse, and these produce plenty of moisture and also swirl the air around inside since there's no tubes or hoses to limit flow.&amp;nbsp; Remember: moving, turbulent fresh air is a pinning trigger for mushrooms and a death blow for molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8565908</next>\n<prev>8565340</prev>\n<first>8562802</first>\n<last>8572634</last>\n<when>1214487885</when>\n<utime>06/26/08 04:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
