My youngest son returned from two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan(Marine Recon) last year safely.&amp;nbsp; I spent nearly every night of those three years sleepless worrying about him.&amp;nbsp; I'm certain that your parents and other loved ones are doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8993533</next>\n<prev>8993368</prev>\n<first>8927071</first>\n<last>11137500</last>\n<when>1222538552</when>\n<utime>09/27/08 09:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
