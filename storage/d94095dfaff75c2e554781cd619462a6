Blood meal might help to heat up a compost pile, but apparently the mushrooms have little use for it when not composted.  For pasteurizing in the pillow case method, I'd suggest about 5% by volume of bagged composted chicken manure from a nursery, or any amount of spent coffee grinds you have.  If you drink coffee, empty your spent grinds every day into a tub where you can spread them out to dry.  Once dry, they won't mold.  This way, when you make up a batch of substrate, you'll have them available.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6682082</next>\n<prev>6681232</prev>\n<first>6681232</first>\n<last>6682969</last>\n<when>1174191901</when>\n<utime>03/18/07 07:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
