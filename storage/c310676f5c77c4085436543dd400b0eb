No, the high humidity hasn't shorted one out yet, but those silly inline switches on the cord don't last long.  It only took a few months for both of them(I run two coolmists due to the large greenhouse) to get corroded enough to stop the unit from running.  It's easy to cut them out and splice the cable back together.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5769888</next>\n<prev>5769366</prev>\n<first>5765393</first>\n<last>5769888</last>\n<when>1150770306</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 05:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
