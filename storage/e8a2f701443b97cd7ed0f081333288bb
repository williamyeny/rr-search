Of course, I had a good teacher on how to make them up, as everyone will soon know. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-007/140471066-colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-007/140471066-thumb_colonizing_jars_on_shelf_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6563510</next>\n<prev>6563083</prev>\n<first>6562359</first>\n<last>15694664</last>\n<when>1171405220</when>\n<utime>02/14/07 12:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
