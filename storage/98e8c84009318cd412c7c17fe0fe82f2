A 100 ohm rheostat should be able to give full speed control, provided you find one rated 4 watts or above.  Don't use the motor speed controller I linked to above on a DC motor.   You could probably run it on a 6 volt battery charger to get half speed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7980590</next>\n<prev>7980275</prev>\n<first>7979783</first>\n<last>7985385</last>\n<when>1202188154</when>\n<utime>02/05/08 07:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
