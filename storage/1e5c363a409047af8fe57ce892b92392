It will feed the mold spores that are naturally going to land on the surface, allowing them to grow and ruin your project.<br />The time to worry about sterile procedure is during your spawn run in jars.  Casing layers that have been properly pasteurized will not contaminate for at least three to four weeks.  If contamination shows up in a properly made 50/50 casing prior to that, it's because your spawn was contaminated.<br />Experimenting is great, but for your first few grows, I'd suggest following the advice of those who have already learned the hard way to follow the established teks to the letter.  Once you have a handle on the life cycle of the fungi, experiment away to your hearts content.<br />RR"}}
