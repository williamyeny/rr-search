They're more trouble than they're worth, and more growers lose their projects due to overheating and the stimulation of thermophilic bacteria and molds in the stale, hot environment than lose them due to lower temps.  In fact, lower temps favor mushroom mycelium over molds, even though the mycelium grows a bit slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can run a small space heater in the area your jars colonize in.  As long as you can get the room air temps to the mid 70's to around 80F, your jars will do fine.  My quart jars of rye colonize in ten days to two weeks at 75F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the US, landlords are required to heat their buildings to 'normal room temperature'.  If yours isn't, call your local housing authority to bitch.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6182544</next>\n<prev>6182404</prev>\n<first>6182282</first>\n<last>6183523</last>\n<when>1161196255</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 09:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
