Drywall literally is CaSO4 (calcium sulfate) or aka Gypsum. You could simply get some from Lowes or a local hardware store, its such crumbly stuff that most places which sell it should have some scraps laying around.</blockquote><br />Of course, for some of us, the nearest Lowes or Home Depot is a three to five hour drive. Yet, I can get <a href=\"http://greenacresgypsum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">80 pound bags of agricultural gypsum for $8</a>, which is twice as much as you'll get in a sheet of drywall, for half the price. For serious growers, it's important to find out where the farmers get bulk minerals in your area. Buy wholesale, not retail.<br />The link above works for those in Eastern Washington State, since it's in Spokane.&nbsp; Find a similar business in your area.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>Supermario420 said:</strong><br /><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://proxy.mind-media.com/proxy.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi1099.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fg387%2FRollingStarz1%2FWood%2F36472_4.jpg\"></blockquote><br />That isn't Tyvek, and if you try to wear that worthless shit while sweeping a floor, you'll sweat like a pig.<br />RR"}}
