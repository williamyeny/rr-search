{"key":"post-6005810","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6005810</id>\n<content>Was the jar overincubated beyond full colonization?  Or incubated at a temperature above 80F?  If so, it's likely just metabolic discharges/staining.  For best results, use your mycelium as soon as the jar is fully colonized.  Also, incubating at over 80F leads to excessive metabolyte production.  It's a stain and not a separate zone of growth, so it doesn't look like a contaminant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6005833</next>\n<prev>6005778</prev>\n<first>6005771</first>\n<last>6006018</last>\n<when>1156815046</when>\n<utime>08/29/06 04:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
