You still need twice as much sawdust by volume as wood chips.  In other words, for a five gallon bucket of chips, you want to mix it with two five gallon buckets of hardwood sawdust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sawdust Supply&lt;/b&gt; in Seattle sells large bags of Alder sawdust for $5. They weigh about 40 lbs or so. I don't know what shipping would be or if they even ship, but if anyone wants to give them a call, their number is 206 622 4321.  They have the very large grain alder sawdust that comes from the large sawmills, and it works great for wood lovers.  Get a bag of wheat bran from your local health food store and mix it in at 10% the amount of the sawdust.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5930276</next>\n<prev>5926339</prev>\n<first>5925394</first>\n<last>18953816</last>\n<when>1154571763</when>\n<utime>08/03/06 05:22 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
