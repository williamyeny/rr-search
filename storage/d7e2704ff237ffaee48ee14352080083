I just don't have time to go through and delete them all.  The problem is over saturation of the substrate, which decreases yields and leads to lots of aborts due to the oversaturation.  That doesn't mean it doesn't work at all, just that there are better methods of hydrating the substrate to the proper level.  Good luck to you!<br />RR"}}
