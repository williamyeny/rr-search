An increase in air exchange instead of just gas exchange, which suddenly lowers the CO2 levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Steady, slow evaporation of moisture from the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humidity will aid in primordia formation for the reason that they won't form in very dry air, but it's not really a pinning &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt;, per se, but more of a 'helper'.  If it were an actual trigger, they'd pin in the jars because that's where humidity is highest.  Number 3 above indicates a high humidity or the moisture would be evaporating very fast, rather than slowly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6241794</next>\n<prev>6239586</prev>\n<first>6238733</first>\n<last>6241794</last>\n<when>1162529761</when>\n<utime>11/03/06 06:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
