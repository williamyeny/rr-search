I'd suggest tossing those out and starting over.  Bacterial contamination is the most likely culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 1/2&quot; hole in the lid is way too much for a small jar.  In fact, with quart jars, I only use three to four 1/16&quot; holes for gas exchange.  A large hole will not only dry out your grains, but can lead to pinning before full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start over, and pay very close attention to the moisture content of your grains prior to loading the jars.  1/2 pints are great for the pf tek, but also not well suited for grains.  At the minimum get 1 pint jars, but I suggest using quarts.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6458346</next>\n<prev>6458043</prev>\n<first>6454839</first>\n<last>6459202</last>\n<when>1168795124</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 07:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
