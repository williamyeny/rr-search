A humidifier will either flood your substrates, or dry them out, depending on how accurate of a cycle timer you buy, and how much time you're willing to spend babysitting it.  Holes for FAE and perlite will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no such thing as 'fire and forget it' with mushroom growing.  You need to check daily, mist, and inspect for contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms NEED LIGHT for more than direction.  I get more and more disgusted with the misinformation that gets passed off as advice, when the correct knowledge has been posted repeatedly, and should be well known by now.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6972908</next>\n<prev>6970290</prev>\n<first>6969876</first>\n<last>6973182</last>\n<when>1180232000</when>\n<utime>05/27/07 05:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
