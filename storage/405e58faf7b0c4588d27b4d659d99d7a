{"key":"post-6570451","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6570451</id>\n<content>It's almost a miracle to have ANY pins five days post colonization.  You should really have given these last five days to allow the mycelium to consolidate its hold on the substrate before placing in fruiting conditions.  No, don't pick the pins.  Keep up FAE and keep humidity near 100%.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6570477</next>\n<prev>6570441</prev>\n<first>6570441</first>\n<last>6570499</last>\n<when>1171564395</when>\n<utime>02/15/07 08:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
