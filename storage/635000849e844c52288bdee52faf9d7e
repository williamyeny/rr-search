Straw fruits best uncased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never add a casing layer after pinning starts.  It leads to contamination under the casing layer, and also causes the pins that have formed to abort in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6844384</next>\n<prev>6843541</prev>\n<first>6730011</first>\n<last>6844384</last>\n<when>1177767098</when>\n<utime>04/28/07 04:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
