It gives the mycelium and uncolonized grains a greasy, or sometimes a 'melted ice cream' look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you go to break up a grain jar that has bacteria, it will be much harder to separate the kernels.  Banging a contaminant free jar against a tire a few times will usually separate all the kernels individually.  If you bang a contaminated(bacteria) jar against a tire, the contents will stay as one large lump.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6091882</prev>\n<first>6091474</first>\n<last>6092625</last>\n<when>1159018974</when>\n<utime>09/23/06 04:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
