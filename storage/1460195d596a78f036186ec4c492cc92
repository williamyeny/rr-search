(Volts, Direct Current).&nbsp; If you hook it up to that AC transformer, you'll melt something and/or fry the motor.<br />In addition, never plug anything with metal on it into a wall socket without a ground connected.&nbsp; The ground(green) wire on your cord connects to all the metal parts to discharge any shorts directly to ground, thus tripping the circuit breaker.<br />However, you can't run a DC motor on AC current.&nbsp; It's that simple.<br />RR"}}
