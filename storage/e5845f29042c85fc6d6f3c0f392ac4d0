Actually, they're probably fruit flies, but they rarely breed or lay eggs in our projects.   They're atrracted to the smell of the mycelium for a snack.  Don't worry though, they're small and don't eat much.   I've never had a contamination I could blame on them and I live in fruit fly heaven.  You can suck them out of your chambers with the vacuum cleaner hose.  It's kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6003060</next>\n<prev>6002926</prev>\n<first>5995251</first>\n<last>8586552</last>\n<when>1156733467</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 05:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
