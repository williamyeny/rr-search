{"key":"post-7831660","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7831660</id>\n<content>For grain jars, I prefer synthetic filter disks, but I don't inoculate grain jars with syringes anyway.  If you do, micropore tape works.  I suggest putting a piece of tape on both the inside and outside of the lid, and then after syringe inoculation, place a third piece of tape over the damaged tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've made quite a few pf and rye grain jars this way to test the tek, and I really wish I had included it on the DVD.  It will be on the next one for sure.  It really does make the dry verm barrier obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7831696</next>\n<prev>7831287</prev>\n<first>7830823</first>\n<last>7831745</last>\n<when>1199471654</when>\n<utime>01/04/08 08:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
