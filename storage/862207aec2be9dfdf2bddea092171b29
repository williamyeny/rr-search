{"key":"post-6344609","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6344609</id>\n<content>A glovebox is not advanced equipment.  One can be made free with stuff around the house, so there's no need for people to work in open air or fecal and mold infested bathrooms and kitchens.  There is also no way to generate 100 full syringes of liquid mycelium in very small pieces within two weeks from injecting spores into honey or karo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure if people blindly used the grain method I described above, many would still have problems too, because they're inserting unproved and possibly contaminated spore solution into grains, which also isn't proper mycological technique.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, agar can easily be poured in a glovebox, and the petri dishes used to isolate healthy mushroom mycelium away from any contaminants in less time than it takes to even know if a karo LC is contaminated or not.  That agar wedge can then be used to inoculate the quart(or pint) jar of grains, that can then be turned into at least 100 syringes, or used for g2g transfer to get ten jars the old standard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, after the water is poured out of the grain jar, it can be placed back on the shelf to re-colonize, and the process can be repeated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just strongly feel new growers are doing themselves a disservice when they simply inject spores into honey water and then sit there waiting for something to happen.  At the very least, inject directly to grains so you can visually inspect the process.  Perhaps Agar's lids with injection ports will help those who have never used grains to get off to a good start.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6344633</next>\n<prev>6344556</prev>\n<first>6343358</first>\n<last>27872587</last>\n<when>1165523138</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 10:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
