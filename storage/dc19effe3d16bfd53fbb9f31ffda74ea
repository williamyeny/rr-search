I've been recommending this technique for well over a year now.  I got tired of ruining coolmists by forcing them to produce static pressure that forces moisture into the bushings, which ruins them and burns out the motor.  Then, you can't return it for credit because it's been modified.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only looking for a way to be able to return them for credit when they shit the bed.  Low and behold, I'm still running the original, and no longer have a pile of old coolmists laying around.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5874900</next>\n<prev>5874593</prev>\n<first>5873249</first>\n<last>5950625</last>\n<when>1153271942</when>\n<utime>07/19/06 04:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
