People use the wrong terminology too often and that leads to confusion.  Coir is a substrate material just like manure. Colonized grains used as you did are a 'spawn', not a substrate. You put a substrate material over colonized spawn, then exposed to fruiting conditions when the substrate was only partially colonized, treating the substrate as if it were a casing.  Now you do have overlay because it dried out before it could fruit.<br />I'd suggest putting that tray into the sink and allowing the faucet to run gently for a few hours, allowing the tray to fill up with water so the water runs over the edge and down the drain. If necessary, weight down the substrate with whatever you have to keep it submerged. After a few hours, dump out the water and return to fruiting conditions.  Since you're now trying to fruit an uncased substrate, lay a sheet of wax paper over the top of the tray to hold humidity at the surface of your substrate to near 100%.  Lift it up several times a day to fan out the top, then replace the wax paper.  Hopefully, it will pin in a few days if you'll do the above.<br />This is why I've tried for years to correct people when they refer to their project as a 'casing'.  It makes me want to scream because the casing is only the top non-nutritive layer, such as peat/verm, which you didn't even use.  'Casing' is NOT a term to use for a substrate, spawn, tray, bulk project or anything else except the <i>casing <u>layer</u></i>.<br />RR"}}
