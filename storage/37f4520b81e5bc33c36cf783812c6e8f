There are many molds that can ruin our spawn, Dactylium being only one of them and not all that common.  If you have a darker color at the edges, and especially if there is a line of demarcation between the growths, then one or the other is mold, so toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6641804</prev>\n<first>6641804</first>\n<last>6641923</last>\n<when>1173220026</when>\n<utime>03/07/07 12:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
