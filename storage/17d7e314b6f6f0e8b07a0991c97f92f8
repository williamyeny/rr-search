If you look at the what it should look like guide, in the agar section there's a lot of pictures of people using pins to start off and then just cut off their sector. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloning a fast growing pin is the quickest and safest way to clone.&amp;nbsp; It' far better than cutting into a mature fruit later. Simply lay the pin on top of the agar and wait for the mycelium to grow, and then grab a tiny piece of the leading edge and transfer to a new dish.&amp;nbsp; Since pins are growing so fast, they outrun the competition and allow you to grab a clean culture after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;250ml of agar isn't going to be enough for 20 dishes.&amp;nbsp; You'll need twice that to get the film thick enough to support growth without drying out.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18523609</next>\n<prev>18523327</prev>\n<first>18523154</first>\n<last>22645627</last>\n<when>1373191221</when>\n<utime>07/07/13 01:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
