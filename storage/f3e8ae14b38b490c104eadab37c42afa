{"key":"post-6853111","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6853111</id>\n<content>Home wrap is the wrong form of tyvek to use for jar filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't ask the employees at Lowes or home depot.  They don't know.  Go to the paint department and look at the coveralls.  Chances are, they'll say tyvek on the label.  Another source is tyvek wrist sleeves.  Both are available online by searching for 'tyvek coveralls' or 'tyvek wrist sleeves'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6853151</next>\n<prev>6852759</prev>\n<first>6852101</first>\n<last>6853151</last>\n<when>1177947050</when>\n<utime>04/30/07 06:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
