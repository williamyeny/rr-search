See I just threw a shirt over 1 of my FC's cause I was lazy lastnight + fell asleep early so light was entering the bottom sides, woke up to fruits growing downwards lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, they don't triple in size.&amp;nbsp; They may expand by that much, but they'll be skinny and not weigh much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms are phototropic in that they'll orient toward light.&amp;nbsp; That's so they can absorb what I'll call &lt;i&gt;'energy'&lt;/i&gt; out of lack of a better term.&amp;nbsp; Give proper light during growth, and you'll have fat, meaty, heavy fruits.&amp;nbsp; Grow in less than enough light and you'll have thin and light fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those PE on the disk cover were on an upper shelf while a different type of grow was happening with MH lamps below.&amp;nbsp; They turned away from my weenie headed 6500K fluorescent and began growing towards the MH. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:laugh:&quot; title=&quot;:laugh:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19293949</next>\n<prev>19293918</prev>\n<first>19293619</first>\n<last>19294164</last>\n<when>1387407706</when>\n<utime>12/19/13 01:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
