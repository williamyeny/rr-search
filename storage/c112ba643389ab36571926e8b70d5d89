Mushrooms often pin on the bottoms of cakes because the moisture from above runs to the bottom due to gravity.  That's why it's a good idea to pile up a tablespoon or two of verm on top of a cake and keep that soaked.  It makes sort of a moisture reservoir up on top of the cake.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7692394</next>\n<prev>7692365</prev>\n<first>7691999</first>\n<last>7693996</last>\n<when>1196304946</when>\n<utime>11/29/07 04:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
