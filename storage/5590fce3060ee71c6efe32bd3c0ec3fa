You didn't say what the substrate was, if it was cased or not, how it was prepared, what sort of gas/air exchange was provided, how old the culture is, what the temperature/light cycles have been, if there are any smells or discolorations, or anything else that can help to give a diagnosis.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have your friend get all of the above information together and we'll see what we can do.  Until then, nobody can help.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6262072</next>\n<prev>6261620</prev>\n<first>6261407</first>\n<last>6262381</last>\n<when>1163015607</when>\n<utime>11/08/06 09:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
