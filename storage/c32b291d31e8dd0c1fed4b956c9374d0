Air doesn't get over-saturated because excess moisture falls to the ground. However, fruiting chambers don't rain.<br />In addition, the problem of the original poster is substrate moisture content, not humidity.&nbsp; If it's too low or too high you'll get small fruits which open their caps early.&nbsp; Lift the tray up so you can judge from weight if it's too dry or wet.&nbsp; I suspect too dry.&nbsp; You'd know if the substrate was too wet because the fruits would be waterlogged and heavy, even though they're small.<br />RR"}}
