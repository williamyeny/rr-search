It looks fixed, except for being able to raise up and down for focus. If not, it means you would have to push your slide around under the lense by hand.  That would be nearly impossible to position properly at high magnification.  The slightest touch would send your object out of view.  You want to make sure anything you get has two knobs on the stage.  One for moving it left and right, and one for moving it forward and back.  A third knob moves it up and down for focus.  Make sure it also has a fine and course focus knob or it's a real pita to adjust.  Personally, I think you can get more scope for your money, even if you gotta drop a bit more cash.<br />RR"}}
