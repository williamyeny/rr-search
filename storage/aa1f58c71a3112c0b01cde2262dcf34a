There may be more involved as well, but fungi hasn't commanded the level of scientific study that plants have. What we do know is that bright light in the 6500 Kelvin color temperature range in a normal day/night routine will produce more mushrooms and they will be larger, better developed mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11970823</prev>\n<first>11965043</first>\n<last>11971653</last>\n<when>1265423301</when>\n<utime>02/06/10 04:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
