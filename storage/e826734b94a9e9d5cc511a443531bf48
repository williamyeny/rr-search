I doubt it will recover and most likely will turn green soon.  Next time, do everything except using the uncolonized wbs and an open oven.  The oven tek is bogus.  The convection and turbulence caused by an open oven door actually increases airflow in the area, therefore increasing your chances of contamination.  Work in a glovebox or clean room.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6295890</next>\n<prev>6295749</prev>\n<first>6295656</first>\n<last>6295890</last>\n<when>1163835791</when>\n<utime>11/18/06 09:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
