Now I get tiny puffs and the occasional green fleck that I don't catch until the color change, starting at the 3rd flush. Sometimes 2nd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like you need to work on lining up your pinning triggers. If you do everything right, you should get 80% to 90% or so of your total possible product in the first two flushes.&amp;nbsp; I never go for a third flush indoors, and usually move substrates outdoors after 1st flush.&amp;nbsp; By then the mycelium is spent and it's normal for molds to move in.&amp;nbsp; If it's taking more than two flushes to get to that point, work on fruiting parameters.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14794589</next>\n<prev>14776711</prev>\n<first>14776371</first>\n<last>14794589</last>\n<when>1310852810</when>\n<utime>07/17/11 12:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
