The requirements of the National Organic Program will apply to the sale of all organic products in Arizona. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does this not surprise me? &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot; title=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the USDA requires that if you're going to call your product organic, it must be &lt;i&gt;certified by a third party&lt;/i&gt;, usually a State Department of Agriculture.&amp;nbsp; You can't just follow the 'farming' part of the guidelines and use the word &lt;i&gt;organic&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That puts you in a tight spot because to use the word 'organic' you have to be certified, which means a paperwork trail and inspections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arizona might not give a shit about healthy stuff like organic farming, but the feds do, at least until the opposing party comes back to power, at which time the farm-subsidy sucking corporate mega-farms will once again control the USDA.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14328979</next>\n<prev>14328694</prev>\n<first>14328213</first>\n<last>14534207</last>\n<when>1303428232</when>\n<utime>04/22/11 02:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
