Stale air does not exist - just have a look at my calculations a few posts above and you will see the average velocity of an oxygen and a carbondioxide molecule respectively for 75Â°F. That is why we have air pressure. By fanning you do actually not increase the average speed of your gas molecules much - you only lead them into one direction. &lt;br /&gt;Thus as long as you have one large or several small holes in your FC, you will be fine with FAE. The amount of air exchanged per unit time depends mainly on the size of the area fresh air can enter in. &lt;br /&gt;If you use fans you only move larger particles around like mold spores - your mycelium does not actually get much more oxygen to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and if you don't have any fans in say a basement for example it can definitely make it easier for mold to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Concerning mold spores there is one major difference between using a fan and not using one. In the first case you move them around your FC - in the second most of them just drop to the ground. &lt;br /&gt;Why does the latter increase your contamination rate? &lt;br /&gt;Of course you should make sure fresh air can enter your FC from the outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just gotta make sure the fans not blowing directly at it. In commercial mushroom operations they usually have fans for exhaust so you want some air circulation in the same room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In commercial mushroom operations they filter the air to the FC, however. That makes a huge difference since you thus decrease the area fresh air can enter through. In order to cope with that you need to create a positive or negative pressure environment in your FC in order to force osmosis through your HEPA filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't begin to address all the mistakes you've made in that post.&amp;nbsp; There is stale air in non-properly built fruiting areas.&amp;nbsp; Circulation helps prevent contaminant spores from germinating because molds prefer still, stale air.&amp;nbsp; One or two holes in a terrarium isn't going to cut it. Osmosis and HEPA filters have nothing to do with each other, and in my commercial mushroom farm, there is no filter on the intake and less than one substrate in 1000 ever gets mold.&amp;nbsp; Mold spores don't drop to the ground, they float on the natural air currents, since air is rarely completely still.&amp;nbsp; Air pressure is not caused by velocity, but by rather by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on, but please learn a bit about mushrooms and science before giving bad advice to others and stating it as fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14494449</next>\n<prev>14492765</prev>\n<first>14481633</first>\n<last>14494449</last>\n<when>1306073279</when>\n<utime>05/22/11 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
