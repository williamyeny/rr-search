However, you still need a substrate that can support the requirements of the mycelium.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make an analogy to humans, there's nothing you could feed pee-wee herman to make him look like a gladiator.  By the same token, if you took the child of two athletes and fed him nothing but beans and white bread, he would grow up to resemble pee-wee much more than an athlete.   So, you need the genetics, AND the food to fuel them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I've noticed no difference in potency from my isolated strains when grown on any of the common substrate materials such as straw, coir, manure, coffee, brf, etc.  They're all good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6516052</next>\n<prev>6515443</prev>\n<first>6511652</first>\n<last>6516052</last>\n<when>1170259256</when>\n<utime>01/31/07 06:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
