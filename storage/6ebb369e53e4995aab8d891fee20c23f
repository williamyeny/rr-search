It mixes with the air and raises the CO2 content.  CO2 can be measured in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.  If it all settled to the bottom(ground) it would snuff out life on earth.   Therefore, you can't drain CO2 out of your terrarium by holes on the bottom.<br />Fans in a small terrarium will dry out the air.  That's why your current cakes are blue.  They're dry and stressing.  You want natural circulation in your FC, near 100% humidity, and enough holes or fanning by hand to get the CO2 out.<br />RR"}}
