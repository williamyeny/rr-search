The condensation will always form on the warm side when there's a temperature differential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never see condensation on the walls of a shotgun terrarium.&amp;nbsp; The airflow prevents a temperature differential, so even at 100% humidity, a shotgun terrarium will have no condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a high elevation, very dry climate.&amp;nbsp; My shotgun terrariums are always in the mid to upper 90% range.&amp;nbsp; It's also important to remember that when it comes to growing mushrooms, fresh air and light are more important than high humidity.&amp;nbsp; In addition, nearly all complaints we see here regarding low humidity turn out to be faulty hygrometers.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13848978</next>\n<prev>13832273</prev>\n<first>13829184</first>\n<last>13848978</last>\n<when>1295759882</when>\n<utime>01/23/11 07:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
