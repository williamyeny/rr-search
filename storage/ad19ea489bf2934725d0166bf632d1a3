Only thing about light that matters is the blue 6500k color, and lumens hardly matter. The difference between 1000 lumens and 2000 lumens is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of bad info that gets vomited out time after time around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intensity matters a great deal.&amp;nbsp; That's why outdoor cubes are often several times larger than we grow indoors.&amp;nbsp; However, lumens isn't a measure of light intensity, so we use lux which is one lumen spread over one square meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody can give a lux figure for best performance because other factors come into play such as the beam angle and the amount of light reflected or absorbed by the terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6500K is also not a wavelength, bandwidth, frequency, etc., of light.&amp;nbsp; It's only a rough guide on the &lt;i&gt;combined color&lt;/i&gt; the light appears to our eyes or our camera lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, just experiment to find the best performance at a price you can afford.&amp;nbsp; Bright is better so disregard those who would say mushrooms don't photosynthesize therefore don't need bright light.&amp;nbsp; That's akin to saying a diesel truck can't drive down the road because it doesn't burn gasoline.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19926250</next>\n<prev>19925249</prev>\n<first>18373016</first>\n<last>20237703</last>\n<when>1398951258</when>\n<utime>05/01/14 04:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
