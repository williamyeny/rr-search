I always do as you did, spawning into a bulk substrate.  My pinsets have been better after pasteurization, as opposed to sterilized casing material.  Just an observation.  It's good to see folks experimenting.  So many seem to think the first thing they try is the 'only' way to do things.  Keep up the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it just occured to me that I might have made it seem that I don't incubate bulk substrate trays.  I do.   What I was saying above is that I don't incubate 'again' after the casing layer goes on. I prefer the casing to not colonize completely.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>2522616</next>\n<prev>2521838</prev>\n<first>2480695</first>\n<last>23893521</last>\n<when>1081039199</when>\n<utime>04/04/04 03:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
