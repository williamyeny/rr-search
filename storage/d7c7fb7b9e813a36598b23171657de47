I fail to see the reasoning in spending several days working on something that is more likely than not to fail in order to save a few bucks on a used pressure cooker at goodwill, craigslist, salvation army, etc.  Rye and other grains are not cheap.  You can easily loose enough grains and spores to equal the price of a used pressure cooker on your first grow.  Do it right and save yourself a lot of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5656524</next>\n<prev>5655322</prev>\n<first>5654497</first>\n<last>5656524</last>\n<when>1148225764</when>\n<utime>05/21/06 06:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
