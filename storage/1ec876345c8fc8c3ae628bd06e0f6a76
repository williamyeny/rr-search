Yes it's a SGFC maybe 20 qt capacity? I can fit 8 cakes comfortably atop 6 inches perlite. been using a fan to dry fruits in the same room as growing, when i do my 4-6 FAE's each day, I just hold the fan over the terrarium or set it on top to blow air down for 30 seconds or so. I mist 3 times a day every 6-8 hours or so. Thanks y'all, whaddya think?</blockquote><br />I can't count the number of times I've posted that you should NEVER run a fan in the same room as a shotgun terrarium.<br />Search amazon.de for a fischer hair hygrometer and order one.&nbsp; They're about the only thing that is dependable.<br />RR"}}
