I know of no commercial mushroom farms other than those growing 'white button' mushrooms that don't use bright, high frequency lighting, with one notable exception being King oyster farms, where dim lighting produces smaller caps and large, fat stems, which are desired with that species. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most agaricus species require little to no light to grow to full size.&amp;nbsp; Others, such as all the edibles and medicinals as well as the psilocybe mushrooms that people around here grow, require light to produce the best quality and most product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple surf around this board if you've been gone for a few years is to look at average flushes people are getting today compared to several years ago.&amp;nbsp; The difference is air exchange and lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't confuse mushrooms and plants.&amp;nbsp; Each uses light in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13148022</next>\n<prev>13147804</prev>\n<first>13085841</first>\n<last>13149636</last>\n<when>1283646587</when>\n<utime>09/05/10 03:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
