The dry air outside the chamber will literally suck the moisture out of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan is exactly the reason why you would need to plug the holes with polyfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &quot;hole plugging&quot; would allow you to increase the humidity inside your tub while allowing the &quot; increased &lt;u&gt;FAE&lt;/u&gt; &quot; he was referring to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in an area where open holes dry substrates out in the winter. I don't grow with a shotgun terrarium. I grow on bulk substrates. However, if I did use a shotgun terrarium in my oil heated house, in an already cold-dry climate where my knuckles crack from the low RH I would be plugging my holes with a box fan in the room on low. Keep in my there is more than one way to skin a cat.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, you don't plug holes so you can run a fan in the room against recommendations. When I say it's best not to let the humidity drop below 35%, that's referring to ambient humidity. For those of us who live in extremely dry winter climates, it's important to run a humidifier indoors during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, and the shotgun terrarium is designed to operate on ambient currents within a room, not on a fan induced windstorm.&amp;nbsp; Plugging holes stops this natural process and lowers humidity.&amp;nbsp; Run a humidifier in the winter indoors, and mist as required to replace lost moisture.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13927314</next>\n<prev>13926951</prev>\n<first>13925623</first>\n<last>13928230</last>\n<when>1297195642</when>\n<utime>02/08/11 10:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
