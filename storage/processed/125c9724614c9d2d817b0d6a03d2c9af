Remember, a 1/2\" hole is four times the size of a 1/4\" hole, so if you use a larger bit, make far fewer holes.  The best way to calibrate a hygrometer is to wrap it up in a wet bath towel for an hour, and then unwrap and adjust so it reads 99%.<br />I've long recommended those in very dry or desert climates to run a cool mist humidifier in the room the terrarium is located.  You don't have to pipe it in, just run it in the room to raise the ambient humidity to 50% or higher, and your terrarium will easily maintain mid to upper nineties.<br />Also, make sure your perlite isn't packed down tight.  If it is, it can't work.  Rake your fingers through it from top to bottom to fluff it up.  You want your perlite very loose and airy so it can evaporate the moisture it holds into the air.  The more surface area of perlite, the better it works.  Make little mountains and valleys for best results.<br />RR","title":"Re: Now I know what all the fuss is about..."}}
