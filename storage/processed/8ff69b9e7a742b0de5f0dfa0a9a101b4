Spawn outdoor woodchip beds in the spring after last frost.  I start my grains in December, and use them to inoculate sawdust/woodchip bags in January.  Give the sawdust/woodchip bags two months to colonize fully, and then use them to spawn to moistened woodchips in an outdoor bed in March.  Cover with an inch of topsoil, and a bit of straw or cardboard to protect against any late freezes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Outdoor beds"}}
