They do not abort, rather the tiny veil breaks and the fruit has reached \"maturity\" at barely a centimeter long! This is uncool. Like I said these have been in fruiting mode for 3 and 4 weeks, so they are looking old. I will prolly chuck em out today (gotta make room for nice bright white cakes that are already pinning!), but just wondered if anyone else has encountered this issue or knew what it might be. Thanks!</blockquote><br />Substrate moisture management is the problem here.&nbsp; A cake or other substrate which is too wet or too dry will cause the same phenomenon you're describing.&nbsp; Lift your cakes so you can tell by the weight if they're too wet or too dry.&nbsp; With experience, you'll learn to 'read' the cakes without having to lift them to compare with original weight.<br />RR","title":"Re: Crappy pins open too early"}}
