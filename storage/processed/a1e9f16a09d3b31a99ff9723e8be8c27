'Sterilization' is never complete, but only gives a window of opportunity to get the grains colonized.  Wait until the jars return to room temperature, and then inoculate.<br />Glass is an insulator, so if they were even slightly warm on the outside of the glass, your spores are probably cooked and doomed.
