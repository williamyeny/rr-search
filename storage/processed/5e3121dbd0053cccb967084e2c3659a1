Digital ones are crap, regardless of cost.  Calibrate it when new, and again at least every two weeks.  Mechanical ones have an adjusting screw on back.  You can search for the procedure using my name and 'calibrate hygrometer' as the search words.<br />In addition, fill up all the empty shelf and floor space with trays of damp perlite.  These will catch drips and return them to the air as humidity.  As said above, a full greenhouse is easier to maintain humidity than an empty one.  The trays of damp perlite on the empty shelves and floor make up the difference.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bulk Substrate + Greenhouse Woes"}}
