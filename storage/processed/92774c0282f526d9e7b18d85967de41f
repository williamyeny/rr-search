That's the problem with making liquid culture from unproved mycelium or spores.  You might be wasting a lot of time on the LC when you could be growing mushrooms.<br />If you have growth in less than two days that is visible to the naked eye, chances are much greater that it's mold then mushroom mycelium which is much slower.
