This causes a loss of moisture from the substrate, which is the main pinning trigger.&nbsp; It simply means everything is working correctly.<br />You can obtain CO2 detectors to verify your fresh air exchange.&nbsp; Shoot for a level less than 1000 ppm during fruiting if you're making changes, or trying to set up a new design.&nbsp; Otherwise, just <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">follow the tek</a> and your CO2 levels will be in the 500 ppm to 1000 ppm range.<br />RR","title":"Re: Re-moisturizing pearlite in a shotgun FC"}}
