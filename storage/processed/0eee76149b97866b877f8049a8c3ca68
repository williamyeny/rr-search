You should be able to let the PC cool overnight to room temperature, then have the grains completely loose in the jar with no shaking.  Just turning a jar upside down should be enough to separate the kernels. <br />If not, you need to rinse the grains before preparing, and add gypsum when placing in the jars.  Make sure the grains are dry on the outside(surface) when you load your jars.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Easy \"Soak and Simmer\" WBS Prep"}}
