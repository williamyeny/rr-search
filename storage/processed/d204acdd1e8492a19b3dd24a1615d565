It's not to save energy or protect the environment. It's so the government can spy on you.<br />All new fluorescent light bulbs have microchips, microphones and even microcameras implanted inside them. These devices record audio and/or video whenever a key word is spoken during a conversation or whenever a large movement occurs in a room.\" <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/mushroom2.gif\" alt=\":mushroom2:\" title=\":mushroom2:\"/> </blockquote><br />Who the hell do you think is going to buy into that crap?&nbsp; That's just plain bullshit. If the government wants to tap your phone or bug your house, they'll do it.&nbsp; However, they don't bug fluorescent lights sold in stores to spy on people. <br />CFLs use a tiny fraction of the electricity an incandescent bulb uses to produce the same amount of light.&nbsp; If you buy a CFL for mushroom growing, look for one that says 6,500 K on the packaging.<br />RR","title":"Re: regular ol' light work alright until I get more money?"}}
