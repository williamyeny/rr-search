It is of little use to fungi unless composted.  Coir is fine by itself, or you can mix in coffee grinds, worm castings, horse manure, etc.   Inoculate the coir with your spawn, leaving 1\" at the top of the container.  When the coir is fully colonized, place 1/2\" of pasteurized peat/verm on top as a casing.  When the mycelium breaks through the top, introduce to fruiting conditions.  You can read up on 'patching', but it's an optional procedure.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Next step up from BRF 50/50 in greenhouse"}}
