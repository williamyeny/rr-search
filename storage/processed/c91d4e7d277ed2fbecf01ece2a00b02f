Pinsets and eventual harvests are better with a properly made and maintained casing layer however. It's generally best not to apply a casing layer after pinning has started.  Even if the pins are only in one spot, the entire mycelial network functions as a coherent organism, so it should be pinning everywhere soon.<br />RR","title":"Re: Premature pinning"}}
