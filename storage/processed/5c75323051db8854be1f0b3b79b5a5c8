Make up a fresh batch and start over.  Don't use an incubator next time and keep the jars at 75F to 80F on a shelf so they get air.  The biggest cause of stalled jars is running out of air, and the second is bacterial contamination which is increased exponentially by keeping in a sealed box at high temperature.  There is ZERO increase in rate of growth above 80F, and it falls off rapidly shortly after that.<br />RR","title":"Re: Slow colonization?"}}
