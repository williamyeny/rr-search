If you want to discuss strains, use the strain thread at the top of the page.&nbsp; You won't find any experienced growers telling you any 'strain' is more potent than any other, nor will you find any experienced growers telling you one substrate will deliver more potency than another.&nbsp; The reason for switching to grains and bulk substrate is for volume, not quality.<br />RR","title":"Re: Substrates & Strain"}}
