You'd be far better to listen and learn.  I won't endlessly repeat what I've previously typed.  Do it your way, and then when it doesn't work, listen to the advice of those who have come before you.  Perlite does not form into a sponge like material, vermiculite does.  Vermiculite absorbs water, perlite does not.  Perlite works by having a very large surface area, to which the water sticks and than evaporates off.  The water does not penetrate the perlite.<br />Moisture will evaporate just fine from perlite at room temperature, and three to five inches of rinsed, and then well drained perlite in a tub will maintain humidity for six to eight weeks, sometimes longer without adding more moisture.<br />RR","title":"Re: Summer / Humidity"}}
