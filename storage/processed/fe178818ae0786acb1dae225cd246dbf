Using more spores is counterproductive.  I agree they will 'colonize' faster by using more spores, but the problem is that not all strains are going to be compatible, therefore by using an excess of spores, an excess of strains are going to be created, some of which won't unite to form a common whole.  The result is you have several separate mycelial networks, none of which has access to the total amount of food(BRF) in the cake.<br />The best fruiting results from multispore inoculation comes from using minimum spores.  Even better, a single sector strain you've isolated on agar in a petri dish.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is over inoculation good?"}}
