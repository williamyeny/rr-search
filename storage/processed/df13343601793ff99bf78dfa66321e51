Any casing that isn't held to the substrate by the mycelium gets washed away by the kitchen faucet.  There's usually a bunch of holes in the casing layer anyway from picking the flush.  Add fresh casing material to the divets and to replace what washes off.  What I've found is that over time, it's the casing layer that will contaminate, not the substrate itself.  By replacing the outer layer of the casing between flushes, you get rid of the trich spores that have landed on it.  It definitely doesn't slow down the next flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: re-case after first dunk/flush?"}}
