The weight and density causes the brf to pack down tight near the bottom and that part doesn't colonize.  Stick to 1/2 pints and stack them later after colonzation if you want a larger substrate.  Pints work, but not as well as halfs, and certainly not as well as two 1/2 pints stacked.<br />When not using the pressure cooker, I steam 1/2 pints for 90 minutes.  It doesn't overcook them by any means, and it insures the mold spores and bacteria have been executed.<br />RR","title":"Re: how long to steam full quarts?"}}
