Pick respected members and take what they say to heart.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />After a flush, when there are a bunch of ready shrooms, and then a lot of pins... do you take EVERYTHING, or just those that are ready, or near ready? </blockquote><br />You pick the fruits that are ready to pick and leave the pins.  The easiest way to re-hydrate a bulk substrate that is dry is to pour water around the edges of the tray so that the substrate floats a bit.  Leave it overnight and pour off the excess water.  Mist the casing layer well.  Never pick the pins because it's common with many species to set pins for the first few flushes at the time of first flush.  These pins remain dormant until their turn comes.  If you pick them, you ruin future harvests.<br />Lead should never be used near food.  Use a rock or something non-toxic.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cornfused. :("}}
