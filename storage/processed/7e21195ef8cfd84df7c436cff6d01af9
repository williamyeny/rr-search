Crubling and casing seems to give one nice big flush, while cakes will generally produce several smaller flushes.  The biological effeciency of the small amount of brown rice flour in a cake isn't going to change much due to casing method, so overall yield will be about the same.  Of course, exceptions always occur.  If you want high yields, use the cakes to spawn pasteurized horse manure or compost, and then add a casing layer to that.  Good luck.<br />RR","title":"Re: Questions about RR utube vid."}}
