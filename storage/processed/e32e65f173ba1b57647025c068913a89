However, there is nothing wrong with pins forming in the jars before you case.  I've cased pinning jars hundreds of times and it speeds up pinning in the new substrate.  Paul Stamets mentions this in TMC, which was written many years ago.  This isn't new.  If the jar is sterile, and it is or you wouldn't have pins, then the pins are also sterile and will spawn into your casing just fine.  It's truly a myth that jars should be incubated in the dark.  Here's a link for you to pursue.  It's a series of pictures of pinning jars being used for grain to grain transfers, then on to casing.  As you can see, there is no reason to do anything to delay fruiting. <a href=\"http://www.mycotopia.net/cgi-bin/discus/show.cgi?tpc=2&amp;post=151092#POST151092\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mycotopia.net/cgi-bin/discus/show.cgi?tpc=2&amp;post=151092#POST151092</a>","title":"Re: tiny shrooms in jar"}}
