We keep our deep freezers in the barn, and they're already unplugged for the winter, getting rid of our biggest power pig.&nbsp; The fruiting room is all CFL and LED, so it only added $20 month to the electric bill, and that includes the inline blower bringing in fresh outside air 24/7.<br />I'm going to build a wood-fired boiler next year and then keep the current propane boiler for a backup.&nbsp; The boiler produces steam to sterilize the 100 pounds of sawdust we're doing everyday, plus it heats the air entering the fruiting area.&nbsp; I also ran steam lines the other way to heat my workshop.&nbsp; <br />It's -10 outside right now, and I just checked on the fruiting area and it's right at 64, which is perfect.&nbsp; I'd just like to be able to do it with wood, since I have access to a large forest fire area which killed the trees, but left them standing.&nbsp; That gives me pretty close to a zero carbon footprint, since the trees are already releasing their carbon into the air.&nbsp; <br />RR","title":"Re: If you think it's cold where you live. . ."}}
