There is no need for the ultrasonic.  My greenhouse is easily the size of three marthas and two coolmists on the floor provide 99% humidity by running one to two minutes on, then two to three minutes off. Short cycling the humidifiers cuts way down on the amount of dripping from the mist hitting shelves. I tweak the cycle timer depending on how full the unit is at any given time.  Trays of damp perlite on the floor catch any drips and return them to the air as humidity.<br />I also have a stand alone air conditioner connected to the greenhouse for use in cold shocking cold weather edibles.  I have it configured for the fan to be always on.  The air is piped to the lower part of the greenhouse so that the humidifier blows right up into the fresh air supply from the AC.  The return air is located in the ceiling of the greenhouse and it exhausts back to the unit, where the air is returned to the bottom of the greenhouse, providing constant circulation and turbulence.  Constant air movement is critical to avoid trichoderma and cobweb.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Dual grow closet design questions"}}
