They're for two totally different purposes.<br />Perlite, rinsed and drained well, will provide an excellent source of humidity in a terrarium, because it has a large surface area to evaporate moisture from.  Lay it in the bottom 2\" deep after rinsing and draining.  I use no standing water at all, and achieve 99% humidity.<br />Vermiculite absorbs water and serves to hold it for your flush.  Use it as the recipe calls for in pf cakes and also if you make up compost or even horse manure substrates, a small amount of vermiculite helps to hold water as well as to prevent clumping.  In bulk substrates, it's optional of course, but I've found it does help.<br />RR","title":"Re: vermiculite vs. perlite"}}
