You need a laminar flow hood.  I used to mist a ten percent bleach solution in the air, but got tired of burning my eyes everytime I had to do sterile work.  Now I spray the room with Oust until it's a fog.  Let the fog settle, then repeat.  After the second Oust treatment settles, turn on the laminar flow hood and allow it to run for an hour before beginning sterile work.<br />It's also important to remember we humans are the number one vector of contamination during sterile work, not the air.  Wear gloves, mask, etc.<br />RR","title":"Re: what is the best way to fight airborne comtamination?"}}
