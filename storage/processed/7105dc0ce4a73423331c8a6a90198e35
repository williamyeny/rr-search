That will explode them.  You put the pot you soak the grains in on the stove, and turn on the burner.  Let the grains heat up slowly with the water.<br />I soak anywhere from 4 to 24 hours.  It really doesn't make much difference.  The grains are only going to absorb so much, so you'll never over-hydrate by boiling.  After a few hours to overnight soak, I let the pot boil for five to ten minutes, then drain into the colander.  The steam that evaporates off the grains will dry the outside while the water runs down the drain.  If you'll toss the colander around with the grains a few times to make them steam off, they're ready to load in twenty minutes.<br />Gypsum serves two purposes. It adds calcium and suplhur, both essential mushroom nutrients, and helps prevent the grains from sticking and clumping up.<br />RR","title":"Re: First attempt failed, on to the next..."}}
