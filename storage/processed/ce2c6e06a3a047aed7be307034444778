That's a lot of little nasties to stick to your needle or the top of your jar where it will get pushed into the substrate when you inject.  A room also has normal circulation and all those nasties are moving around.  You can see this on a bright day when the sun is shining in through a window.  You'll see the larger of these dust particles, but there are hundreds of times that many smaller ones that you can't see.<br />A still air box stops the movement of these particles, greatly reducing the chances they'll get on your jar lid or needle.  You can also improve your chances by washing the glovebox and leaving the sides and bottom wet.  The moisture will attract the dust/contaminants and then they'll stick, leaving the air within, not only still, but with much less contaminants floating.<br />You don't want a filter and fan on a glovebox.  The only suitable filters for mycology are several inches thick and require a plenum behind them to build static pressure, which gives the laminar flow.  If you used a filter/fan in a glovebox, the turbulence would defeat the purpose.<br />Where a glovebox really shines is when doing agar work or grain to grain transfers.  They're not as good as a laminar flow hood by any means, but they're far better than open, turbulent air.<br />RR","title":"Re: clean box...why?"}}
