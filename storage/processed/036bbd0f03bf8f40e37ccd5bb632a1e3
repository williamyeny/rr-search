I don't even put a glass or bowl over the cap.  Just lay it on a piece of typing paper, and set a coffee filter over the top.  After you streak the agar dish, watch it daily, and when the spores germinate and grow half a cm or so, take a small piece of mycelium from the FARTHEST away from the point of germination, and transfer it to a new petri dish.  Discard the original.  This allows the mycelium to outrun the contams, and you can get clean cultures this way.  Of course, doing it this way, you'd just drop the agar wedges into your grain, as opposed to making syringes.  One petri dish can innoc 10 quarts of rye or corn.  Much faster/safer, imo.
