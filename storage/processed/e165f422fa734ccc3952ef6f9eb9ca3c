Quite simple and it works perfect. Use your pillow to sleep.. smile me.<br />Good grow </blockquote><br />I'll give you one thing, you're consistent.  You consistently give some of the most horrible advice I've ever read.  Grain jars require filtered gas exchange.  A jar with inoculation/gas exchange holes in the lid requires a filter above(or below), not foil.  The foil is there to prevent water that condenses on the lid of the pressure cooker from raining back down on the lids and getting into the jars.  It's removed when jars are removed from the PC.<br />RR","title":"Re: polyfill question"}}
