The bacteria that causes food poisoning dies when the fruit dries.  Nausea is normal when eating raw mushrooms.   The human body can't digest them.  You can prove this with an experiment:  Swallow a small fresh or dry mushroom whole without chewing, then watch your stool.  The mushroom will come out intact.<br />My theory is the non-digestable nature of raw mushrooms makes the body 'think' it has eaten something non-food so it wants to puke it out.  Next time, boil the mushrooms into tea, then strain the chunks out and only drink the liquid.  It will be much easier on your stomach.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can dried mushrooms make you sick??"}}
