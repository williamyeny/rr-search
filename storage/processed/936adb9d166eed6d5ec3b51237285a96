That means a 12 X 24 should require 200 to 300 cfm @ 1\" static pressure, and 24 X 24 should use a 400 to 600 cfm @ 1\" static pressure blower, assuming no losses.  You can add 10% to cover friction, etc. Be sure to either use a motor speed controller, or easier yet, just block part of the intake of the squirrel cage if you need to cut down the flow.<br />RR","title":"Re: 600 cfm blower?toned down?"}}
