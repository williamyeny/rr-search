You can also isolate healthy mycelium away from contaminants. With agar, you can easily clean up a contaminated syringe that would otherwise be useless if squirted directly into a jar of brf or grains.  Agar is not used to expand the mycelium, but rather to test and prove the mycelium.  When poured into a test tube slant, agar can be used to store cultures for many years if kept under refrigeration.<br />Liquid culture is a three-dimensional medium, therefore you can't isolate anything.  For best results, LC should be constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer for two reasons.  One is to oxygenate the medium to speed up growth, and the other is to prevent the individual pieces of mycelium from knitting back together.  By keeping thousands of individual hyphae separate, they draw into a syringe easily and give thousands of inoculation points when injected into grains.  Liquid culture should not be used until you have isolated pure mycelium on agar, then that pure mycelium can be put chopped up with a sterilized blender and placed into LC and agitated for a week, and then used to inoculate grains.  Used in this manner, it's much faster than doing a series of grain to grain transfers.   However, the current buzz of squirting spores into LC is counterproductive much of the time because you first have to grow out the LC, then inoculate your grains, then wait to see if it's contaminated or not.  It's a crap shoot when used like this, and when it fails, it sets you back many weeks.<br />RR","title":"Re: Why ager"}}
