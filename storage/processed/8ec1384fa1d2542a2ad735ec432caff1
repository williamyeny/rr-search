What are you trying to ask?  <br />This is the reason new growers get so confused.  Don't refer to your project as a <i>casing</i>.  The casing is only the top non-nutritious layer, such as peatmoss/vermiculite.  It's not a name for the project itself.<br />If you're trying to ask if your straw <b>substrate</b> should be cased, I've found straw performs just as well uncased.<br />RR","title":"Re: WormCastedWheatStraw (casing layer?)"}}
