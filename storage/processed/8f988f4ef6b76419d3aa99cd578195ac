The OP doesn't have a properly built shotgun terrarium because there isn't enough holes, and it's sitting on a table rather than up on blocks so air can enter from under the perlite where it's engineered to.<br />Secondly, humidity is only a secondary concern and easily made up for with extra misting.&nbsp; Fresh air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, and this point is missed by almost all new growers.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidity Issues"}}
