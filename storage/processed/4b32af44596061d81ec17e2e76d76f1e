Dunk and roll is my favorite method.  You're actually hydrating the individual mycelium cells, so it's a good idea to push the cakes a few inches under water so there's a bit of water pressure on them.  Remove after 24 to 36 hours and roll in dry verm, which is then heavily misted after being placed into the FC.<br />Another method is to pile up verm as deep as you can on top of the cake and keep that saturated.  Another is to set the cake in a saucer of water.  The straw method also works.  These last methods are fine during a flush.  Between flushes or prior to the first, I'd still suggest a dunk and roll.  Mushroom farmers have been soaking substrates in water to rehydrate them for at least a thousand years.  It's the time-proven method.<br />RR","title":"Re: Injecting water into BRF cakes - what's the latest?"}}
