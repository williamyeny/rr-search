Never use distilled water. It will lead to a higher rate of contamination, plus the minerals in tap, creek, lake, etc., water are beneficial to the mycelium. You have the proportions right at 2-1-1, but make sure the dry verm is the top layer, at least 1/2 to 3/4 (1cm) thick.&nbsp; 15 psi for 45 minutes is fine, or you can steam sterilize in a pot without pressure for 90 minutes.<br />2. Never use Lysol in a glovebox.&nbsp; Simply wash it out with soap and water and leave wet.&nbsp; The wet sides will trap and hold contaminant spores via molecular adhesion.&nbsp; Never wipe your needle with an alcohol soaked towel or anything else.&nbsp; You're supposed to flame sterilize the needle until red-hot before the first jar and between each jar.&nbsp; Use while still hot.&nbsp; The first drop of solution cools the needle.&nbsp; Alcohol doesn't kill everything and it kills <i>nothing on the inside</i> of the needle.<br />3. Never put jars in a sealed up tub, regardless of temperature.&nbsp; 75F is fine, but the black bag prevents light from reaching your jars, and normal ambient room light is beneficial from day one.&nbsp; Most people colonize jars on a book shelf in an open room out of direct sunlight, but not in total darkness either.&nbsp; It's common for it to take over 7 days from spores to see visible growth with the naked eye.&nbsp; I'm sure you've tossed out some perfectly fine jars.<br />It's obvious that you haven't found the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">brf tek videos</a> yet.&nbsp; Watch all four and follow them to the letter.&nbsp; Don't cut corners.<br />RR","title":"Re: need some sterile advice pls"}}
