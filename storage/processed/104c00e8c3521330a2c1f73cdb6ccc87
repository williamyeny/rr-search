Sounds like you have at least twice as much spawn as manure.  I'd say three to four days tops. Hopefully, that's a very small tray.  You should be using at least twice as much manure as spawn.  You have it backwards.<br />Why are you worried so much about light?  Light becomes a pinning trigger at full colonization, and has no effect prior to then.  I colonize jars and substrates right next to a large 4 tube fluorescent light fixture that runs 12 hours per day.<br />What was verm doing all over the top?  That makes no sense at all.<br />88 to 89F is at least ten degrees above the temp that will deliver maximum growth.  Sounds like you have some reading to do.<br />RR","title":"Re: Irc ?s and Spawn ?s"}}
