This is because an over-nutritious substrate leads to deformed fruits and other mutations.&nbsp; <br />Grains such as rice take a bit longer to be consumed therefore we recommend a longer consolidation period with cakes.&nbsp; With bulk substrates, give it a day or three after full colonization and then let it rip.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bulk consolidation?"}}
