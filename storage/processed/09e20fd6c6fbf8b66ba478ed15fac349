Early in development, they will turn towards a source of wind.&nbsp; Later, as they develop into actual mushrooms, they will orient their caps towards a light source to derive as much energy from it as possible.&nbsp; They don't use light to 'know which way to grow' but rather turn towards it to get as much as possible.<br />RR","title":"Re: Fruits seem to be laying down"}}
