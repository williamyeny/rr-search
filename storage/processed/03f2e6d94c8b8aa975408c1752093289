For a given resistance, more flow means you naturally develop more static pressure.&nbsp; <br />Imagine blowing through a straw using your mouth.&nbsp; If you blew real easy, there would be almost no (static) pressure against the inside of your cheeks, but also not much flow.&nbsp; If you blew harder, there would be more flow, but also more pressure against the inside of your cheeks(static pressure) The straw diameter would determine <i>resistance</i>, and the air coming out the straw would be the cfm(flow), and how hard you exhaled would create the static pressure.<br />RR","title":"Re: This blower a good match for this filter?"}}
