Not all strains are compatible and they don't merge into a single organism.&nbsp; Therefore you have more than one strain fruiting on the same substrate.&nbsp; Generally, clusters produce more product, so you might try <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Mushroom-Cloning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">cloning</a> from a cluster if they also have the other qualities you're seeking.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cutting at the base vs. twist n pull method"}}
