These tags, while an honor, are not intended to be an ego trip, but simply a help to our new members who often have to wade through conflicting advice on a new hobby that can seem overwhelming at first. If you're presented with two completely opposing answers to a question, and one of the members has a trusted cultivator tag, his or her advice would be your preferred answer.<br />The moderators are in regular contact behind the scenes, and we'll be the ones to give the tags, and to take them away for cause when necessary.&nbsp; I'm sure we've missed a few members who should have the tags, so as time goes on, we'll be adding more to the list.&nbsp; We really hope this helps.<br />RR","title":"[STICKY] The TRUSTED CULTIVATOR Tag"}}
