I just wish coir wasn't so darned expensive.  Three or four years ago when I first started recommending coir as a substrate instead of casing material, everybody thought I must have fallen off a turnip truck and bumped my head.  You can also mix it with straw to help fill in the gaps, but don't go overboard.<br />Don't use it if you're growing shiitake mushrooms though.  For some reason, they refuse to fruit if coir is in the substrate.<br />RR","title":"Re: coir as a bulk substrait"}}
