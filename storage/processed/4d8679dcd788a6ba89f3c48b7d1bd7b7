That is the first mistake.  In addition, plain vermiculite is a very poor choice for casing pf cakes.  They're already 2/3 vermiculite when you make them.  Now you have diluted the small amount of brown rice flour which is the only source of food, even further.<br />You don't need to provide any humidty at all during casing run.  In fact, get the trays out of the tub with perlite and set them on a bookshelf.  Be sure that each tray is covered with foil.  If you still don't see any mycelium breaking through the verm in a few days, take the foil off and introduce to fruiting conditions at that time.<br />Next time, I'd suggest a dunk and roll for brf cakes.  If you want more product, break up the cakes and spawn to manure or coir.  When that colonizes, add a casing layer of peat/verm mixed 50%/50%, and limed to pH 8.<br />RR","title":"Re: casings not colonizing"}}
