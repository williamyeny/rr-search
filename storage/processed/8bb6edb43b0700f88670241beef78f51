I prefer peat/verm, but verm/coir also works, but be sure to use considerably more verm than coir.  60/40 is ok, as is 70/30 verm-coir.  Don't forget the gypsum.  It increases yields considerably and is well worth the effort to find.  Lime to an initial Ph of 8.<br />RR","title":"Re: verm/coir casing on coir substrate?"}}
