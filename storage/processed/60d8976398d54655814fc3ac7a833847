Boiling also completes the inner hydration, which is where you want the moisture. If you load the jars with wet grains, they'll ruin.  Either boil, then when you drain into a collander, shake them around to steam off the surface moisture(preferred), or as an alternative, dry them by laying on a towel before loading.   I prefer the former.<br />RR","title":"Re: Just soaked WBS, about to PC, is it supposed to be soggy and mushy?"}}
