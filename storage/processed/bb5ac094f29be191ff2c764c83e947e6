I've even dipped wild cultures into ten percent bleach solution before cloning. Peroxide is another story though.<br />Bleach is effective against bacteria, but since bacteria isn't a contaminant of fruiting substrates, there is no reason to dunk in it.&nbsp; Molds contaminate fruiting substrates and bleach won't bother mold.&nbsp; Peroxide destroys microbes at the cellular level, which isn't good for bacteria or fungi.<br />After mixing bleach with water, you can add an equal amount of vinegar(same amount as bleach) to lower the pH, making it more effective as a surface disinfectant.&nbsp; I use that mixture whenever I bleach bomb my lab or grow room.<br />Of course, it should go without saying to keep bleach off your fruiting trays.&nbsp; It does nasty things to mushrooms.<br />RR","title":"Re: Bleach, H2O2, and Mycelium"}}
