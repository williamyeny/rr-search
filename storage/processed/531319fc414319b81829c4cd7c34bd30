One guy might think the Tex strain produces lots of small mushrooms because that's what he got.  However, the next guy who got spores from the same supplier might think the Tex strain grows a few huge fruits, because that's what he got.  That's the nature of multispore inoculation.  <br />Good luck to all and please keep it nice.<br />RR","title":"Re: Talapla"}}
