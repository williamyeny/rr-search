I've used sheep, goat, cow, Llama, Horse, deer, moose, and elk, all with great results.&nbsp; The point being that mushrooms don't 'suck up' bacteria from manure.&nbsp; Any transfer is by direct contact.&nbsp; <br />Normal food safety precautions should always be followed, especially when eating things raw.<br />RR","title":"Re: OOOO Deer poo!"}}
