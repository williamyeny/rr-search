As a test, I recently left some sterilized supplemented sawdust in these bags for three months in open air without inoculating, and they were fine, contaminant free. However, you really should invest in a flowhood if you want to move up to bulk growing like this.<br />There's no need for a silicone injection port on a spawn bag.&nbsp; Simply inject through the bag and then immediately cover the wound with tape.<br />RR","title":"Re: sealing bags before PCing?"}}
