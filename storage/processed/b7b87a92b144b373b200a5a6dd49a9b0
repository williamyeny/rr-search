Unfortunately, you have to pick out growers who are respected, and follow their advice. If you listen to some of the crap that gets posted around here by the noobs, it will seriously fuck up your grows, as you've seen first hand.  Get a fluorescent lamp and put it near your fruiting chamber and you'll do fine.  Run it 12/12 and NEVER run light 24/7.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pinning + light question"}}
