That's why the mushrooms grew from the edges. A fully colonized substrate wants to fruit.  Full colonization and air exchange are the numbers one and two pinning triggers.  The mushrooms are not going to fight their way up through a layer of vermiculite when there's an area of 100% humidity in the crack around the edges to fruit from. It has little to do with light penetrating the container.<br />Don't stack them.  That would be repeating the mistake and they won't fruit from the edges unless that's the best environment.  You can stack two cakes together as one, but you wouldn't stack a terrarium full or all the moisture would run from gravity to the bottom cakes, waterlogging them, and drying out the top ones.<br />RR","title":"Re: not sure if its a casing or a cake?"}}
