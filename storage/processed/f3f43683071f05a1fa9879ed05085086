If your local water is bad, use bottled or distilled.<br />Rinse the substrate under a faucet prior to beginning the dunk, then rinse again afterward.  It's also best to dunk in a sealed jar in the refrigerator to prevent bacteria growing while the block is underwater.<br />If there's a few small pins on the cake or other substrate, don't pick them unless they're aborts.
