The large kernel size means there is a lot of real estate to recover across whenever they are damaged by spawning. In addition, the month old jars of mycelium had considerably slowed down from the rapid growth they had during colonization. I no longer use popcorn at all unless I'm totally out of everything else and there happens to be a bag on the shelf. Rye will work much better.  The smaller kernels also mean there is many more points of inoculation, as well as much more mycelium in each jar.<br />Next time, try rye berries, don't use bleach, and wait for pins before birthing.  Use a full spectrum light or at least fluorescents.  Indirect sunlight also works great.<br />There is no certain frequency of light that makes mushrooms pin.  There is a sentence in one of paul's books where he mentions an experiment that somebody did that showed light at the high end of the spectrum works better.  I can concur because I had another project going in my mushroom room once that required a 400 watt metal halide fixture, and the pinsets on my mushroom crop went way up.  Jars would pin invitro almost as soon as full colonization, and these were strains that don't normally pin invitro.  Just remember, when he says blue light, it doesn't mean light that 'looks' blue.  Often you see the blue because that's what the glass cover filters out, making it the opposite of what you want.<br />It's a bummer that all that hard work went to waste.  Just remember, you can't blame a tek when you deviate so much away from it.  If you still have some straw left, do it again with fresh spawn and properly pasteurized straw, expose to full spectrum light from day one, and birth when you see two to three pins.<br />RR","title":"Re: My straw log won't fruit!
