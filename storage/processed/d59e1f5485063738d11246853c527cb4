All you need is still air.  A glovebox does not need to be sterile at all. Wash it with soap and water.  Some guys use a bit of bleach in the wash water.  If I've worked with contaminated cultures on the previous use, I also use bleach.  Otherwise, I just use soap and water and leave the floor a bit damp.  This will cause any contaminants that land there to stay there. Just cut your arm holes in the side and have a lid on, but you don't need to tape around the lid if you're using a clear rubbermaid type container.  Wear latex gloves.<br />You can pull your arm out to flame the needle or leave it in, your choice.  I flame on the outside because it keeps things cooler inside.<br />RR","title":"Re: A few glove box questions"}}
