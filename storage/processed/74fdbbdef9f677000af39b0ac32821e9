I can get 1/3 of a jar of sclerotia for each jar of grain.  With Mex a, it's about half a jar of sclerotia from a jar of grains.  I'd suggest forgetting about the bag for another month or two, and then break it up to get your stones out. You can always stick a few pieces of scerotia into a flower pot if you want some fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: P. Atlantis yield question ( RR advice would be appreciated)"}}
