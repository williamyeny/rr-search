I tweak the cycle timer depending on season and ambient humidity in the room.  If you run it longer than fifteen minutes, you'll have water everywhere.<br />I burned up at least 20 coolmists before I stopped modding them and placed them inside.  The same two coolmists have now been in the mini-greenhouse for over two years.  Using hoses creates static pressure that ruins the bushings, thus burning out the motor in a very short time.  Coolmists are designed to provide humidity, not move air.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cool Mist Inside Greenhouse."}}
