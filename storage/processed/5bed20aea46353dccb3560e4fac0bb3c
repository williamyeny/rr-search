In addition, one fungus will NOT spread through the network of ANOTHER fungus.  Don't spread disinformation on the board.  If what you said was true, all outdoor grown mushrooms would be toxic.<br />It was a good move to toss out the contaminated tray.

Your fruits are safe to eat.<br />RR","title":"Re: Casing developed about an inch of green mold overnight..."}}
