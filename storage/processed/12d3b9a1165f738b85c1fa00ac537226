You can see nearly 20 to 1 being used on my DVD in the laundry basket section, the results of which are below. <br />Manure and straw do better with a one to three, or even one to four ratio.  It makes little difference if you're using cakes or grains.  Mycelium is mycelium, and brf cakes can be broken up or shaved with a cheese grater into many inoculation points.<br />My preference is rye grain for bulk grows, but there's nothing wrong with using cakes as spawn.  They work equally well.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-52/902278423-Laundry_basket_oysters_001a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-52/902278423-thumb_Laundry_basket_oysters_001a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: Using pftek for bulk straw grow"}}
