In theory, this practice, over duration, combined with good cleaning and sterilization procedures should keep airborn contaminates at a very very very low level!&nbsp; And its WAAAAAAAAAY cheaper than buying all those cans of OUST!&nbsp; </blockquote><br />Or, you could mix up a ten percent bleach solution into a simple hand mister and spray it into the air before doing sterile work.&nbsp; I used to use Oust, but it was expensive, of dubious value, and certainly no more effective than bleach which is 1% of the cost.<br />RR","title":"Re: triethylene glycol + propylene glycol + water + fog machine + timer = automatic sterilizer"}}
