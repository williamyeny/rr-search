Re-dunk your cakes, drill holes in all six sides per the shotgun terrarium tek and put five inches of well drained perlite in there.&nbsp; You'll have a flush in a few days.&nbsp; Your cakes are dry.&nbsp; 90% humidity is not sufficient for cakes, which need 95% or better to perform properly.<br />You'll have to mist regardless of the 'tek' you use for fruiting.&nbsp; If you provide proper fresh air, your cakes will dry out, even at 99%.&nbsp; You'll just have to mist before you leave, and again when you get home.<br />RR","title":"Re: First Grow and some unexpected problems..."}}
