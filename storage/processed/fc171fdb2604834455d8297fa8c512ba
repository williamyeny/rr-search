You won't heat that water above 100C, and if you think you can clean a microwave with bleach, you have no idea how the magnetron tube works, and the fact that it's in a chamber that can't be easily cleaned.<br />Using a microwave as a glovebox is like using your unflushed toilet as a glovebox.<br />Lots of new growers around here have tried and even bragged up microwave 'sterilization', but the funny thing is, NONE of them are saying to use a microwave a year or two later.<br />A few growers have successfully used a 'wave to 'pasteurize' substrates in a sealed bag, but even that is iffy, since it's so hard to control temperature.<br />RR","title":"Re: Microwave?"}}
