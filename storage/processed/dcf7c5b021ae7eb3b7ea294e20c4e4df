Room temperature works fine for fruiting.  Even a temperature into the 60's F., will work ok.  Set the fan on a timer to come on for a minute, once per hour.  That will be plenty.   There is no need to filter air in a fruiting chamber.  Just keep air exchange and humidity.  If you're setting up a tub type chamber, just use perlite humidification.  Humidifiers are better suited to mini-greenhouse operation.<br />RR","title":"Re: Humidty/Temp Controlled FC"}}
