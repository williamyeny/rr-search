The holes on the bottom actually increase humidity, while letting the CO2 drain.  The reason the holes on bottom increase humidity is because air currents travel from cold to warm, due to the pressure difference caused by the molecules being farther apart in warm air.   The warm air in the terrarium causes air to percolate up through the perlite, wicking moisture as it passes through.<br />Here's a still capture from my upcoming video where I demonstrate how I build terrariums.  All six sides have holes as you see.  4 to 5 inches of damp perlite maintain 95% humidity and as you can see, there's a ton of air exchange.  Fanning is not necessary, but certainly doesn't hurt.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/07-009/287245516-thumb_Terrarium_2a.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: how vital is it do have holes on the lower part of your FC for air exchange?"}}
