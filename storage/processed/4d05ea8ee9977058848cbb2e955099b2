Garden lime is intended to be put on your garden in the fall, so it can have all winter to break down to be ready next spring.  It says it's safer than hydrated lime because of the fact it takes so long to break down.  If you put hydrated lime on your plants, you could easily damage them from the rapid swing in ph.<br />However, for a casing that has a life measured in weeks instead of months or seasons, you need the fast acting lime.
