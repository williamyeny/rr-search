I just read again your first post in this thread.  You used boiling water.  That kills off the beneficial bacteria in the coir that keeps it alive, thus protecting it from molds.  That amounts to sterilization, not pasteurization.  You want to hydrate the coir to field capacity, and then pasteurize at 140F to 160F for an hour, to an hour and a half, but not longer.  Try not to let it exceed 170F at any time.  You'll want to insert a meat thermometer into the center of the substrate as you pasteurize to make sure it stays within the correct range.  I pasteurize in quart jars, in a large pot of water.  You can see part of the pasteurization tek in a short clip that is on my website.  I use the same pasteurization tek for compost, manure, and casing material.  Look at the horse manure tek clip, and the casing layer preview clip.  They're just short takes, but it might be enough to get the point.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green every time what am I doing wrong? phenomenon?"}}
