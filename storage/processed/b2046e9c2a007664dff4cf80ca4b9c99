This leaves the options menu open, obscuring the video, and unable to be closed. Entering fullscreen by the right-click context menu works fine.<br />Otherwise, looks nice. Thanks RR.</blockquote><br />See if that's fixed now.&nbsp; I found a few errors with the full screen mode coding.<br />RR","title":"Re: Embedded video player test"}}
