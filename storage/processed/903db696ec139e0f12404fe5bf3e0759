Every mushroom in the wild grows in conjunction with molds and bacteria.  I don't think I've ever picked an oyster off a log in the forest that didn't also have green mold growing on the same log.  It's everywhere.  Harvest the fruits and toss out the cake.  Never leave a contaminated cake in your growing area or house.  Bury it outdoors in a manure bed.<br />There's also a chance the fruit was damaged and it was just bruised.  Some strains bruise more green than blue.<br />RR","title":"Re: Green mold on shroom, RR help me!!!!"}}
