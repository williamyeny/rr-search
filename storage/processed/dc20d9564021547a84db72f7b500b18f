Don't use 'blue' lights or a 'blue' tub.  Such is not in any way, shape, or form what the mycelium needs to perform well.  The use of 'blue' led's or blue tubs is based on a misunderstanding of what Stamets was talking about in GGMM when he recommended high frequency lights, such as natural daylight fluorescent.<br />This has all been covered ad-nauseam in previous light threads.  It absolutely amazes me that people still repeat the 'any light will do' or 'if you can see, your mushrooms have enough light', or 'only a few minutes is enough' etc., etc.  If one is satisfied with shitty pinsets, the above is true.  If you're less than satisfied with shitty pinsets, use a light in the 6,500 Kelvin range.  Incandescent grow lights are one of the worst possible choices.<br />RR","title":"Re: UV light?"}}
