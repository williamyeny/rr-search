My experiments over many years have shown potency not to be related to the substrate, provided you've given the mycelium what it needs to grow and produce fruits.  A proper substrate, whether it's manure, coir, straw, cased grains, or even pf cakes will all produce potent mushrooms, provided you have a good fruiting strain.  Potency is genetics related, not substrate, and trust me, I've used a lot of substrates and additives to try to find a correlation.  There simply isn't one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Blood Meal And Coco Coir/"}}
