For your information, I do place the jars for recycle, but I won't open them in the house.  If you think pouring soap and bleach down the drain is less harmful to the environment than a jar going to the recycle bin, you're mistaken.  In addition, it takes oil-based energy from terrorist sponsoring nations in the middle east to sterilize the jars twice, so your point is well taken but misinformed.  Don't lecture people here.<br />RR","title":"Re: First grow, Green Mold... Owned :("}}
