No way I'd want to confront either of them after eating mushrooms. My neighbor's rotweiller has a huge gash down his side from one of them. He's lucky to have survived. <br />We're going shaggy mane and bolete picking today, so you can bet we'll be carrying our pepper spray.<br />Nice job on the monotubs too!&nbsp; Enjoy.<br />RR","title":"Re: 374.83 wet/ half of first flush."}}
