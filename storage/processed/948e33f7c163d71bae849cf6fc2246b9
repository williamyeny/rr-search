I tagged someone just last week. They're not awarded for parroting advice, but if someone posts pictures and describes how they did it, and shows by repeated grows that he/she's to be trusted with sound advice, they'll get the tag.<br />I put the tag on HC because she has awesome grows, while doing just about everything differently than I do.<br />This is off topic.&nbsp; If it doesn't die a natural death, I'll have to lock it later.<br />RR","title":"Re: HippieChick"}}
