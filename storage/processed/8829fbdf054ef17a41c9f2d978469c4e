Heated in oven for 2 hours at 170. This should effectively pasteruate right? And a bread tie to close the oven bag should be okay?</blockquote><br />No.&nbsp; <br />Two hours in the oven at 170 won't get your substrate anywhere near proper pasteurization temp.&nbsp; Don't attempt to use the oven to pasteurize.&nbsp; Air is a horrible heat conductor.&nbsp; Use steam or boiling water and start your 90 minute time when the center of your substrate reaches 140F, and don't let it exceed 160F during this time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Knee deep in cow shit.
