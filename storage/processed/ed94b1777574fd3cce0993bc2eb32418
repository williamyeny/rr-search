Sorry.  Surgeons don't operate with bare arms or anything else.  Everything is covered.  You can never clean your arms as clean as a freshly washed shirt.  As soon as you get done with the antibacterial soap, more skin cells will flake off and if they get in your grain jar or petri dish, you <i>will</i> get bacterial contamination.<br />Remember, we can't PC or flame sterilize our arms, and we'd never just wash a scalpel or needle.<br />RR","title":"Re: glove box arm holes"}}
