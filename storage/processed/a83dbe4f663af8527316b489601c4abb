So long as the air pressure is the same inside and outside the bag (which it will be in the pressure cooker), the bag will not expand.</blockquote><br />This is a mistake.<br />The pressure inside the bag and outside will not be the same except during the half hour or so that the PC and the bags are at full temperature.&nbsp; During the ramp up to 15 psi, pressure in the cooker rises faster than pressure inside the bag, and then during cool-down, pressure leaves the pressure cooker faster than the bag can cool and release its pressure.&nbsp; The result is inflated and/or burst bags.&nbsp; As said above, tyvek sleeves in each bag as shown in the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Sawdust-Woodchips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">video</a> ameliorates the problem.<br />RR","title":"Re: Alternative methods for sealing spawn bags"}}
