The problem stems from reading too many posts from those members who misuse the terminology.<br />A terrarium/fruiting chamber should not be sealed up.  Drill  a few holes at least into it and fan several times per day.  Air exchange is the number one pinning trigger once full colonization of the substrate is reached.  <br />You want lots of fresh air, and near saturation humidity.  Fan and mist as required to achieve the above.<br />RR","title":"Re: quick newb question about fanning"}}
