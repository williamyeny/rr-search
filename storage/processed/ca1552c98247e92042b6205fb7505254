(you want 15 psi of steam, not compressed air)<br />It's totally irrelevant how long it takes to reach 15 psi.&nbsp; The pressure won't start climbing until the contents of the bags are at the same temperature as the steam.&nbsp; When pressure is reached, set timer for 90 minutes for grains.&nbsp; Never pop the toggle or lift the weight off to release pressure when time is reached.&nbsp; Allow it to slowly drop as the sterilizer cools.<br />As shown in Let's Grow Mushrooms, place spacers between bags to allow the steam to totally surround each individual bag.&nbsp; I like to use tyvek sleeves to provide for filtering, while also making it easier to open the 'sealed' bags after the pc cycle.<br />Obviously, if you're using less than 15 psi/121C, increase sterilization time.<br />RR","title":"Re: Filtration when PC'ing bags"}}
