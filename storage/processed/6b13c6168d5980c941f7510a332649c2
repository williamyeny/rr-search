They actually INcrease side pinning as well by reflecting light down the sides.  Use black trays if you want, but side pinning is usually caused because that's where conditions are best.  The mycelium will pick the spot it's most comfortable pinning from, and form hyphal knots in that area.   It could mean your humidity is too low, or the casing layer too dry, thus the area around the edges was the preferred place for pinning.<br />RR","title":"Re: Myc eating my foil!?"}}
