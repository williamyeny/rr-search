At least I advised against it within the last week or so.  I recommend to mix the manure into the soil, but not to build a box that will attract insects to the different food source than the native one, and in addition, will flood when it rains.<br />I'd remake it without the plywood box.  Drying out a bit is good.  It will encourage the mycelium to branch out more in search of food and water.<br />RR","title":"Re: Outdoor beds drying??"}}
