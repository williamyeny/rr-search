It mixes with the air.&nbsp; In most fruiting chambers the CO2 is higher near the top because that's where the air exhausts.<br />You won't get enough from your monotubs to do your plants much good unless you have a shit ton of monotubs.&nbsp; I'd suggest making up a bunch of substrate bags.&nbsp; I'm using nearly 100 in my grow room, and I can keep the CO2 level above 700 ppm most of the time.&nbsp; You'll want the substrate bags in a closet or other separate enclosure so you can shut off the CO2 to your plants during their dark cycle.<br />RR","title":"Re: extracting co2 from mono tubs for plant use"}}
