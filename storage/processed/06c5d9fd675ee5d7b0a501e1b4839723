In fact, they stir around the air so much they cause more problems than they solve.  I have three or four of them sitting in my storage shed, never to be used again.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879888-glove_box_007.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879888-thumb_glove_box_007.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-31/454879880-glove_box_006.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-31/454879880-thumb_glove_box_006.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: does anyone here work completely open-air??"}}
