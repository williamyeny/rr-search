Often, fruits on the same flush will be vastly different in potency, because more than one 'strain' may be active on the same substrate.&nbsp; That's also why you might get a dud batch with horse manure, and the next inoculations on coir or brf cakes might be great, leading a new grower to mistakenly think it was the different substrate that resulted in the more potent fruits.<br />RR","title":"Re: What factors determine potency?"}}
