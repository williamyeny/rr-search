The disposable ones are cheap but you have to replace them after each use so its actually the most expensive.</blockquote><br />Wrong.&nbsp; Very wrong.<br />Disposable petri dishes cost less than what it costs in fuel and soap to wash the glass ones.&nbsp; They're by far the cheapest, and when you're isolating strains, you need up to 100 dishes, so that's a LOT of money spent for nothing if one is using glass.&nbsp; Leave the glass dishes to bio labs working with bacteria, and use disposable dishes for fungi.&nbsp; It's the cheapest and most environment-friendly way of working.&nbsp; I wouldn't use glass petri dishes or tiny jars even if they were given to me free.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cheap alternative to glass petri dishes at wally world *pics*"}}
