The standard they're testing is how the mask protects the wearer, which we don't have a concern for.  Our projects are not going to give us a fatal disease.  Respirators are tight fitting around the cheeks, to prevent you from inhaling air from the edges that doesn't get filtered.  This is important if you need protection from airborne pathogens.   <br />Surgical masks are open at the cheeks purposely to allow a low pressure route of escape for your exhaled bacteria(breath).  What passes through the mask generally has 99% of the bacteria filtered out, depending on brand. Hospital operating rooms have HEPA filters in the ceiling that draw the room currents up and away from the patient.  By having the doctor's breath leave in the direction of the ceiling, thus the filters, the patient is protected.  This is our scenario as well.<br />When the FDA says they don't test surgical masks, it means THEY don't test surgical masks.  It doesn't mean they don't get tested.  <br />A surgical mask with the N95 rating is going to do our job just fine.  However, a cheapie surgical mask works very well too.  It's all I've used for years.  The thing NOT to use is a construction type dust mask.<br />RR","title":"Re: micro pore tape stuck to latex gloves"}}
