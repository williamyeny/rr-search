That way they don't waste all their energy trying to do many things at once. Don't stress them out!</blockquote><br />It's the opposite.<br />Apply casing layer immediately which allows the grains or brf to recover right into the casing.&nbsp; This way you don't stress the mycelium out by having to recover twice.<br />RR","title":"Re: Case immediately after crumbling or let mycelia \"recover\" first?"}}
