My condo has wall to wall carpet, plus mold all over the bathroom.  The bathroom ceiling has mold from an old roof leak.  The bathtub has black mold on the caulking.  The walls around windows in the living room have black mold from condensation.  The carpet near the sliding glass door has mold caused by condensation.<br />It's amazing what attention to sterile procedures, synthetic filter disks, filter patch spawn bags and a flowhood or glovebox will do.<br />RR","title":"Re: Cobweb meets peroxide, At first you see it, now you don't"}}
