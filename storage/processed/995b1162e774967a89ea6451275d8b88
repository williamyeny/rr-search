The only difference is that I used pint jars, so I just trippled the amount of products to put into the substrate (same ratio and all that). Inoculated the jars, stuffed em in a box and now theyre waiting.<br />Two issues: 1, some of the jars got compacted by the pressure cooker, although this did not happen on the vids. I've searched and know its most likely my grade of verm. . .</blockquote><br />You didn't see the BRF compact on the video because the correct size 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars were used.&nbsp; I've posted hundreds of times that pint jars are not suitable.&nbsp; Since you tripled the amount of product going into the pint jars and they're only double in size, that explains the tight packing.&nbsp; I'd dump them out and start over with the correct size jars and the correct amount of substrate in each.<br />Fine verm is what is shown in the video and what is supposed to be used.<br />RR","title":"Re: Trouble with PF tek (?) 2nd batch"}}
