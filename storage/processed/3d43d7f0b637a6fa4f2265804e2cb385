Mine and many other grower's experiments have shown that more growth occurs during the dark cycle.&nbsp; My original time-lapse photos were so screwed by the dark period that the mushrooms appeared to jump in the first picture after lights on.&nbsp; Later, I put my light on a cycle timer so it would come on for 20 seconds for each picture.&nbsp; That cured the jerky pictures but slowed down total growth.<br />Mushrooms do not grow well with low level or no light.&nbsp; The do 'grow' but are light in weight, skinny with long stems and very tiny caps.&nbsp; Potency in psilocybin mushrooms is notably lower when insufficient light is used.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>shroomdust said:</strong><br />They will grow decent with no light except for what they get when fanning and misting. I don't think light is as big of a deal as people make it out to be. They derive energy from the nutrients in the substrate. They are not plants and do not use photosynthesis.</blockquote><br />Yuo will never get a proper flush from a substrate without a proper light cycle. Mushrooms do utilize light in the fruiting process, just not in the same way as plants.</blockquote><br />Correct.&nbsp; Mushrooms are not plants.&nbsp; They use light in a different way, just as us humans do.&nbsp; Mushrooms do indeed derive energy from light-They double or more in size and weight when exposed to the proper amount over being grown in darkness.<br />RR","title":"Re: Anyone ever tried different lighting schedule?"}}
