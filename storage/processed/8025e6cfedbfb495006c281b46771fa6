That is a mistake.  With spores, you want the spores to germinate in close proximity to each other so they can 'mate' and become faster growing dikaryons.  If you shake right after inoculation, you you spread the spores out away from each other, forcing slower growing monokaryons to colonize the jar, then mate later, setting the process back.   <br />With agar wedges or LC, allow the concentrated mycelium to 'jump off' onto several dozen grains for a few days first, then shake.  The jar will be colonized within three days after that.<br />The reason we wait for a few days after full colonization to spawn is not to make sure the middle is colonized.  It is because after full colonization, there is a period of 'consolidation' that is important as the mycelium consolidates its hold on the substrate, greatly increasing mycelial mass.<br />RR","title":"Re: Does this look to dry?"}}
