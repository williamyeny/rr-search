In fact, mushroom mycelium also prefers an acid pH, so in a perfect world without molds, we wouldn't use lime at all.  However, the world isn't perfect, and since our mushroom mycelium can <i>tolerate</i> a high pH, while the chief bad guys can't, we use it.  <br />I've also found an initial pH of 7.5 to 8 seems to keep trichoderma at bay until you get a few flushes, but doesn't hinder the mushroom mycelium too much.  Gypsum also tends to help keep the pH where we set it, preventing wild swings in either direction.<br />RR","title":"Re: pH buffer for peat based casing mixes."}}
