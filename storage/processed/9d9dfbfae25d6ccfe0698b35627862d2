If you squeeze it a bit harder, a small 'rivulet' will drop down and then stop after a few seconds.</blockquote><br />Not correct.<br />Field capacity is a measurement of bulk substrates such as manure or coir, and doesn't apply to BRF because it would make it too wet.&nbsp; A properly made batch of brf that is ready to be loaded into jars will have no water at all squeeze out if you pick up a handful and squeeze hard.&nbsp; It will however, be damp.<br />For the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">BRF tek</a>, you're supposed to use fine or medium grade verm because it holds more water, thus your cakes aren't as 'wet' with a given amount.&nbsp; The recipe when using fine or medium verm is 2,1,1 and since you used less water than that, you 'may' be OK, but it's all a wild guess.<br />After mixing the water and verm, there should be no standing water in the bottom of the bowl.&nbsp; If there is, pour it out, and then mix in the brown rice flour.&nbsp; A cake made slightly dry will colonize FAR faster, thus less contamination prone.&nbsp; After full colonization plus one week, you dunk and roll to insert the moisture required for the flush.<br />RR","title":"Re: degree of wetness in substrate"}}
