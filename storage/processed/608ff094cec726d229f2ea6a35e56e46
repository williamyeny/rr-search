The small size of the grain, means there is much more surface area available for the mycelium to colonize, therefore much more mycelium will grow in a given size jar.  It's a pain in the butt to work with, but this is the tek I've developed over the years.<br />1.  Don't presoak or precook.<br />2.  Mix as you did, twice as much grass seed as liquid in your jars. For use in quart jars, use 3/4 cup grass seed, and 1 1/2 cups liquid. Use coffee at 1/2 the strength you would drink it, to mix with the grass seed.  Coffee/caffeine greatly inhances sclerotia production.<br />3.  Add a pinch of gypsum to each jar.  (very important)<br />4.  Put a solid lid on the jar, and shake the devil out of it.<br />5.  Allow to sit for an hour, and shake very well again.<br />6.  Remove the solid lid, and replace with a lid with two 1/8\"(1mm) holes, and a synthetic filter disk.  Note: Don't use plastic lids. Use the metal lids and rings that come with mason jars, and place the filter on the outside of the jar.  If the filter is exposed to the rye grass seed, it will become wet, and bacteria will colonize right through the filter.  The filter MUST remain dry.<br />7.  PC at 15 lbs for 90 minutes.<br />8.  Allow the PC to cool naturally for one hour after pressure returns to zero.  Don't do anything to speed up the pressure release, such as lifting the weight.<br />9.  After one hour, the jars will still be very hot.  Remove from pc with gloves, and shake very well.  They will shake easily if you bang them against a bicycle tire.  I air up my bike tires until they're very hard, then use that to beat the jars against.  <br />10.  Allow the jars to cool, inoculate and shake again.<br />Now.  All that being said, my experience is that rye berries are a better sclerotia producing grain than rye grass seed.  Also, expose the colonizing jars of sclerotia to light on a shelf in a normal room.  The below pictures are a comparison of rye grass seed to rye berries.  Both sets of jars were inoculated with the same isolated strain at the same time.  The rye grain jars are clearly ahead of the grass seed jars.<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/04-24/708328524-mex_a_005b.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/04-24/708328524-thumb_mex_a_005b.jpg\"></a>","title":"Re: RGS Prep"}}
