The purpose of the foil is to prevent water that drips down from the lid of the pc from being able to pool up and enter your jars through the filter.  Remove the foil after jars come out of the pc.<br />I use the metal lids upside down so the metal contacts the jar instead of the rubber.  This makes the lid much easier to remove later, as it won't be stuck in place by the rubber.  Tighten the ring tight.<br />Coffee filters are of no mycological use that I know of.  Contaminants will smoke through them like a minnow through a bass net.<br />RR","title":"Re: Lid tightness question, probably been asked before but i can't find it."}}
