Petroleum based solvents such as WD-40 can cause problems, but not the fat stem/tiny caps.<br />Condensation is not an indication of humidity level.&nbsp; Condensation indicates a temperature differential across the surface. Fat stems and tiny caps seem to be genetic in nature, but are sometimes caused by insufficient light and/or birthing too soon.&nbsp; It's best to wait a week after full colonization before birthing the cakes or other substrates.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pins with an Obesity problem (noob needs help plz :) )"}}
