In addition, right against the perlite is the most humid microclimate, thus it encourages pinning.  It's also the area that any perite will stick to the cake simply by geography.<br />I've added a bit of perlite to casing soil mixes with good results.  The perlite keeps the casing nice and fluffy and provides many air pockets which are conducive to fruiting.  I suppose the same could help on a cake.  <br />Perhaps one of you could do a dunk and roll in the normal way with verm, and then follow it up with a perlite roll as an experiment.  <br />RR","title":"Re: A somewhat taboo question"}}
