I've found mexicana to be much more like acid than mushrooms.  It's a cleaner trip, without the body numbing that makes it hard to move or communicate with cubensis.  I've also found sclerotia to be a much more spiritual trip than cubes.  In addition, it's shorter lasting, so it's not out of the question to do on a weeknight, when you have to be at work the next day.   They're my favorite, along with ps cyans.<br />I use rye berries, but they're simple as pie to clean up.  Simply take a stone in your hands and rub the grains off with your fingers.  The texture is similar to nuts, and the mushroom taste is mild and not unpleasant at all.<br />RR","title":"Re: WBS and sclerotia?"}}
