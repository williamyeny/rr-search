They don't care one whit whether the substrate is cased or uncased.  You should maintian humidity in the upper 90% range for best results when growing mushrooms.  The oft repeated advice that 'casings only require 80% humidity' is wrong.<br />A dunk and rolled cake is simply dunked and rolled, not cased.  The verm serves as a <i>mini-casing</i> to an extent because the verm acts as a moisture reservior to store water from misting, releasing it slowly to the mycelium.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is a rolled cake considered \"cased\"?"}}
