When you isolate on agar, you can get 20 or more good, rhizomorphic isolates from a single swipe of spores or two drops of solution from a syringe.<br />I grow out all isolates that look good, then pick the best ones and keep them.  By labeling the petri dishes and keeping them in the refrigerator, I can go back to the original culture for years into the future once I see which fruits best or has other qualities I desire.  If you clone, you already have one full generation towards senescence.  By transferring the best strains from petri dishes to test tubes, they can be stashed away in the refrigerator for long term storage.   It's possible to have 20 or more year old cultures with no more than a few weeks of cell division time on them.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is this normal mycelium?"}}
