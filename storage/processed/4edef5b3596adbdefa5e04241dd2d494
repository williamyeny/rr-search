Also, a big tip that I got from one of my bio classes is to keep it dry for long periods. I did this when I started getting bacterial contams. All I did was wipe the tub down and then I wiped it dry. Then I left it to air dry for about 36 hours before use. The way it works is that it'll kill off any remaining contams because you cut off their water supply. This doesn't work with spores though they can survive dry conditions.</blockquote><br />Bacterial endospores can also survive dry conditions.</blockquote><br />Bacterial endospores are not a contaminant of the fruiting chamber process.&nbsp; All the original poster needs to do is wash the tub with soap and water and then reuse, as already stated above.<br />RR","title":"Re: Re-using monotub that housed green mold infested substrate"}}
