This has been proved by growers for many years. Personally, I don't like any standing water because it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and other creatures such as gnats, while lowering humidity because any perlite that is underwater is useless.  Other successful growers disagree of course, but the above is based on my personal experience.<br />Damp perlite will remain damp and will continue to provide humidity for several weeks in a terrarium.  Rinse, drain and re-apply between flushes when you clean out your terrarium anyway.<br />RR","title":"Re: perlite not workin for me"}}
