It stimulates pinning on the bottom where you don't want pins forming.  It can also waterlog down there.  The casing layer goes on top.<br />Hippie chick sometimes sets UNcased substrates on a bed of vermiculite as a moisture reservoir, not bottom casing, but I wouldn't recommend that to new growers until you've done a few crops.  It takes time to learn to recognize optimum moisture content, and if you get it too wet, you're screwed.  A waterlogged substrate will fruit poorly if at all.<br />RR","title":"Re: bottom layer of casing?"}}
