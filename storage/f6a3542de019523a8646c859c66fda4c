Sometimes, cubes pin in spite of what we do, rather than because of it.  Follow proper procedures and you'll have success.  Cubes are NOT a cold weather species that benefit from temp cycling.  They fruit in the wild in spring-summer-fall, therefore temp cycling is irrelevant.  Provide the proper humidity and air exchange and they'll fruit, even if you colonize at temps in the 60's and fruit at temps in the 90's.  That's a fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7145665</prev>\n<first>1945207</first>\n<last>7145679</last>\n<when>1183908589</when>\n<utime>07/08/07 06:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
