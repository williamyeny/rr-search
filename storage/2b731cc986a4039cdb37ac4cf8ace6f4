I'm sure there are other suppliers, so if they've gone out of business, I'll remove the link.  Just do an internet search for 'kite making tyvek'. I still prefer synthetic filter disks as they can be used over and over again for years.  I have some that have been used hundreds of times, if not thousands.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5894291</next>\n<prev>5894221</prev>\n<first>5893670</first>\n<last>5895055</last>\n<when>1153767484</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 09:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
