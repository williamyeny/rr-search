There certainly is no reason to worry about keeping inoculated jars in darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After your substrate is fully colonized and the casing layer is applied, it's best to keep it in the dark so that when you introduce air exchange, you also give light at the same time, so that the major pinning triggers can all come at once.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5978416</next>\n<prev>5978150</prev>\n<first>5978112</first>\n<last>5979046</last>\n<when>1156008093</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
