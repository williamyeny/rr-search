It looks like a good filter if you can find a powerful enough blower, but I still think they screwed up transposing the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with ebay is that stuff is either broken, damaged, stolen, or a combination of all three.  I'd pass on that one.  Stamets sells the right ones on fungi.com, but you can probably find them cheaper from a distributor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8462874</prev>\n<first>8462839</first>\n<last>8462884</last>\n<when>1212155771</when>\n<utime>05/30/08 04:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
