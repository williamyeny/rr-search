I've found it before at the base of mushrooms where they turn brown and rot.  Did you perhaps dunk the cakes too long or otherwise squirt water on them to the point of saturation?  Another cause of this is setting the cakes directly on the perlite, where they wick up excess moisture.  If you suspect bacteria, be sure to boil any mushrooms into tea before consuming.  The boiling will kill any live bacteria that might give you a case of food poisoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green mold.  If you've tried to save projects in the past by cutting it out, bleaching, salting, etc., it has allowed millions or even billions of trich spores to build up in your grow area.  You'll have to dump everything out, including the perlite and wash with bleach.  The perlite is non-nutritious so doesn't contaminate, but it can harbor contaminant spores.  The main line of defense against green molds is proper air exchange.  Trichoderma will not grow in fresh, circulating air.  It requires stale, still air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ground limestone is ok, but I personally prefer hydrated lime, which will go to work almost immediately.  With hydrated lime, it's extremely important to mix it with the dry ingredients prior to adding the moisture.  You also want to pick up some gypsum, which is as important as the lime for a good casing layer texture and mineral content.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5371315</prev>\n<first>5371315</first>\n<last>5371366</last>\n<when>1141685770</when>\n<utime>03/07/06 12:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
