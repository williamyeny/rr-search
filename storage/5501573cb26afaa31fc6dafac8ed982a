Don't wait for it to colonize, because it rarely will. Don't re-case. Trays can be soaked for a few hours under running water.  Just let the faucet fill up the tray and gently run over the sides and down the drain.  Use jars of water or rocks to hold the substrate from floating.  After four or five hours, most substrates will be re-hydrated.<br />I like to wait up to a week after picking a flush before doing the above.  During this rest time, allow the substrate to dry out a bit, and then soak as above and return to fruiting conditions.<br />RR"}}
