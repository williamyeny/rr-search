That was bad information in a book from 30 years ago.&amp;nbsp; The fact is, cubes will pin in total darkness, just not well.&amp;nbsp; 12/12 with bright light at 6500K will give best results.&amp;nbsp; A few minutes of direct sunlight per day also works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13087411</next>\n<prev>13087356</prev>\n<first>13085841</first>\n<last>13149636</last>\n<when>1282520442</when>\n<utime>08/23/10 02:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
