But this same shit happened last time I cased. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, no wonder.&amp;nbsp; That's ten degrees hotter than you should ever attempt to colonize a casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why do they say 10 parts peat and 10 parts verm.? why the hell don't the just say 1 to 1? lmao just off the wall while I was thinkin it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who says that?&amp;nbsp; I've always said 50/50.&amp;nbsp; Mix equal amounts of peat and verm.&amp;nbsp; However, you want to add gypsum at up to ten percent by volume the amount of peat, and hydrated lime at a rate of one teaspoon per cup of peat. Mix the dry ingredients, less the verm, and hydrate.&amp;nbsp; Then mix in the hydrated verm and as a final step, adjust to field capacity and pasteurize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, cover your grains with the casing layer, put foil over the top, and let it colonize for a few days at normal room temperature. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9165281</next>\n<prev>9164904</prev>\n<first>9163742</first>\n<last>9166845</last>\n<when>1225488867</when>\n<utime>11/01/08 12:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
