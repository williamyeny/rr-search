The important thing is to turn down heat when pressure is reached so you don't boil it dry.  I'd also put a layer or two of jar lid rings or something on the bottom under the supplied spacer, so you can get the jars totally out of the water.  When the water boils, there's always the chance that it will boil up and over the top of the jars, getting water under the foil and into the jar itself, ruining the moisture content.  A good way to know if you reduced heat enough is that no more than 1/2\" of water should have boiled off during the cycle.<br />When you can afford it, get an All American.  They're the best, have gages, and last a lifetime.<br />RR"}}
