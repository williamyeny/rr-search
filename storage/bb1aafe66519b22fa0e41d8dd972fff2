{"key":"post-5118195","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5118195</id>\n<content>150 cubic feet of coir mixed with verm is enough to put a 1&quot; casing layer over 3600 12&quot; X 12&quot; trays.  That is more than most major commercial mushroom farms are capable of making at once. If you've never used coir, I'd suggest starting out a tad smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I'm no fan of using coir for a casing.  It has so many nutes that the mycelium tends to fully colonize it, leading to overlay.  I've often said that a coir casing layer is actually a second substrate layer, and in fact I've spawned to plain coir and used it as a bulk substrate.  It's at least as good as cow manure when used that way.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd recommend peat/verm.  Add calcium carbonate or hydrated lime at the rate of 5% of the peat by volume, disregarding the verm in that calculation. Add gypsum at the rate of 5% by volume to the whole mix and do include the verm in that calculation.  Moisten to field capacity and pasteurize for an hour or two at 150F. Do not sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5118217</next>\n<prev>5118187</prev>\n<first>5118127</first>\n<last>5119569</last>\n<when>1135869498</when>\n<utime>12/29/05 05:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
