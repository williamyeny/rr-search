Personally however, I see no reason for the polyfill either.  I leave my fruiting environment wide open so the air can flow in and out at will.  Natural circulation will provide your air exchange, and I've never found a need to filter or otherwise clean the air entering a fruiting chamber.  Trichoderma won't grow in an environment with fresh, circulating air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5345551</next>\n<prev>5345419</prev>\n<first>5345041</first>\n<last>5348854</last>\n<when>1141074187</when>\n<utime>02/27/06 11:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
