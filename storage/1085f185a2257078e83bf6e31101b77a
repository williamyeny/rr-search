We also harvest several hundred pounds per year of wild reishi.  For those who are not aware, reishi brings $1,000 per kilo on the legal market.  That takes a lot of drying space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cubensis are a great way to learn the mushroom life cycle, but it only takes a few months to grow a lifetime supply.  That's why most growers move on to other species, or lose interest in the hobby.  I suggest to all to stop in at the gourmet and medicinal forum to exchange tips and ideas on legal edibles.  Mushroom growing is great fun, and if you play your cards right, there's a lot of money to be made.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7110802</next>\n<prev>7110641</prev>\n<first>7110605</first>\n<last>7110812</last>\n<when>1183220120</when>\n<utime>06/30/07 07:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
