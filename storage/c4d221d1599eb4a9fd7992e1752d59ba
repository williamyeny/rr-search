It involves three different times boiling the grains 24 hours apart.  It has been known to succeed, but the failure rate is higher than most of us are willing to accept.  It all depends on how valuable your time is to you.  I've seen PC's at the goodwill for ten bucks on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pf tek is dependable and makes a decent spawn for bulk, so my suggestion would be to use that until you can swing a PC.
