Attach a piece of PVC to the bottom of the 'door' to hold it down.  To open, simply roll up the PVC, then install a hook at the top to hold it open while you work.  It's how I did mine.  It's completely loose on the edges of the door all the way from top to bottom.  The loose fit provides plenty of continuous fresh air exchange, and the humidifier inside provides the humidity.<br />RR"}}
