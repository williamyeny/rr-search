{"key":"post-5738730","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5738730</id>\n<content>Unfortunately, the OMC seems to have developed a nomenclature of its own, with any tray for growing mushrooms being incorrectly called a casing.  A substrate in a tub is simply a substrate, just as it would be if it were not in a tub or tray, such as a straw log.  If you put a casing layer on it, it becomes a cased substrate.  The 'casing' itself is the casing layer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise I'm not nitpicking, but it's much easier when everybody is on the same page as far as terms go.  The terminology as I stated above is standard in the commercial mushroom industry, as well as the way stamets and others have written.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5738741</next>\n<prev>5738664</prev>\n<first>5738578</first>\n<last>5740335</last>\n<when>1150066864</when>\n<utime>06/12/06 02:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
