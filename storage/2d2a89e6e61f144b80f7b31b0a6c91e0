Most commercial mushroom farms use it at that percentage. Composted cow manure from the nursery also works well when mixed with coir or verm to cut it a bit.  If any bulk substrate you mix up seems a bit 'heavy' just add ten to twenty percent verm to keep it nice and loose.  Another benefit of verm in bulk substrates is it makes an excellent moisture reservoir for use during fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7114749</next>\n<prev>7113948</prev>\n<first>7113625</first>\n<last>7115086</last>\n<when>1183298560</when>\n<utime>07/01/07 05:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
