Lowering your temperature in your FC with PF cakes even more(ex. from 70-75 down to 64-68)AT NIGHT with indirect SUNLIGHT(day) through a window for about 5 hours a day(remember youre FC protects youre cakes from the sun as well as the window) DOES ABSOLUTE WONDERS COME PINNING TIME! This isnt a fact, just personaly experience. Thank you guys so much for reading and i look forward to contributing accurate and helpful information to the epic shroomery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it's fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day/night temperature differential works wonders for a good pinset and healthy growth, as does some &lt;i&gt;direct sunlight&lt;/i&gt; every day.&amp;nbsp; I've long advised growers with stubborn substrates to put them out in direct sunlight for at least several minutes a day until pinning starts.&amp;nbsp; After that, bright fluorescent or bright indirect sunlight for several hours per day is needed.&amp;nbsp; A best-case scenario is a 12/12 light/dark cycle using lights, with a bit of direct/indirect sunlight tossed in during the 12 hour lighting time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>15672623</prev>\n<first>15662635</first>\n<last>15673300</last>\n<when>1326737976</when>\n<utime>01/16/12 08:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
