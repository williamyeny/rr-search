My recommendations are to use 3&quot; to 5&quot; of well drained perlite for terrariums.  Others disagree.  Choose the method you're happy with.  10&quot; height is too short for a terrarium anyway.  You need more room to dissipate and get rid of the metabolic gasses.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7902023</next>\n<prev>7901687</prev>\n<first>7901654</first>\n<last>7902236</last>\n<when>1200774887</when>\n<utime>01/19/08 10:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
