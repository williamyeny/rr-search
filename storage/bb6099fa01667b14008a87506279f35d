If it says &quot;Safer than hydrated lime&quot; on the bag, it's the WRONG type of lime.  Consider 2% Mg to be the upper limit.  Use HYDRATED LIME.  You don't want to adjust the pH of your casing material next year, you want to adjust the pH now.  That means using hydrated(water soluable) lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7151591</prev>\n<first>7150479</first>\n<last>7152169</last>\n<when>1184019416</when>\n<utime>07/10/07 01:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
