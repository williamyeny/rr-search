Try not to find drama where none exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ara16w said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR, here's an excellent thread on spotting the difference between mycelium, mold, and bacteria in LC's:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when that thread was new.&amp;nbsp; Again, there is no dependable way to spot and identify the thousands of fungi species which can inhabit a liquid culture other than the one you want to be growing.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it's vastly slower than growing from other proved methods and has a much higher rate of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, peroxide is just as toxic to one species of mycelium as another(with the exception of Dactylium which peroxide will kill if applied in open air). This means your mushroom mycelium is just as harmed as other organisms.&amp;nbsp; Further still, none of this is a concern with proper sterile procedure and using grain jars where contaminants can be seen and ID'd before transfer.&amp;nbsp; Grain jars will colonize with a thousand times as much mycelium in a fraction the time it takes LC to barely make enough for a syringe or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that LC never works, but that other procedures work much better.&amp;nbsp; You're free to follow other advice all you want, but don't get irritated with experienced members here trying to spread good information and counter all the bad that's out there being returned with search engine results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of search engine results, a simple search here will reveal at least ten LC fail threads for every LC success thread, and bear in mind people like to brag a lot more than they like to admit failure, so the ratio is even worse than it looks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16240739</next>\n<prev>16240435</prev>\n<first>16235951</first>\n<last>16306953</last>\n<when>1337203000</when>\n<utime>05/17/12 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
