I am interested in trying to use the peroxide tek but I only have spores to work with. i mean, if bleach is used, can you skip all the sterilizing and pressure cooking? anything to simplify the process would be appreciated.</blockquote><br />The original poster disappeared, never to be heard from again, three months after making this thread.&nbsp; Peroxide and/or bleach are not substitutes for pressure cooking.&nbsp; Neither bleach nor peroxide will kill all bacterial endospores.&nbsp; Soaking in bleach before pressure cooking would be like wearing a parachute in your car.&nbsp; It would serve no purpose.&nbsp; <br />This thread was started when that silly 'peroxide tek' was floating around, with some dude trying to charge $20 or more for a few pages printed off his computer showing how to use peroxide rather than sterilizing.&nbsp; It's horrible.&nbsp; I don't know of one single grower who tried it(including myself) who still thinks it's a viable technique.&nbsp; <br />RR"}}
