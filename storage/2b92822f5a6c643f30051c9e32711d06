Be sure to leave plenty of room in the top for a plenum of air.  You want to make sure the top of the bag is inflated, almost like a balloon before you seal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very important factor to remember, the larger the spawn bag, the drier you make your grains.  For very large bags, after the first shake, I lay the bag flat on it's back with the grains spread out, and the filter patch on top.  For smaller bags, they can stay sitting upright.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6349122</next>\n<prev>6348261</prev>\n<first>6345322</first>\n<last>6351006</last>\n<when>1165629320</when>\n<utime>12/09/06 03:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
