Vermiculite is used in the brf tek for the mineral content.&nbsp; No other replacement such as sawdust or manure will come close to the performance of vermiculite. Fungi can definitely use minerals.<br />If you have some Azomite, give it a try by adding a tablespoon or so to the amount you'd use for five brf tek jars and see how it works.&nbsp; I see no harm.<br />RR"}}
