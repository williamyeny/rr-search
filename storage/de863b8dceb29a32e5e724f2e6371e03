Upon full colonization, shake well to break up the kernels, then add sterilized, distilled water to the jar of grains and shake again.  Use syringes to draw the now myceliated water from the jar of grain.  This will give exponentially more LC syringes in two weeks than simply putting spores into honey or karo water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't use this method because I run all mycelium across agar to ensure that it's contaminant free before placing on grains.  However, if one wishes to skip the agar step, the above is one way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6364485</next>\n<prev>6364100</prev>\n<first>6363953</first>\n<last>9675333</last>\n<when>1165992182</when>\n<utime>12/13/06 08:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
