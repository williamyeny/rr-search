Do a search and read up on senescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've learned agar, you can make test tube slants for long term storage in the refrigerator. You'll only get into these once per year or so to go back to your master culture.  Cut a pinhead size piece of mycelium from the test tube and return the test tube back to cold storage. Use the small piece you cut from the test tube to grow out your LC or grain master, starting the process over again. Properly executed, this method will allow you to use an isolated strain for the rest of your life.  Stamet's p system of labeling cultures is based on this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't learned agar yet, just take a fully colonized wbs or rye jar and store it in the refrigerator.  Whenever your cultures get weak from expansion, simply get your master out of the fridge and use a tablespoon or so to start the next cycle, then return the grain master to the fridge.  Don't try to replace the grains you remove with fresh rye.  At least once every six months, start a new jar and when it finishes colonization, stick it in the fridge as your new master.  The limiting factor is that the rye or wbs won't last as long in the fridge as a test tube slant will.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's growing evidence that storing test tube slants with a 1cm layer of distilled water over them will keep the cultures fresh for five years or longer.  I have some experiments going on that now which are in the second year, still looking fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5734188</next>\n<prev>5733988</prev>\n<first>5733852</first>\n<last>5735393</last>\n<when>1149962111</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 08:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
