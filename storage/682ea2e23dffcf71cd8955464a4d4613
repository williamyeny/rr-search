It's totally bogus and ruins more crops than any other.  If I could remove that bogus tek, I would.  The convection caused by the hot oven creates airflow and turbulence that makes it the worst possible place to inoculate in.  Build a still-air glovebox, or work in a plastic trash bag or something that will contain drafts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you PC your 1/2 pint jars, 45 minutes is probably enough.  Pints should be PC'd for an hour, and if steaming, they need to go for 90 to 120 minutes &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the steam begins to escape from the lid of the pot.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7646425</next>\n<prev>7643098</prev>\n<first>7642179</first>\n<last>7646425</last>\n<when>1195233404</when>\n<utime>11/16/07 07:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
