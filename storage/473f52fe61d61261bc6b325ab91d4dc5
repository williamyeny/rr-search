By the time the center of an oven bag of substrate has heated to pasteurization temperature, you've already killed off the beneficial organisms that will help prevent molds later.&amp;nbsp; Pasteurize using water or steam as the heat-transfer mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, if your grow room area isn't clean, you'll have to vastly increase air exchange and circulation.&amp;nbsp; Stale, still air will stimulate mold and impeded mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12584033</next>\n<prev>12583963</prev>\n<first>12581116</first>\n<last>12588229</last>\n<when>1274187849</when>\n<utime>05/18/10 04:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
