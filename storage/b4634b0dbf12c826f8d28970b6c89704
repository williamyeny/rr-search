Growth is flat from 75F to 82F, and then begins falling off.  Below 75F and above 83F, growth is slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pf jars fully colonize in 2 1/2 to 3 weeks at 75F.  You're telling us they'll colonize in 5 to 7 days if I put them in an 'incubator'?  That's awfully hard to accept, and certainly doesn't match the experiences of myself and hundreds of members here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8478766</next>\n<prev>8478603</prev>\n<first>8477707</first>\n<last>8484428</last>\n<when>1212504870</when>\n<utime>06/03/08 05:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
