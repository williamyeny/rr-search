Then stored them (completely sealed off) until i was ready to mix in my vase. So far i see nothing oddly textured. Thanks for the info, fruiting them should be easy. Ill keep this updated with more pictures as it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not nearly enough so I doubt it will fully colonize without molding.&amp;nbsp; You want the center of the sawdust to be at 140F to 160F for 60 to 90 minutes.&amp;nbsp; You probably didn't even get it up to that temperature in an oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time if you're pasteurizing place the bag in a large pot of water and heat to a boil.&amp;nbsp; Let boil until your meat thermometer in the center of the bag starts to move off the bottom peg.&amp;nbsp; At that point, reduce the setting on the stove to stop the boil, but keep it hot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjust as necessary to keep the center at the correct temperature range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also next time, get some citric acid or lemon juice to reduce the pH of the sawdust to around 4.&amp;nbsp; The mycelium will glow much brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt seriously they'll fruit in that bowl.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>19005451</prev>\n<first>19000641</first>\n<last>19006030</last>\n<when>1382325919</when>\n<utime>10/21/13 06:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
