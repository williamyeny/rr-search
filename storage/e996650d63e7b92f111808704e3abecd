{"key":"post-5106572","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5106572</id>\n<content>The prefilter you see in the picture above is 10 X 24, and as you can see, only half the prefilter is being used.  The other half is still in its box.  When it gets dirty, I remove it from the box and turn it around to use the other end.  A 10 X 10 would work fine.  The larger prefilters are for if you're going to build a box for the filter to set in.  I found that unnecessary.  My setup looks ghetto, but works fine.  Been using it for five years now.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5105941</prev>\n<first>5105211</first>\n<last>5106572</last>\n<when>1135592017</when>\n<utime>12/26/05 12:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
