I don't doubt that there are problems with compatibility, but I think they're unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show me.&amp;nbsp; I've seen lots of posts where they used very dark syringes and got fast colonization, but the overwhelming majority of them never post again after that because fruiting performance was poor.&amp;nbsp; Compatibility is a HUGE problem.&amp;nbsp; We knew that even 20+ years ago when paul stamets wrote TMC, where he advised against massive spore inoculation.&amp;nbsp; Since that time, it's been confirmed thousands of times.&amp;nbsp; The few success stories are the exception, rather than the rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HybridprX said:&lt;br /&gt;Darker syringes work just fine and infact grain spawn masters prepared with pigmented spore solution can be g2g more times then grain spawn masters prepared with clearer solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is absolutely incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9597318</next>\n<prev>9596700</prev>\n<first>9594584</first>\n<last>9601317</last>\n<when>1231812125</when>\n<utime>01/13/09 04:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
