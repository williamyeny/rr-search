So is coir, worm castings, coffee grinds, hemp fiber, seeweed, cotton seed hulls, etc.  There are lots of things you can use as a bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use whatever you can get and work with.  Potency has nothing to do with substrate.  Different substrates may give larger or smaller fruits, with straw probably giving some of the largest because the hollow stems hold so much water, but potency is genetic, not substrate related.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6151898</next>\n<prev>6151657</prev>\n<first>6151120</first>\n<last>6152407</last>\n<when>1160449688</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 06:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
