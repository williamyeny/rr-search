Use it at full strength. It comes pre diluted. If you want a super disinfectant &lt;br /&gt;spray the surface with vinegar, then H2O2, but don't mix the two in the same bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important to remember that not everyone is in the US where peroxide is sold in brown bottles at 3%.&amp;nbsp; It's much stronger in some countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the salad thing, it's a mistake to assume that killing every organism on food is a good thing.&amp;nbsp; We want to get rid of e coli and like, but not everything.&amp;nbsp; We don't live in a sterile world.&amp;nbsp; I doubt that peroxide and vinegar would get rid of pesticide residue, but washing does, and I know that running water will remove e coli and salmonella bacteria from food.&amp;nbsp; As for killing 100,000 organisms, bear in mind we have more bacteria cells in our bodies than human cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, use peroxide to control cobweb mold, but it has little other benefit.&amp;nbsp; Some use it as a surface disinfectant, but for sterile work, I prefer to wash my glass table top and surgical gloves with alcohol and/or Lysol.&amp;nbsp; Never spray peroxide on mycelium without a darn good reason.&amp;nbsp; It shocks the mycelium, setting it back and leaving an opening for competitors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14708751</next>\n<prev>14708582</prev>\n<first>14708446</first>\n<last>21358867</last>\n<when>1309664119</when>\n<utime>07/03/11 06:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
