Incidentally, I've typed this many, many times, but taping over holes in a shotgun terrarium LOWERS humidity, not raises it. I live in a high elevation mountain desert and my ambient humidity in the summer runs around 15% and in the winter at -30F, all the moisture is squeezed out of the air.&amp;nbsp; I have no trouble at all maintaining 90% and greater humidity in a shotgun terrarium.&amp;nbsp; When I first designed that system, I lived in Seattle and thought it probably needed 35% or so ambient humidity to keep up.&amp;nbsp; However, since moving to the high desert mountains of eastern Washington, I have learned otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I am building a commercial mushroom farm up here that uses no humidifiers or other mechanical means.&amp;nbsp; I spray gravel on the floor with water once every two days, and humidity stays in the upper 90s, even when it's 10% or less outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suspect you're either not misting properly, or you have a faulty hygrometer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10947216</next>\n<prev>10947108</prev>\n<first>10942531</first>\n<last>10948366</last>\n<when>1251385430</when>\n<utime>08/27/09 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
