The end result is your stove will be on 'high' until pressure is reached, at which time it will be reduced to the minimum setting that will maintain 15 psi, which may not be the lowest setting on your stove. The only way to know when the proper pressure is reached, is to have the instruction manual.  I'd suggest looking for one with a gauge.<br />RR"}}
