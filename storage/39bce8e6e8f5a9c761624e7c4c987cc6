Perhaps there's a reason the jar didn't finish?  It could be too wet or dry, or there might be some bacterial contamination.  Normally, even if you expose to light the entire time, pinning won't start until full colonization and an increase in air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes however, you have a super strain that pins like crazy.  If that's the case, be sure to save it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can birth the jar if it finishes colonization.  Birthing rarely aborts the pins, but if it does, new ones will take their place.  As said above, it's nothing to freak out about.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5809129</next>\n<prev>5809085</prev>\n<first>5809004</first>\n<last>5809154</last>\n<when>1151760892</when>\n<utime>07/01/06 04:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
