There's a lot of lime and other chemicals used in pulp production and papermaking.  I don't know if that's the cause or not, but I've found prints taken on foil last MUCH longer than prints taken on paper.  You can use the same methods, just with foil instead of paper.  I'd tear a foot or so off the roll first, and save it for the kitchen, then use the clean foil beyond that point for your prints.  I prefer to cover the printing cap with a tyvek sheet.  I buy tyvek coveralls at the hardware store, and unzip them and do the printing on foil inside the torso area, then I zip it back up.  You can tie knots in the arms and legs, and hood, so it totally seals your printing area up, yet still can breathe so bacteria is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6609924</next>\n<prev>6609868</prev>\n<first>6609868</first>\n<last>6611199</last>\n<when>1172455771</when>\n<utime>02/26/07 04:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
