Wait until you have several hundred going at once.  You'll have a ton of cash invested, then when you accidentally knock a stack over, half of them break.  They're also heavy to pick up when inoculating and you need to lift a stack of ten.  That causes them to slip out of your gloved hands.  They're a pain in the ass to clean up and re-PC, while the sterile plastic dishes can be had for 5 cents each here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cenmed.com/showDetails.asp?item=6141&amp;amp;mainCat=LS&amp;amp;category=565&amp;amp;pagename=searchresults.asp.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.cenmed.com/showDetails.asp?it...rchresults.asp.&lt;/a&gt;  I seriously doubt you can wash and re-PC a glass dish for 5 cents.  You probably only got the bottoms because the other guy already broke all the lids.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3965096</next>\n<prev>3964797</prev>\n<first>3964709</first>\n<last>3965522</last>\n<when>1111697022</when>\n<utime>03/24/05 10:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
