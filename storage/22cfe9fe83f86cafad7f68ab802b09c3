First, condensation is an indication of a temperature differential between the two sides of the terrarium.  Condensation forms on the warm side.  That's why your windows, toilet bowl, and can of beer get condensation on them.  It has nothing to do with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, light doesn't become a pinning trigger until full colonization, and then it's a secondary trigger, not the main one.
