Thats like saying people in ethiopia could get them at 1 cent our money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a no shitter.  They may pay a bit more for jars and tubs, but get free medical care.  Mrs Rabbits cancer treatment just took nearly $200,000 right out of our pocket.  That was our life savings and retirement money, so now we're broke, as I rapidly approach retirment age.  I'd gladly pay twice the price for a tub, to have their medical system instead of the corrupt one in the US.  It's all relative.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6888804</next>\n<prev>6888724</prev>\n<first>6887937</first>\n<last>6889427</last>\n<when>1178644637</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 08:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
