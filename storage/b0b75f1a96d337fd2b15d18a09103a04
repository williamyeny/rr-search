Sometimes when typing I toss things in that I assume would be known.  You need a meat thermometer the first time or two you do that procedure. You can get one for five bucks or less at the grocery store. The weight or lid on/off has nothing to do with the moisture content of your jars.  You need to get that adjusted prior to heat treating.<br />I did a video tek on this procedure for my upcoming dvd, so when I get it finished and released it will help the visual learners I'm sure to see the actual procedure and watch the thermometer.<br />Put a meat thermometer into the center of one of your jars of substrate/casing.  You don't need a lid on the jar if you don't want, foil works just as well.  Stick the meat thermometer through the foil and into the center of the jar.<br />Have COLD water in the kettle or PC 2/3 of the way up the jars.  Turn on the stove.  Allow the water to boil JUST until the thermometer in the jar reads 140F/60C.  Shut off the stove and start your timer for 1 hour.   The jar will continue to heat to around 150F to 160F, then begin to decrease.  If the temp drops to 140F prior to one hour, simply turn on the stove and bring it back up again.  At the end of one hour, the jars can be removed, and in another couple of hours they'll be cool enough to use.<br />RR"}}
