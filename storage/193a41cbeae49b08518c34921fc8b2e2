Get rid of the light bulb 'heat', and make sure you have a period of darkness.  12/12 works fine.  Make sure the sunlight is not direct or it will dry out your cakes.  The size of the mushrooms is related to moisture content, so your cakes are too dry.  You can pile up some verm on the top of the cake, and then pour water into that during the flush.  This will serve as a moisture reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7454544</prev>\n<first>7452992</first>\n<last>7454594</last>\n<when>1190810081</when>\n<utime>09/26/07 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
