I'll be trying to slug mine down with water or lemonaid while my face turns green, and she's over there going hmmmm, these are delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cooked them on the grill before, after rubbing them with blue cheese salad dressing.  The caps are better for this than the stems.  Done this way, they really are good.  Try it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6228560</next>\n<prev>6227618</prev>\n<first>6226724</first>\n<last>6229844</last>\n<when>1162265651</when>\n<utime>10/31/06 05:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
