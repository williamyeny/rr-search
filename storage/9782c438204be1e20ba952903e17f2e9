I disagree with the technique of printing under a glass.  I'd suggest laying a sheet of tyvek over the printing caps.  All you want is to keep dust off and restrict drafts.  A glass can tend to keep the caps too wet, and bacteria may bloom.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7504394</next>\n<prev>7504368</prev>\n<first>7504268</first>\n<last>7504733</last>\n<when>1192021563</when>\n<utime>10/10/07 04:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
