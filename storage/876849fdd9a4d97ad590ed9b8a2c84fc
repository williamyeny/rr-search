You'd probably get better results to leave it partly open all the time, regardless of the instructions they gave.  If it's pinning/fruiting, it needs air exchange.   Also, contaminants are encouraged by stale air, so air exchange reduces the chances of bad thing happening, not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5983930</next>\n<prev>5983868</prev>\n<first>5980764</first>\n<last>5987338</last>\n<when>1156189573</when>\n<utime>08/21/06 10:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
