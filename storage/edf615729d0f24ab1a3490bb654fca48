Don't get fresh manure from the pile they make when they clean out the stalls.  To tell if a nugget is aged properly, pick it up in the field and break in half.  It should look like compressed hay, and be completely dry.  If it's still green, or slimy/wet inside, it's not ready.  There should also be no smell from the thing other than a hay/dirt scent.  If it stinks, don't take it.<br />RR"}}
