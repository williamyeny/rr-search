Take it back to topia or wherever you got ran off from before you landed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemical fertilizers are not food for fungi as you claim them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minerals are food for fungi which you claim them not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you get off the couch and study a bit of mycology.&amp;nbsp; Absent that, try growing something but the easiest mushroom in the world to grow so you have a knowledge base to lean on. You don't see too many expert bikers teaching tricks to new riders while they still have training wheels bolted to their back axle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all you know how to grow is cubes, try growing them on BRF cakes, keeping them healthy for a few flushes.&amp;nbsp; They'll shrink to much less than the original quantity of the vermiculite alone, as can easily be determined with a scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weigh the dry ingredients before making the cakes and then dry and weigh them after several flushes.&amp;nbsp; The weight of the dry mycelium, what's left of the rice flour, and the verm will be less than the original weight of just the vermiculite.&amp;nbsp; This could only happen if the verm was being consumed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19542699</next>\n<prev>19542652</prev>\n<first>19511982</first>\n<last>24817404</last>\n<when>1391952564</when>\n<utime>02/09/14 03:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
