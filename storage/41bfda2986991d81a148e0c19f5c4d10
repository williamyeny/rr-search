It's best if it's shining in through the side walls of the terrarium. If directly up, it will reflect off the perlite and fruits low on the cakes will turn downward.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15492814</next>\n<prev>15492089</prev>\n<first>15491366</first>\n<last>15492927</last>\n<when>1323478071</when>\n<utime>12/10/11 02:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
