Personally, I like the rinse, soak, simmer, drain and load method although it's more work.  Of course, even with that method, you'll have to experiment a bit.  If your grain comes out too wet or dry, fix whatever is wrong on the next batch.  After a few times, it becomes automatic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, preparing your grain jars slightly on the dry side results in a bit faster colonization.  This isn't a problem if you're using them as spawn to bulk substrates, but if you plan to fruit from only the cased grains, performance will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5834963</next>\n<prev>5827190</prev>\n<first>5819090</first>\n<last>24041699</last>\n<when>1152204931</when>\n<utime>07/06/06 07:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
