Don't eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are often food.  Most, but not all of us have blue cheese salad dressing in our refrigerators and think nothing of eating it. I love to rub blue cheese dressing into a portabello mushroom, then put it on the grill with my steaks.  Guess what makes blue cheese blue? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbluecheese.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbluecheese.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for physical differences, molds are a fungi, and have mycelium similar to our beloved fungi.  They sporulate in the imperfect state, meaning they don't need a fruiting body to drop spores.   Some mold spores are dangerous if you breathe them, so don't sniff mouldy substrates, especially if you have AIDS or an otherwise compromised immune system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria looks like a slime, and has an unpleasant smell, sort of like old wine, or rotten apples.  Don't eat bacteria unless you like being sick.  If you've ever had what is commonly called the '24 hour flu', you had food poisoning.  It's caused by bacteria in food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5961162</prev>\n<first>5961162</first>\n<last>5961298</last>\n<when>1155536252</when>\n<utime>08/14/06 09:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
