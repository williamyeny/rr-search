Personally, I don't let caps sit for more than 12 hours during printing because I don't want bacteria to be able to form in the stale air beneath the cap as it prints.  The good news this way is you can get two prints from each cap. Although they will be lighter prints, they will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5340422</prev>\n<first>5340407</first>\n<last>5340487</last>\n<when>1140973406</when>\n<utime>02/26/06 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
