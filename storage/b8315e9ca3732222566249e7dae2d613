The guy Stamets quoted in his book found &lt;i&gt;86F to give the fastest linear growth on a petri dish&lt;/i&gt; where no heat was produced by the mycelium.  In the three dimensional space of a substrate or jar, the mycelium produces heat on its own.  Mycelial growth declines rapidly at 86F and above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you guys a story. My fellow moderator Roadkill and I were filming a video segment on pf jars over at my brother's house a month or two ago.  Later that day, my &lt;i&gt;non-mycologist&lt;/i&gt; brother moved everything we left behind out to his garage, jars included, just to get them out of the way.  I told him it didn't really matter as I just wanted to film the process of making/inoculating the jars.  Three weeks later, I went over there and guess what?  All of the jars were fully colonized.  The temperature of his garage during this time varied from the mid 30's to the low 50's.(He lives about 50 miles from the Canadian border)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if properly made pf jars can colonize in three weeks at those low temps, why bother with silly incubators?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6455482</next>\n<prev>6455412</prev>\n<first>6454757</first>\n<last>6455724</last>\n<when>1168717772</when>\n<utime>01/13/07 09:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
