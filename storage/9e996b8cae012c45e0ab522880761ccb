Boiling will sterilize it, not pasteurize, and invite bad things to happen.&amp;nbsp; Nothing &quot;leaches&quot; out that matters, most substrates are nutrient heavy and the shrooms don't need or want it that way since it invites competition, they want it &quot;just right&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And your source for all that is. . .?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem with people who want to contradict what 40 years of growing mushrooms has taught me, but to simply state bad info as if it were fact with zero evidence other than you typed it, is going over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Field capacity is extremely easy to obtain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutrients do leach out when substrates are soaked in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your claim that substrates are 'nutrient heavy' was not substantiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You claim boiling will 'sterilize' it, inviting contamination, and then you go on to claim that pouring boiling water over a substrate will get it 'just right'. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17116435</next>\n<prev>17116406</prev>\n<first>17115693</first>\n<last>17123313</last>\n<when>1351435438</when>\n<utime>10/28/12 05:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
