{"key":"post-6670850","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6670850</id>\n<content>Some strains just don't attach well to the substrate, therefore they tend to pick themselves by falling over.  Other strains are so well attached they leave a huge divot when you pick them.  Multispore inoculation will give one strain one time and the opposite the next.  It's just the luck of the draw.  It's not related to anything you're doing, except handling them.  They prefer to be left alone.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6671566</next>\n<prev>6669456</prev>\n<first>6668602</first>\n<last>6671566</last>\n<when>1173932502</when>\n<utime>03/15/07 07:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
