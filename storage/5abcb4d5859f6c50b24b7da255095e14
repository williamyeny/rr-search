That is the key.  There seems to be some controversy and disagreement over whether or not misting will abort small pins.  My experience is that it does, but other growers mist pins and have no problems.  The quality of the mister itself might be the factor.  Mine shoots a fairly fine mist, but every once in a while, a huge drop or two pukes out.  If one of these large drops lands on a pin, it will abort.  After primordia form, I mist the casing material very carefully to avoid getting mist on the pins.  Other species, such as oyster mushrooms love to be misted directly.<br />RR"}}
