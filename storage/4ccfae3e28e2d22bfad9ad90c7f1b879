Make sure air can get in and out.  Lift it up to mist, and replace with a clean sheet every second day.  Wrinkling it up gives lots of air passages to make sure you still get air flow, while maintaining high humidity.  I've actually fruited in the open air with wax paper.  The fruits push the wax paper out of the way as they grow, yet it still holds enough humidity to keep the caps from cracking.  It will get you out of a bind if you run out of FC space.<br />RR"}}
