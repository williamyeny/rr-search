Now, I have 3 cakes that are about 90% done... however the rest are between 60-80%, and 20-40% colonized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You better start over.&amp;nbsp; There is no excuse for a properly made brf cake in the correct sized jars taking longer than three weeks to fully colonize.&amp;nbsp; If it does, something is very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14092794</next>\n<prev>14091360</prev>\n<first>14091031</first>\n<last>14092815</last>\n<when>1299689653</when>\n<utime>03/09/11 06:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
