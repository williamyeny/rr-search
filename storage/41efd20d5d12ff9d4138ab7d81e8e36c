Over 90% of the contaminants in a room are within a foot or two of the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said 'direct' sunlight is bad.  Diffused is not, nor is fluorescent.  My jars are exposed to fluorescent office type lighting for up to 18 hours a day, and longer if I'm working late.  It has no effect on colonizing mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closets are also horrible places to put fruiting chambers.  Leave the door open to ensure fresh air, as it can get stale fast in a closed up closet and contaminants thrive in still, stale, damp air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6861294</next>\n<prev>6859073</prev>\n<first>6858842</first>\n<last>6871353</last>\n<when>1178068186</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 04:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
