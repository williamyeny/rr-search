{"key":"post-5936816","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5936816</id>\n<content>Don't recycle jars.  'Sterilization' is relative and never complete.  It gives us a 'window of opportunity' for our mycelium to capture the substrate.  Toss out the contents of old jars and make up fresh ones for each batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark is overrated.  Normal room lighting has little to no effect on colonizing mycelium.  Light only becomes a pinning trigger when it's in conjunction with full colonization and an increase in air exchange with a corresponding decrease in CO2 levels.  I've allowed jars to colonize on an open shelf at normal indoor room temperature and normal indoor room lighting for years with no adverse results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5936756</prev>\n<first>5936644</first>\n<last>5936816</last>\n<when>1154888051</when>\n<utime>08/06/06 09:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
