And perhaps it is also pushed up by the heat from the substrates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guessing here... I do not know. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/confused.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:confused:&quot; title=&quot;:confused:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very close.&amp;nbsp; The air is warmer near the ceiling due to heat from the substrates.&amp;nbsp; Since hot air rises, and this has much more effect than the slightly higher molecular weight of the CO2, the CO2/air mix rides up on the currents.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, humid air is less dense than dry air, thus the circulation is always from lower to higher in grow rooms and chambers. This is what makes a shotgun terrarium function as opposed to the often-repeated but incorrect assumption that CO2 'drains out' the bottom.(which it does not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is the lower density of humid air(which causes it to rise) and the rising warm air overcomes the extra weight of the CO2 laden air, carrying it along(and upwards) for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17142228</next>\n<prev>17142171</prev>\n<first>17136663</first>\n<last>17142254</last>\n<when>1351795126</when>\n<utime>11/01/12 09:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
