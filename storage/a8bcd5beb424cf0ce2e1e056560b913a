Gypsum adds calcium and also helps to keep your grains from clumping up.  It's a great addition to all grains, including wbs.  You are correct, add the gypsum to the soak water.  When I make up ten quart jars of grains, I soak the ten cups of grain in 3 1/2 gallons of water with a tablespoon of gypsum mixed in well. Since I personally always presoak the grains in weak coffee, I add 1/4 teaspoon of hydrated lime as well.  If you soak in plain water, skip the lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3972412</next>\n<prev>3972304</prev>\n<first>3972304</first>\n<last>3972823</last>\n<when>1111866052</when>\n<utime>03/26/05 09:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
