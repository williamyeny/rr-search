You need air exchange as much as high humidity.  Air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap your hygrometer up in a damp bath towel and leave it for one hour.  Unwrap and adjust the screw on the back so it reads 98%.  If there's no adjusting screw on the back, toss it in the trash and go to a cigar shop in your local area and buy a hygrometer.  I get good ones from my local neighborhood cigar shop for twenty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6621238</next>\n<prev>6621053</prev>\n<first>6600786</first>\n<last>6631761</last>\n<when>1172704423</when>\n<utime>03/01/07 01:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
