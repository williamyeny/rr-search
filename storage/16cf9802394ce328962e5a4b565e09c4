I am going to move my terrarium to my closet and basically build it a small dark area with a led lamp indirectly supplying light in the area, but I think the way for me to get consistent 10-12 or less hours of light will be to have the lamp on at night and off during the day. Is this a bad idea? Should I just save myself some time and be patient with the current setup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;Closets are horrible places to grow due to lack of fresh air.&amp;nbsp; Keep your terrarium in bright light during daylight hours.&amp;nbsp; The exact timing isn't as critical as with plants, but see to it they get a few hours of bright light(even a few minutes of direct sunlight is good) and the rest of the time they'll be fine with just your room light.&amp;nbsp; If you need extra, get a clamp-on fixture and screw a daylight/6500K CFL into it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19222232</next>\n<prev>19219914</prev>\n<first>19219487</first>\n<last>19222232</last>\n<when>1386074210</when>\n<utime>12/03/13 02:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
