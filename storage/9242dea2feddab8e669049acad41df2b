Add the gypsum and bran to the dry sawdust, then hydrate and mix at a ratio of twice as much sawdust by volume as chips.  Wheat bran and gypsum both work well at ten percent by volume.  Depending on species, you can go up to 20% wheat bran to volume of sawdust, but don't go over that.  If growing shiitake, use less, or you'll get lots of mutants and aborts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood chips can be soaked for 24 hours or boiled for one hour to hydrate.  I prefer boiling.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7982863</next>\n<prev>7967393</prev>\n<first>7107814</first>\n<last>7991812</last>\n<when>1201966809</when>\n<utime>02/02/08 05:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
