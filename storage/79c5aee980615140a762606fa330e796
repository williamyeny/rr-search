{"key":"post-10479326","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>10479326</id>\n<content>I know of no professional mycologists who suggest switching agar media.&amp;nbsp; I've read it in the same books you have, but the fact remains, our cultures are only on agar after being pulled from the master slant for a matter of a week or two before transferring to grains, and my ten to twenty year old cultures grow like a bat out of hell when they come out of refrigeration, even though they're on the same MEA I use for the master slants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senescence is caused by an excess of cell divisions, not being 'used' to this or that food. Sometimes an author takes a wild guess at something, and his mistake gets repeated for many years if he's a respected person, OR if he authored one of the only commonly used books on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since professional growers don't clone multiple times, but rather store young cell lines under refrigeration where most cell division stops or greatly slows down, it's a moot point anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fungi spores travel across the ocean on currents, with mold spores from Asia commonly reported in Hawaii. These spores then germinate and grow, crossing with the established mycelium in their 'new home'. The current marketing convention of naming strains after the place they were picked is lame.&amp;nbsp; I've seen no difference in wild picked cubensis from Texas, Florida, SE Asia, or South Africa.&amp;nbsp; They look the same, feel the same, and taste the same all within the normal variations we all see on every grow.&amp;nbsp; The idea that a cubensis picked in Cambodia is going to be substantially different and require or prefer a different food from a cubensis from Texas just doesn't hold water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10479413</next>\n<prev>10478732</prev>\n<first>10465704</first>\n<last>10482743</last>\n<when>1244601429</when>\n<utime>06/10/09 05:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
