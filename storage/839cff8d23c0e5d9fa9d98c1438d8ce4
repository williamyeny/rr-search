Normally, we inject the spores against the edge of the jar, so we see the growth right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At day 23, properly prepared pf cakes should be at or near full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom growth slows down dramatically at any temp above 83F, so you're definitely hurting them by the excess heat.  You shouldn't let the temp in your incubator exceed 81F.  I use an open shelf at normal room temp and pf jars colonize fully in less than 23 days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6947227</next>\n<prev>6947216</prev>\n<first>6947200</first>\n<last>6948319</last>\n<when>1179774931</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 10:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
