The casing is only the non-nutritious top layer added to the top of the &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt; after full colonization.  Don't refer to the whole project as a 'casing'.  That's an improper use of nomenclature.  If everyone would stop doing that, new folks wouldn't get so confused about casing.   The word 'casings' in the plural should never be used.  If more than one substrate tray is cased, the correct term would be 'cased sustrates'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6871929</next>\n<prev>6871698</prev>\n<first>6871698</first>\n<last>6881972</last>\n<when>1178298350</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 08:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
