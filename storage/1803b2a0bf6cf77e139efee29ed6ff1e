I mixed 1 cup of brown rice flower, 3 cups of verm and 1 cup of water. I dispensed this into 6 1/2pint jars. Next I put the lids on the jars but kind of loose. Put the jars in a pot (not sitting on the bottom), and boiled for an hour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That dumb guide has you doing almost every thing wrong.&amp;nbsp; You've already been told the correct recipe.&amp;nbsp; You don't 'boil' for an hour.&amp;nbsp; You 'vent steam' for 90 minutes.&amp;nbsp; The steam doesn't start to escape from the lid until at least ten minutes after the water starts boiling.&amp;nbsp; When pure steam escapes, start the timer for 90 minutes. Screw the lids down tight. Keep the jars totally elevated out of the water.&amp;nbsp; The steam is what you want in contact with the jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14912663</next>\n<prev>14907364</prev>\n<first>14907348</first>\n<last>14912772</last>\n<when>1313102496</when>\n<utime>08/12/11 01:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
