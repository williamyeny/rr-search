A colonizing substrate needs gas exchange, but not air exchange, so only have a couple of pin sized holes, or let the gasses escape around the edges where the foil is crimped onto the tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your substrate at field capacity moisture level, that's plenty for colonization.  A substrate that is wet will not colonize well, if at all.  Just keep it covered and let it colonize. Don't mist. A substrate a bit on the dry side will colonize faster and be more resistant to contaminant molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6198050</next>\n<prev>6196784</prev>\n<first>6196784</first>\n<last>6200893</last>\n<when>1161526433</when>\n<utime>10/22/06 05:13 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
