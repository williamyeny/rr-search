A pressurized plenum is the way you get the exact same amount of pressure on the entire back side, ensuring laminar flow out the front side.&nbsp; Build a plywood box to house the filter if you want to go cheap, or use hardwood planed planks glued together if you're a woodworker and want to build a piece of furniture you can be proud of.<br />Search here for flowhood plans.&nbsp; I've typed the calculations to determine the blower size in CFM @ 1\" static pressure for a 2 X 4 blower so many times that it's not necessary to repeat them all again.<br />RR"}}
