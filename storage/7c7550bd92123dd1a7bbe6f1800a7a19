Simply dunk to rehydrate the substrate and return to fruiting conditions.<br />I used to recommend dunking in the refrigerator, because in part, that was the conventional wisdom.  I no longer believe that's the best course of action, so dunk at normal room temperature, beginning the dunk with cold tap water, but no ice.  <br />Larger trays can be easily soaked by placing under the kitchen or bathtub faucet, allowing the tray to fill up and gently run over the edge for a few hours.
