Don't make the mistake of thinking in a few months of growing you've learned all there is to learn.  Wait until you've had a big trich outbreak and then every project takes a dive.  You'll be screaming for some lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum has been proved by commercial farms for many years to provide up to a 25% to 35% boost in yields over not using it.  If you don't have your substrates tweaked in yet, don't knock gypsum.  Once you get the best possible substrate mix, gypsum will add considerably to yields.  That's a fact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6387893</next>\n<prev>6387602</prev>\n<first>6387321</first>\n<last>6388133</last>\n<when>1166580457</when>\n<utime>12/20/06 04:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
