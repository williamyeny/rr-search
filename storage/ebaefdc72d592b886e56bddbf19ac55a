You can have 100% humidity in a tub and if the inside and outside temperature are the same, there will be no condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Misting the sides of a terrarium does nothing but waste water, and if it runs down the sides and into the substrate can lead to contamination.&amp;nbsp; You're supposed to mist the substrate directly since that's where the moisture is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; There's probably more crap posted by noobs without a clue above but that's enough for now.&amp;nbsp; If you have a flashing avatar or signature, get rid of it.&amp;nbsp; That bullshit has no place in a mycology forum.&amp;nbsp; Save that childish crap for OTD or send me a prescription for morphine to alleviate the migraines you intentionally cause.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17041351</next>\n<prev>17041315</prev>\n<first>17038741</first>\n<last>17047712</last>\n<when>1350407935</when>\n<utime>10/16/12 08:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
