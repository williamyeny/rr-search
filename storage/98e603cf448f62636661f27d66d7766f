They don't use spores to grow shiitake.  Paul has corrected this in his seminars and public appearances ever since the book came out.  You can't take what you read in any book and use it as a definitive answer.<br />I challenge anyone to take a sporeprint from a shiitake mushroom and grow a crop from it.  It won't happen, regardless of how many spores you use.<br />RR"}}
