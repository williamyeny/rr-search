You can't beat grains, especially rye for spawn. Cubes fruit on dung and/or straw better than any other substrate.  Wood is a bulk substrate material for. . .woodlovers such as P nameko, P cyans, shiitake, azures, etc.  Oyster mushrooms seem to be able to cross over and fruit well on straw or wood, but few other species will, including cubes.  Even for growing woodlovers, grain spawn is the proved favorite simply because it works best of all the hundreds of possible substrates tried.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6357331</next>\n<prev>6357201</prev>\n<first>6357182</first>\n<last>22907949</last>\n<when>1165855808</when>\n<utime>12/11/06 06:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
