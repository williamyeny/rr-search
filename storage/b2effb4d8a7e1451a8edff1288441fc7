Some strains are non-compatible, but most are. You don't need monokaryons to cross strains.&amp;nbsp; Dikaryons will also cross with other dikaryons and monokaryons, provided they're the same specie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just toss your spent cakes into the same pile.&amp;nbsp; Some will mix and some won't, but it doesn't matter.&amp;nbsp; At least some will fruit if it's still warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8968234</next>\n<prev>8967991</prev>\n<first>8967951</first>\n<last>8979722</last>\n<when>1222109603</when>\n<utime>09/22/08 09:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
