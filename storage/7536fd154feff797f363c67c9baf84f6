You remind me of one of those religious fanatics who is always trying to force the rest of us into his narrow frame of mind without the slightest bit of evidence other than, &quot;I say so and if you don't believe it, you're a quack&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has said there is a lunar effect on fungi, and I've personally never seen one.  This thread is to reflect on the possibility, not to hear your close minded insults based on personal dogma on every page.  Back out now if you have no evidence to back your emphatic claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use your common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is exactly what prevented early mariners from sailing too far out to sea.
