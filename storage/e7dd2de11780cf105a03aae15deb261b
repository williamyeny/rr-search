Leave them in the bag they came in until they are IN your glovebox or in front of a flow hood.  Wrap with parafilm, four squares per dish as soon as you inoculate.  There is absolutely no reason to worry about keeping petri dishes in the dark.  Light has zero effect on agar or colonizing mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5664789</next>\n<prev>5664624</prev>\n<first>5664283</first>\n<last>5664789</last>\n<when>1148416727</when>\n<utime>05/23/06 11:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
