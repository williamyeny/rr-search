Personally, I get the moisture right prior to pasteurization, then load the hydrated mix into jars or plastic bags, and pasteurize in a large pot of water.  Use a meat thermometer stuck into the center of the substrate and begin timing when the temperature reaches 140F, and remove from the heat an hour after that time.  Try not to let it exceed 160F at any time.  As soon as the jars have cooled, they're ready to inoculate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6638561</next>\n<prev>6638149</prev>\n<first>6638149</first>\n<last>6639594</last>\n<when>1173139789</when>\n<utime>03/06/07 02:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
