{"key":"post-5926580","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5926580</id>\n<content>One of the secrets of grain preparation, regardless of which grain, is to rinse the kernels very well before continuing with whatever preparation tek you're going to use.  All grains get packaged with a lot of chaff and grain dust that if not rinsed out will cause the grains to stick together later and cause that sticky goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put your dry grains in a large kettle and fill with water as you stir it around.  You'll see all the dust and other crap come floating up.  Slowly dump out the water to get rid of the junk and repeat two more times or until the water pours off clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding gypsum as prisoner1 said is also a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take anyone a few tries to get the moisure content right, regardless of which grain or which tek you follow.  If it's too wet this time, make adjustments next time, and so on until you work out your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame your needle and use it right away.  The first drop or two of solution will cool the needle without wasting too many spores.  As said, if you hold it until cool, it's likely to get contaminated again.  I feel it's best to sacrifice a few spores/solution to avoid the problem.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5926494</prev>\n<first>5922634</first>\n<last>5926580</last>\n<when>1154568752</when>\n<utime>08/03/06 04:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
