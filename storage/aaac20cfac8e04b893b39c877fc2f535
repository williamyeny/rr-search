A few growers have reported success with it, but most report bacterial contamination prior to full colonization.  For some reason, the bacterial endospores in feed corn are often tough enough to withstand 2 hours in the PC.  It helps to soak in warm water for 48 hours first.  This germinates those endospores to make them easier to kill in the Pressure Cooker.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3956249</next>\n<prev>3955691</prev>\n<first>3955444</first>\n<last>3956287</last>\n<when>1111549878</when>\n<utime>03/23/05 05:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
