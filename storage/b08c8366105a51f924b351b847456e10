An open room is better in my opinion because the filter material on the jar will be able to stay totally dry.  A jar in water or near water with a fish tank heater can easily contaminate with bacteria if the filter material gets damp.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6056606</next>\n<prev>6056494</prev>\n<first>6056468</first>\n<last>6056606</last>\n<when>1158160354</when>\n<utime>09/13/06 06:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
