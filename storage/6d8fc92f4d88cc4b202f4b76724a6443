I got a whole tractor-trailer load of straw delivered to my place way out in BFE for $700. The only reason for using coir in this hobby is if you live in the middle of a concrete jungle with no way out.&amp;nbsp; In fact, even downtown Seattle has a feed store with 60 pound bales of straw for $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check feed stores in your local area.&amp;nbsp; I've used wheat, oat, barley and rice straw with success.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12230033</next>\n<prev>12229935</prev>\n<first>12229783</first>\n<last>12232321</last>\n<when>1269013622</when>\n<utime>03/19/10 06:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
