I'm on my phone atm and don't have the link, but I'll edit that into my post when I'm home tonight since I feel like that relates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, and it made Bob the laughing stock of the mushroom community.&amp;nbsp; He never got over it, especially the anger when folks didn't accept a rare, but known mutation as a new species.&amp;nbsp; Redboy is also a red spore dropping P cubensis, and there was untold flaming back and forth between McPherson and Peele over which one had found the 'true' red spore cube.&amp;nbsp; The fact is they were both being childish.&amp;nbsp; Red spores will appear in cubes around 1 out of 10,000 grows.&amp;nbsp; That makes it rare, but not unheard of, and certainly not a new species, whether it's coplandia or cubes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17912233</next>\n<prev>17912177</prev>\n<first>17907528</first>\n<last>17914102</last>\n<when>1362581025</when>\n<utime>03/06/13 04:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
