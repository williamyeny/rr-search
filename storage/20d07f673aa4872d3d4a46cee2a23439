One or two pieces will be needed to connect the T-junction to the power steamer outside the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Once cut, drill 1/8&quot; holes along one side of the pipes that are inside the tub. This will ensure even steam distribution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever see what happens when you pass steam through PVC?&amp;nbsp; Think about pretzels, or wet noodles.&amp;nbsp; I had a hard time reading past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use copper tubing or iron pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use a pressure cooker as a steam generator with a copper tube extending from the top to your chamber. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15378143</next>\n<prev>15377396</prev>\n<first>15369929</first>\n<last>15751774</last>\n<when>1321453827</when>\n<utime>11/16/11 04:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
