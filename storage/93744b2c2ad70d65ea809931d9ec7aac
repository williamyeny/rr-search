Those trich spores are releasing everywhere and if you let them dump they will ruin your future projects.  In my growing rooms, projects get tossed out at the very first sign of trich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll bury the contaminated cake in your garden, or even your houseplants, it will flush again this summer.  You can pick the pins off and they'll be fine to eat.  Trich isn't a human pathogen.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3975453</next>\n<prev>3975408</prev>\n<first>3975408</first>\n<last>3975453</last>\n<when>1111935542</when>\n<utime>03/27/05 04:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
