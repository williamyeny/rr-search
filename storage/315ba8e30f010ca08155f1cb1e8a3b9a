I think i've worked out most of the kinks with my basic setup &amp; maintenance, and believe my next attempt will be more productive as i hone my technique. Although just beginning, i have an extensive background in research. As i continue to refine my procedural craft, i see where i can attempt to experiment with cakes' nutritional and structural variables to potentially alter yields.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing wrong with experimenting.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to keep accurate notes, because after a while it's hard to remember what combination is in which jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We generally advise new growers not to experiment until they learn the basics, but certainly if you don't mind a high fail rate, it's an excellent way to speed up the learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15369533</next>\n<prev>15369332</prev>\n<first>15366066</first>\n<last>15369533</last>\n<when>1321304267</when>\n<utime>11/14/11 10:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
