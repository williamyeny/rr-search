Do you really belive that the spots they grow at are completely sterile? Yea right&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot; title=&quot;:rolleyes:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, horse shit is one of its favorite places. Its all warm wet and cozy, perfect for any type of bacteria and other contaminations &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild, natural outdoor growth vs indoor growth on sterile media do not compare.&amp;nbsp; If you would like to wait a year for fruits after inoculating 300 acres, just to get the same amount of product as a few small trays would provide in six weeks or less, then help yourself.&amp;nbsp; With controlled sterile indoor cultivation, we must be sterile.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10374930</next>\n<prev>10374873</prev>\n<first>10374278</first>\n<last>10374948</last>\n<when>1242914043</when>\n<utime>05/21/09 04:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
