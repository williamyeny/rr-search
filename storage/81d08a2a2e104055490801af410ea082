Some bruise so much you can see a blue fingerpint form where you touched it when you picked.  It's strain related, but by that I mean the specific genetics of the pairing that is producing the mushrooms, not the name on the print or syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't worry about that.  If the fruits are healthy, chances are they'll perform as expected.  Some people equate bluing with potency, but I've not seen the correlation.  Some of the most potent ones didn't bruise at all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6932383</prev>\n<first>6930547</first>\n<last>6932619</last>\n<when>1179465688</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 08:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
