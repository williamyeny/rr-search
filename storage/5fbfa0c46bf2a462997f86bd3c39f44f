{"key":"post-6606111","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6606111</id>\n<content>My pf jars colonize in two weeks at room temperature. (75F)  Either the heat kicked their rears, or perhaps they're too wet or something.  They should be colonized by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation is normal where colonized because the mycelium gives off heat, thus the condensation in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might try laying the jars on their sides or upside down, but that can be dangerous too because the verm barrier shifts.  Make sure any tape on the holes is removed so they can breathe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6625844</next>\n<prev>6606087</prev>\n<first>6606087</first>\n<last>6625844</last>\n<when>1172359092</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 01:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
