Ditto for pp5 containers. You also have to keep them sterile until pouring.&amp;nbsp; Keep those kinds of things in mind when deciding.&amp;nbsp; I prefer pre-sterilized plastic dishes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19202347</next>\n<prev>19201799</prev>\n<first>19200675</first>\n<last>21034278</last>\n<when>1385692004</when>\n<utime>11/29/13 04:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
