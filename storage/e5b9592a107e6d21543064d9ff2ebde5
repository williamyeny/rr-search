{"key":"post-6547107","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6547107</id>\n<content>I disagree.  This is a mushroom growing fourm, not a drug production fourm.  Extraction serves no mycological purpose when the only intention is to get high.  I'd like to lock down all those duplicate extraction threads in advanced as well.  There's nothing advanced about soaking mushrooms in alcohol(or something toxic) then drinking the brew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget extracting actives from mycelium.  There's hardly any there until fruits develop, and it's too easy to just eat mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6547292</next>\n<prev>6546029</prev>\n<first>6545698</first>\n<last>6547572</last>\n<when>1171040579</when>\n<utime>02/09/07 07:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
