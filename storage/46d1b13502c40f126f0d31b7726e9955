Looks much better than my first grow, which was a pretty shade of forest green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your pinsets will be better if you get the cakes off the perlite.  You don't want them colonizing the perlite or drawing moisture from it.  To get the best pinset, moisture must be evaporating from your substrate.  If it has a constant supply of water, your pinsets will suffer.  Dunking is great between flushes, then allow the cake to dry out a bit as it pins.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5643599</next>\n<prev>5643186</prev>\n<first>5642835</first>\n<last>5649802</last>\n<when>1147919703</when>\n<utime>05/18/06 05:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
