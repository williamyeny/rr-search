{"key":"post-5884373","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5884373</id>\n<content>Glad to see it catching on.  I just wish coir wasn't so darned expensive.  Three or four years ago when I first started recommending coir as a substrate instead of casing material, everybody thought I must have fallen off a turnip truck and bumped my head.  You can also mix it with straw to help fill in the gaps, but don't go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use it if you're growing shiitake mushrooms though.  For some reason, they refuse to fruit if coir is in the substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5884389</next>\n<prev>5884354</prev>\n<first>5883926</first>\n<last>5886171</last>\n<when>1153507815</when>\n<utime>07/21/06 09:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
