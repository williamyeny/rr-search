You can stick a pen or lighter under the corner to hold it open.  Also, drill several holes around the perimeter of the FC at or just below the level of the perlite.  These will aid in getting the CO2 out and allow fresh air in when you can't mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major cause of aborts is misting pins, then setting the lid on and leaving them wet.  Wet pins will abort in a matter of hours.  Always up the air exchange after misting until the pins either absorb the moisture from misting, or dry off.  Never mist in the primordia stage.  They're better off drying out, then getting wet.  In the primordia stage, make sure the humidity is high from the perlite, and you can mist the sides of the terrarium, but not the substrates themselves.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6213794</next>\n<prev>6213529</prev>\n<first>6213420</first>\n<last>6217222</last>\n<when>1161882318</when>\n<utime>10/26/06 08:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
