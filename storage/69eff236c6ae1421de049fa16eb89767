I get 25lbs of organic rye berries in a large city for 8 bucks.  You need to ask for 'rye berries'.  If you ask for rye seed, they'll probably give you rye grass seed, which comes from a different species.  It still works, and works well, but is a bit harder to get the moisture right.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6672255</next>\n<prev>6671757</prev>\n<first>6669106</first>\n<last>6672255</last>\n<when>1173972527</when>\n<utime>03/15/07 06:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
