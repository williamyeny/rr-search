You want humidity up around 99% to initiate pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some types of grain are terrible fruiters when simply cased.  They need to be spawned to manure or coir, so that could also be a factor.  Rye berries will fruit quite well if simply cased, but with bird seed it's hit or miss depending on what's in it.  However, if spawned into manure it will work.  I'd say that, and humidity too low are the biggest problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6848877</prev>\n<first>6848633</first>\n<last>6848937</last>\n<when>1177862654</when>\n<utime>04/29/07 07:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
