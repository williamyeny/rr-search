The holes should be on all six sides of the terrarium.  It's the circulation up from the bottom that passes through the perlite that absorbs the moisture and carries it to the terrarium.  If you skip drilling holes on the bottom, or fail to elevate the terrarium off the table so air can circulate under it, the system can't work.<br />As said, perlite will hold its humidity for six weeks to two months.  Drain it, drill holes on the bottom, get rid of the bubbler and air pump, drill holes in the lid, and most importantly, get a mechanical hygrometer and calibrate it.  Digital hygrometers are crap.<br />If your cakes have been birthed for two weeks with no pins, do a dunk and roll while you're fixing the terrarium.<br />RR"}}
