If you're growing agaricus, leave it in the refrigerator for two or three days for a good cold shock.  Cold weather edibles fruit in the fall after the cold weather sets in, which is their pinning trigger to set fruitbodies to reproduce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm weather dung and straw loving mushrooms fruit all summer, even in 95F weather, so a cold shock isn't possibly one of their pinning triggers.  They fruit in response to full colonization, a decrease in CO2 levels, with a corresponding increase in fresh air supply, a slow but steady rate of moisture loss from the substrate, and light, with the level of importance pretty much in that order.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, a mushroom that fruits in Florida in July should not be cold shocked.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6351585</next>\n<prev>6351456</prev>\n<first>6345779</first>\n<last>6351585</last>\n<when>1165705905</when>\n<utime>12/10/06 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
