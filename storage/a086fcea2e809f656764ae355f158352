They don't 'absorb' contaminants from the substrate or all wild mushrooms would be unsafe to eat.  If the mold or bacteria is on the fruit itself of course, don't eat it.

There are no health regulations against it because it's not a risk factor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6654176</next>\n<prev>6653627</prev>\n<first>6650210</first>\n<last>10518262</last>\n<when>1173491225</when>\n<utime>03/10/07 03:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
