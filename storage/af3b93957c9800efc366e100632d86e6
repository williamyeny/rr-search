You'll need several times that much air to your fruiting environment, and there is no need or reason to use polyfill or tyvek or any other filter material. Don't forget, the number 1 pinning trigger is the reduction in CO2 gasses and the introduction of massive amounts of fresh air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just drill as many holes as you can and still maintain high humidity in the fruiting chamber.  My terrariums look a lot like swiss cheese.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6562465</next>\n<prev>6562244</prev>\n<first>6562229</first>\n<last>6562465</last>\n<when>1171386464</when>\n<utime>02/13/07 07:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
