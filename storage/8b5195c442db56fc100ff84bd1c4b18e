After about 2 weeks in fruiting I started seeing a really nice pin set. I was happy with its progress but then all the caps opened with all the mushrooms only about an inch tall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a substrate management problem.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever you have a massive pinset, you have to mist and/or water the substrate enough to support them.&amp;nbsp; If not, they open the caps while very small.&amp;nbsp; It sounds like you trashed an awesome strain.&amp;nbsp;  Furthermore, small mushrooms are more potent by weight than large ones so they're what you want for eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, don't isolate one strain.&amp;nbsp; Isolate a dozen or more and test each one.&amp;nbsp; Test with brf cakes so it's faster and you don't waste a lot of time or money on the bad strains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19278070</next>\n<prev>19278043</prev>\n<first>19278043</first>\n<last>19278493</last>\n<when>1387118011</when>\n<utime>12/15/13 04:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
