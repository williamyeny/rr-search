Find a way to elevate them so only steam touches the jars.  Begin counting time when the PSI reaches ten pounds.  At the end of 1 hour, shut off the stove, and let it sit for several hours until the pressure slowly drops, and the unit returns to near room temp.  Don't do anything to speed up this process.<br />Be sure to let steam vent for a few minutes before putting the weight on at the start of the cycle.<br />RR"}}
