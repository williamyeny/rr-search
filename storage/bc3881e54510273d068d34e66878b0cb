This is all piped into A stripped Refrigerator for an FC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this.&amp;nbsp; If you're seeing a fog, it means you've already reached 100% humidity and are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; piping in moisture, which will saturate your substrate and prevent the loss of moisture that is such a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; You don't want to see a fog.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to try reducing humidity in the refrigerator to &amp;lt;95%, and lay a sheet of wax paper over the substrates until pins form.&amp;nbsp; Lift the paper regularly to fan out under it and replace when it gets soggy.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to wrinkle up the paper and then flatten it back out again so air can penetrate underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a closed environment such as the fridge you're using, a single cool mist running four to five minutes on the hour should supply more than enough humidity without the ultrasonic running at all.&amp;nbsp; In fact a few trays of perlite should do the trick.&amp;nbsp; Leave the door propped partly open for fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13551508</next>\n<prev>13523184</prev>\n<first>13522899</first>\n<last>13580724</last>\n<when>1290441409</when>\n<utime>11/22/10 05:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
