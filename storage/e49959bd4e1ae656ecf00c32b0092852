You can simply pluck the pins and place them right on the agar.  Within a couple of days, mycelium will be growing out well away from the fruits and any contaminants that were on them, will be left behind.  Take a small pieces of mycelium from the leading edge after four or five days, and transfer them to a new petri dishes.  Result-clean mycelium with little sterile technique involved other than when you pour the agar.<br />It's important if using this cloning tek to use rapidly growing pins so that the mycelium will outrun any contaminants.  It won't work well with old, or slow growing fruits.  The pictures below were only taken a few days apart.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597204-Cloning_pins_1.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597204-thumb_Cloning_pins_1.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-22/926597212-Cloning_pins_2.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/06-22/926597212-thumb_Cloning_pins_2.jpg\"></a>"}}
