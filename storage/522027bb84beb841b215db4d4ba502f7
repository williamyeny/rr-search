As long as a large portion on the tote is clear to let light it, it should be good to use. I would rather by a clear tub with a solid colored lid, then mess around with cutting a hole and replacing it with plexiglass. .</blockquote><br />This is correct.<br />There's some very bad advice in this thread.&nbsp; Light is an important pinning trigger, and if you're using a colored terrarium with a clear lid, you've just blocked out 80% of the light.&nbsp; More light enters a terrarium from the sides than top.&nbsp; Best is a clear tub with a clear lid.&nbsp; Second best is a clear tub with a white lid so the lid reflects light down.&nbsp; Don't use opaque tubs.&nbsp; Members who do often post asking why they have such crappy pinsets and small, undeveloped fruits with tiny caps.<br />RR"}}
