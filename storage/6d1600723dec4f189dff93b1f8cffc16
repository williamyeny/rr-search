I mixed it into my compost pile and forgot all about it until the fall rains came when I found hundreds of cubes all around the base of the compost pile.  I've been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually took me well over a year to learn that mushrooms don't have roots.  There were no books on cultivation at the time, and of course no internet. The Dallas, Texas public library was my only source of information. I finally found Alexander Smith's field guide to western mushrooms in the mid 70's, and learned a lot about mushrooms from that, even though it's not a cultivation book.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7604556</next>\n<prev>7604130</prev>\n<first>7601696</first>\n<last>7606444</last>\n<when>1194402046</when>\n<utime>11/07/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
