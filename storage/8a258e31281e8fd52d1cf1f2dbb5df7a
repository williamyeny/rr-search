Of course mycelium needs good food too, but you can't compare multispore inoculated grows from substrate to substrate.  There is FAR more variations in the eventual strains produced from multispore inoculation then there is from the minor differences in substrate choice.  This comes from doing thousands of grows over the years, not a wild guess, and I don't use multispore inoculation.  I used single sector isolated strains with proved genetics, growth characteristics and potency.  It varies little from subtrate to substrate, but the various strains vary considerably, regardless of substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is makes little difference if you feed your dog turnip greens, red meat or Iams, he won't win the iditarod without good genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish this same thing wouldn't have to get repeated week after week. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6788772</next>\n<prev>6787133</prev>\n<first>6786274</first>\n<last>6788772</last>\n<when>1176581252</when>\n<utime>04/14/07 11:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
