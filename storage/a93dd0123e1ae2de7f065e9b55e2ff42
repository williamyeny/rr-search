All during that time, my flowhood has been running to capture as many of the spores as possible. I won't grow again until I get my mushroom cave built, and it looks like I'll need to wear a respirator whenever I enter it. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/frown.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:frown:&quot; title=&quot;:frown:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10229058</next>\n<prev>10228976</prev>\n<first>10228623</first>\n<last>10229390</last>\n<when>1240633569</when>\n<utime>04/25/09 07:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
