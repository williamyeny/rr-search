I shouldn't have to waste shrooms to get where I want to be, I simply want to solve the problem and not be lazy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to learn to isolate strains.&amp;nbsp; Growing from spores results in several strains active on the same substrate.&amp;nbsp; Not all strains are going to have the qualities you desire.&amp;nbsp; If they're getting proper lighting and developing correctly, then wysiwyg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolate and save the best strains, so that next time every mushroom will have those qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the best of strains, I'll eat ten or more dry grams.&amp;nbsp; Crap, I'll eat ten dry grams of &lt;i&gt;P cyanescens&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I'm pretty sure what one person considers a level 4 or 5 experience isn't what the next person would.
