The RH was no lower than 75%, with it around 85% most of the time with constant misting of the casing layer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A casing shouldn't be more than 1/2&quot; thick unless you're using a six inch or more substrate depth, which doesn't work well with cubensis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you want 95% humidity, not 85%.  Fruit size is mostly related to moisture content of the substrate, provided it doesn't waterlog.  constant misting of the casing layer is not advised.  It needs to be misted well, and then allowed to partially dry out before misting again.  There needs to be evaporation of moisture from the casing layer for the mycelium to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7643949</next>\n<prev>7643345</prev>\n<first>7642336</first>\n<last>7645048</last>\n<when>1195231968</when>\n<utime>11/16/07 06:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
