They're too thin and will tear easily when it comes time to shake to distribute the mycelium.  In addition, by the time you go to the effort and expense of making a proper filter, you'll have spent nearly as much as the proper bags cost, which is about 40 cents if you'll order 100 at a time.   Order filter patch bags from a mycology supplier.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6775277</next>\n<prev>6774438</prev>\n<first>6772676</first>\n<last>6775277</last>\n<when>1176308306</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 07:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
