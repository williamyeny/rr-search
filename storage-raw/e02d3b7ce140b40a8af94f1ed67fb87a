{"key":"post-5482707","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5482707</id>\n<content>'Room Temperature' in the way I use it means 72f - 74F.  If you need to wear a sweater indoors, then your house is not being kept at 'room temperature'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest reason I recommend room temperature to newbies is because of all the horror stories of incubators getting too hot and ruining projects.   I don't think anyone will argue that a jar will colonize faster at 80f than at 65F to 70F.  The distinction to make is, &quot;is it worth the expense and risk to colonize my jars a few days earlier&quot; or just let them go on their own at room temp.  I practice and recommend the latter.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I practice room temp colonization is that I have anywhere from 100 to 200 jars of various species colonizing at any given time, and having them on a series of open shelves allows me to quickly see the progress they're making.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are considerable factors that influence pinning.  Personally, my own experience does not show a temperature drop to be one of them.  I have fruited at a lower temperature than colonization, and I've fruited at the same temperature as colonization, with absolutely no difference in pinset whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I had an experiment that I wanted to speed up, so an extra space heater was placed into the room, raising the temps to 82F for a few weeks.  The greenhouse was in this same room and also subjectd to the increased temperatures.   Projects that had incubated at 75F were placed into the greenhouse which was now at 84F due to the slight heating effects of the lighting.  I saw absolutely no difference in pinset when an INcrease of nearly ten degrees was given upon introduction to fruiting conditions.  I believe the other, known factors that influence pinning are far more critical than temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional reason for incubating at room temperature is that many bacterial contaminants and molds are encouraged by higher temperatures, which can make even a short lived increase in the desired temperature possibly fatal to the mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize my experiences, mycelium will colonize a substrate faster at 82 to 84 than it will at room temperature(72-74). Nobody disputes that fact.  Each grower has to decide if that extra few days if worth the expense and risk of building an incubator that may or may not perform as expected while he is away at work for ten or more hours each day.   Jars sitting on an open shelf are not going to overheat, nor will there be a heated box to catch on fire when left unattended all day.  I hope this has helped.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5483390</next>\n<prev>5482229</prev>\n<first>5479871</first>\n<last>13239270</last>\n<when>1144261683</when>\n<utime>04/05/06 09:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
