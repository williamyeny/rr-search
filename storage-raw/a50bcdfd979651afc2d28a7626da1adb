{"key":"post-5736073","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5736073</id>\n<content>Looks like stress from the cake sitting on the perlite.  Never set the cakes directly on perlite.  The cake gets soggy, and so do the fruits.  If your cake is too wet and not losing moisture during cropping, you'll get a crappy pinset.  Bummer.  Next time, set the cake on a jar lid or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar pictures are too blurry and dark to see anything.  Can't help ya there.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5736103</next>\n<prev>5735916</prev>\n<first>5735916</first>\n<last>5742490</last>\n<when>1150001047</when>\n<utime>06/11/06 07:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
