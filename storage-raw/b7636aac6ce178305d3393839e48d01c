I lost the tek i was using but it was something like 1 1/4 cup of rye berries to a quart jar (cleaned)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Then to add water till an 1/8 of an inch is just above the rye. close jars up and get them ready for the pc. Well, the tek said to pc at 15psi for 1 hr and 10 minutes. exactly what i did..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the method we used 20 years ago when we didn't know any better, and it failed at least 25% of the time.&amp;nbsp; Today, there's FAR better ways to ensure success with grains.&amp;nbsp; My tek is posted above or you can see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;video of it along with some text&lt;/a&gt; on my website.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9676230</next>\n<prev>9674766</prev>\n<first>9674480</first>\n<last>15006919</last>\n<when>1232905831</when>\n<utime>01/25/09 07:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
