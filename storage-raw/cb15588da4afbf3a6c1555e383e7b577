If the question has already been answered, I move on. The forum guidelines state that posts bumped within 48 hours are to be closed.&amp;nbsp; I've been cutting slack, but that's the rule.&amp;nbsp; You're not the first to get that mentioned to.&amp;nbsp; The forum is getting really busy, so you guys have to wait.&amp;nbsp; There's not as many who can answer agar questions, so it takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your problem was using hot water to mix the agar.&amp;nbsp; Always mix the dry ingredients first, then add a small amount of room temperature water and swirl it around until the powder is dissolved.&amp;nbsp; Don't shake, just swirl.&amp;nbsp; Then add the rest of the water and sterilize.&amp;nbsp; Pour the dishes before the agar cools below 100F or it will begin to solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an awesome day, btw. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:wink:&quot; title=&quot;:wink:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6643952</next>\n<prev>6643939</prev>\n<first>6643216</first>\n<last>6643952</last>\n<when>1173254798</when>\n<utime>03/07/07 10:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
