You might see something if you put the dish under a microscope, but it takes a few days after germination for them to thicken up enough to see with the naked eye.  2 tsp is pretty close to the right amount of agar agar to use with 500ml.  As long as it thickened up it's fine.  Sometimes I use half the amount of agar so it's soupy for germinating spores, but it really isn't necessary if the spores were fresh or from a syringe.  I use wet agar when germinating right from the print, using an inoculating loop.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6956012</next>\n<prev>6955930</prev>\n<first>6953965</first>\n<last>6956012</last>\n<when>1179935455</when>\n<utime>05/23/07 06:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
