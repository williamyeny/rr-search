{"key":"post-6640716","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6640716</id>\n<content>I get 90% to 95% with cool mists alone.  I have never used an ultrasonic because I've found them not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never seal a fruiting chamber or greenhouse up tight.  You want massive amounts of air exchange to stimulate pinning and to prevent contaminants which thrive in stale, still, moist air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several 4&quot; holes cut in the sides of my greenhouse, and the door is a simple piece of plastic sheeting that hangs from the ceiling all the way to the floor and is not attached at all except at the top.  This leaves two slits the full vertical length of the greenhouse.  All of the above provides plenty of air exchange, and an impeller type cool mist &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;inside the greenhouse&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;provides the humidity by only running one to two minutes on, five to seven minutes off.  I tweak the cycle timer depending on how full of substrate trays it is at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps to get a bunch of plastic trays and fill each one with damp perlite.  Use these to line the floor to catch drips, and also to fill up any empty shelf space within the greenhouse.  Doing the above will provide you with 90% to 95% humidity along with ample air exchange.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also do a search, and you'll find all of this has been covered many, many times before with experienced growers using all sorts of methods.  This is my method, but by no means is it the only one that will work.  Other growers prefer to put the cool mist outside the greenhouse, then modify it to pipe the humidity in, but that isn't my personal choice for reasons I've previously posted, but it certainly works and they have the pictures to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6640773</next>\n<prev>6640411</prev>\n<first>6639775</first>\n<last>6644639</last>\n<when>1173196482</when>\n<utime>03/06/07 05:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
