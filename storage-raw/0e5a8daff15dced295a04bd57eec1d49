I have some three to four year old master slants that I'll probably get out next year to see how they're doing.&amp;nbsp; I've lost quite a few species after two years on slants, but having wood in the slant extends that time somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I try to make it a point to get my important cultures out once yearly to place on a petri dish, let grow for a week, and then inoculate fresh slants.&amp;nbsp; The old ones can stay in storage, but it's good to always have fresh backups.&amp;nbsp; When I get ready to grow, I look for the oldest date on a slant in storage, which will contain the youngest cell lines.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10729049</prev>\n<first>10727081</first>\n<last>10729306</last>\n<when>1248402546</when>\n<utime>07/24/09 05:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
