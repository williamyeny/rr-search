When pesticides are used routinely, the insects soon grow immune to them.  I'm wondering if there's any chance that using peroxide as a matter of routine as opposed to as needed is going to select for resistance in bacteria and molds.  After all, only the trich spores or cobweb that are tolerant of the peroxide are going to germinate, and then reproduce. This is the reason I personally only use peroxide to kill an active cobweb infestion, and of course it's good to dip cloned material in peroxide before placing on agar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that using peroxide to kill bacteria on a casing is counterproductive.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5716510</next>\n<prev>5716295</prev>\n<first>5713840</first>\n<last>5722301</last>\n<when>1149560154</when>\n<utime>06/06/06 05:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
