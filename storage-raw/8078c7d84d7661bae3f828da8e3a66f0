That is probably as close to actual proof as we're going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that if the aluminum is being metabolized to the point of eating holes in the tray after just a couple of weeks, the possiblilty there is aluminum in the fruits should not be discounted.  Aluminum in the body has been implicated in Alzhimers. I used to use the aluminum bread pans, but stopped when I learned the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen trays rot worse than the one above after just one flush.  I'd post pics but I've thrown them all away.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5609787</next>\n<prev>5608912</prev>\n<first>5607764</first>\n<last>5865568</last>\n<when>1147205243</when>\n<utime>05/09/06 11:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
