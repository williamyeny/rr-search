I've seen bulk substrates produce 20F above ambient temperature. You need to colonize small substrates at normal room temperature, and large substrates should be colonized at slightly below normal room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12715542</prev>\n<first>12685150</first>\n<last>12715673</last>\n<when>1276119470</when>\n<utime>06/10/10 12:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
