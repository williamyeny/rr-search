People normaly use hydrated lime to cover oders, its not reccomended for neutralizing acidity. It just depends on how your using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Hydrated lime is the best product we have for increasing pH, should a grower need to do this.&amp;nbsp; Lime or calcium carbonate take much longer to break down in a casing layer, thus they don't go to work until it's nearly time to throw the project out anyway.&amp;nbsp; If one is making casing layers for some reason, hydrated lime is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do explain how hydrated lime can burn the hell out of you.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, one doesn't make a line on the mirror and snort it, but I've had it all over me many times with absolutely no burning or other bad effects.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I often make my own concrete with portland cement, hydrated lime, and gravel from my own property.&amp;nbsp; I've probably had my hands into a few thousand pounds of hydrated lime over the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13335216</next>\n<prev>13334968</prev>\n<first>13334377</first>\n<last>13342585</last>\n<when>1287072369</when>\n<utime>10/14/10 07:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
