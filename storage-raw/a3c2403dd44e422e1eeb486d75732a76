You can actually hang it inside the terrarium to create turbulence and constant movement, but if you do this, be sure to use a 12 volt or lower fan, not a line voltage one which would be dangerous at high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've found with enough holes drilled into a tub, a fan isn't necessary.  Below is a picture of how I make mine.  Four inches of damp perlite in the bottom maintains 95%, even with all those holes on all six sides.  the poor seal around the lid also helps and adds to the fresh air exchange.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/287245516-Terrarium_2a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-009/287245516-thumb_Terrarium_2a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6637940</prev>\n<first>6637632</first>\n<last>6638414</last>\n<when>1173139317</when>\n<utime>03/06/07 02:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
