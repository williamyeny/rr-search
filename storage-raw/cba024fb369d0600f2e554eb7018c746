Temperature drop is not a pinning trigger with tropical species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expose to light from the time you put the casing layer on, if not before.&amp;nbsp; In fact, there's no reason at all to colonize in darkness, which delays the eventual pinset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh air is the number 1 pinning trigger because it causes an evaporation of moisture from the substrate.&amp;nbsp; Three air exchanges per day is not enough.&amp;nbsp; Four per hour is recommended.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest drilling a lot more holes in your terrarium to get the air moving in there.&amp;nbsp; In fact, you could take the lid completely off and use wax paper to hold a high humidity right at the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want bright, high frequency light.&amp;nbsp; 6500 Kelvin which you'll get from fluorescent tubes labeled 'natural daylight' is about perfect, or a bright window will do as well.&amp;nbsp; A few minutes of direct sunlight each day will often trigger a stubborn project into fruiting as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10853820</next>\n<prev>10853570</prev>\n<first>10852756</first>\n<last>11103699</last>\n<when>1250198707</when>\n<utime>08/14/09 12:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
