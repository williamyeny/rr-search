To get the larger pieces you need for fruiting, simply use your band or table saw to cut it into 1/2&quot; slices.  To fill the gaps between the larger pieces where the fruits will form, use course(NOT fine) sawdust.  I'd suggest supplimenting it with wheat or rice bran prior to sterilization. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7566567</next>\n<prev>7566361</prev>\n<first>7566325</first>\n<last>7566591</last>\n<when>1193503909</when>\n<utime>10/27/07 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
