When you pay with credit or debit it is documented who you paid your money too and what you bought with that money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; This is most definitely a legitimate concern for some people..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stores that sell money orders have security cameras and the money orders are numbered.&amp;nbsp; Any law enforcement agency that desires can trace the money order back to the store and there's your smiling face on camera.&amp;nbsp; It ain't more secure. . .sorry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12279352</next>\n<prev>12279251</prev>\n<first>12267685</first>\n<last>12378622</last>\n<when>1269657417</when>\n<utime>03/27/10 05:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
