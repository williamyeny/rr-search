It takes time to heat the grains all the way to the middle, so by the time they get close to full temperature in the middle of the jar, you'll be shutting off the stove. . .twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason a PC with 1&quot; of water should run dry in less than three hours if you're using it properly.  There's no need for the weight to even rattle.  Once pressure is reached, turn down the heat to the very minimum setting that will maintain pressure.  The only reason the instructions say to 'let it rattle a few times a minute' is so couch potatoes can watch TV and not pay attention to the cooker except for the occasional listen from the other room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most PC's will hiss slightly before the weight actually rattles.  If you adjust your stove burner to maintain this sweet spot, you'll have around 14 PSI in your cooker, and it will run for several hours on 1&quot; of water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6722678</next>\n<prev>6722333</prev>\n<first>6718344</first>\n<last>6730507</last>\n<when>1175143262</when>\n<utime>03/29/07 07:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
