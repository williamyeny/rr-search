If so, 12 volts at 500ma means you need a six watt resistor, but if you're using 11 K ohms, it sounds like you're trying to control an AC fan by reducing current, which doesn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's a DC fan, try getting a power supply of lower voltage.  A rheostat of the correct watt rating would be large and expensive.  If it's an AC fan, get a motor speed controller. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/accessory/controls2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.littlegreenhouse.com/&lt;wbr&gt;accessory/controls2.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7980100</next>\n<prev>7979954</prev>\n<first>7979783</first>\n<last>7985385</last>\n<when>1202184337</when>\n<utime>02/05/08 06:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
