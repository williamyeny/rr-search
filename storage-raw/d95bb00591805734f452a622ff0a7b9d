{"key":"post-11571785","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>11571785</id>\n<content>It's confusing to new growers because for years, people around here didn't know the correct nomenclature, thus they referred to their projects incorrectly as 'casings'.&amp;nbsp; They call manure 'poo', metabolites 'piss', and dozens of other incorrect terms from junior high school, polluting the FAQ and grow guides to the point they should really all be deleted and started over from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're growing &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt;, you should pasteurize your casing layers if used, and bulk substrate ingredients.&amp;nbsp; Verm-coir makes an excellent bulk substrate, and as said already, requires no casing or pH buffer.&amp;nbsp; This is the substrate I'd recommend for you now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use tap, spring, or even lake or pond water, but not distilled water for grains and bulk substrates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11571955</next>\n<prev>11571506</prev>\n<first>11571221</first>\n<last>11574087</last>\n<when>1259804347</when>\n<utime>12/03/09 03:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
