Our sponsors pay the bills, which keeps the forum free for everybody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the grow guide you referenced said to use the oven for inoculations, then it is horrible.  The oven tek was discredited years ago as being 100% bogus.  The turbulent air created by a warm oven actually increases contamination rates drastically over regular open air, which also should not be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll find the information you need right here, and our vendors are carefully screened to make sure their product and information is accurate.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7546968</next>\n<prev>7546855</prev>\n<first>7546348</first>\n<last>7547638</last>\n<when>1193081637</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 10:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
