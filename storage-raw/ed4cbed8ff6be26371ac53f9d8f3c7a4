When they fully colonize, use them to spawn to the horse manure in a tray.  Make the substrate about 1 1/2&quot; thick at most.  Pans for some reason don't perform as well from a thick substrate.  When that fully colonizes, use 1/4&quot; of peat-verm for a casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6658478</next>\n<prev>6658317</prev>\n<first>6658317</first>\n<last>6659906</last>\n<when>1173641096</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 10:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
