{"key":"post-7965862","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7965862</id>\n<content>I recommend against liming substrates.  You would optimally have a pH around 6 to get nice rapid colonization.  If you go a bit over temp on pasteurization, it won't hurt much.  If the manure ends up getting sterilized, it will be slightly more prone to contamination unless you use a high spawn rate to achieve fast colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt the lime hurt, and 6.7 is still great.  When you make the casing layer in a week or two, adjust to pH 8 to 8.5 at the start.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7965994</next>\n<prev>7965849</prev>\n<first>7965639</first>\n<last>7965994</last>\n<when>1201912228</when>\n<utime>02/02/08 02:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
