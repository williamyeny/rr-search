You'll want to air it out more often with oysters, as they're extremely CO2 intolerant.  If the CO2 is high, they'll have a baseball bat look to them, as yours are starting to get.  If light is not bright enough, they'll develop into a coral type formation.  Find that happy spot, and they'll get nice and meaty.  Colder fruiting temps take a bit longer, but you get a thicker, meatier fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd go ahead and open it up to the air, and use misting if necessary to make up for the lost moisture.  Oysters love to be misted, so don't stress that it's going to abort or anything.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7827999</next>\n<prev>7827663</prev>\n<first>7827291</first>\n<last>7835522</last>\n<when>1199395506</when>\n<utime>01/03/08 11:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
