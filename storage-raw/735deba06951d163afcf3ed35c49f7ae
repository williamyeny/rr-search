{"key":"post-6433043","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6433043</id>\n<content>For a 107 quart tub, I'd go with at least six 1/2&quot; holes.  Do another row at the top.  You don't need polyfill to stop contaminants in a fruiting chamber.  I have several 4&quot; holes cut into my mini greenhouse, including a 4&quot; dryer hose connecting it to the outside air.  Remember, you want circulation and turbulence in a fruiting chamber.  Don't worry about contaminant spores getting on your project.  Just make the environment inhospitable to them and you'll be fine.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6433610</next>\n<prev>6432999</prev>\n<first>6432547</first>\n<last>6433808</last>\n<when>1168148540</when>\n<utime>01/07/07 07:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
