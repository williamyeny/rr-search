As this happens, the pressure causes excess gas to leave the jars.&amp;nbsp; When the jars are cooling,the volume per gas molecules ratio are much smaller than before from gas escaping from heat causing the pressure to pull inward on the glass.&amp;nbsp; If you dont make the lids loose, the pressure causes the glass to crack.&amp;nbsp; So like I said before, close them all the way and open a quarter turn to ensure that they are loose enough without falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bad advice.&amp;nbsp; Tighten the lids all the way.&amp;nbsp; Glass jars are designed to hold a vacuum without breaking as this is how they preserve canned food. However, since you have holes in the lids for inoculation/gas exchange, there won't be any vacuum pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, we're not filling the jar up with liquid the way it's done when canning peaches.&amp;nbsp; We're using a moist but not wet substrate and there's nothing to boil over, so to maintain sterility we tighten the lids until snug.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18414820</next>\n<prev>18414693</prev>\n<first>18411569</first>\n<last>18415942</last>\n<when>1371164982</when>\n<utime>06/14/13 02:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
