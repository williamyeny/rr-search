You can't replace it with more fertilizer, because mushrooms are not plants that uptake water and nutrients to create energy in the leaves.   Mushroom mycelium, which lives in the soil, eats its food, therefore after a few flushes, the food is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a straw and dung loving species, you can bury the spent substrate into some horse or cow manure in a shady spot outdoors.  Keep it slightly moist, and in a month or two, you'll probably see a nice flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a wood decomposing species, do the above, but with hardwood chips and sawdust.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7233076</next>\n<prev>7227440</prev>\n<first>7221143</first>\n<last>7233115</last>\n<when>1185499628</when>\n<utime>07/27/07 04:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
