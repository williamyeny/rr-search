I'd put them in the dark when they're about 90% colonized, then when they are at 100%, birth and begin giving them light at that time.  This allows the four major pinning triggers of full colonization, steady rate of evaporation from the substrate, fresh air exchange, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; light to all happen at the same time.  Such has been shown to give the best pinsets.  Light does not become a significant pinning trigger until the other factors have also been met.  Many growers dunk at the time of birthing to pump the moisture content up for the first flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5978476</next>\n<prev>5978416</prev>\n<first>5978112</first>\n<last>5979046</last>\n<when>1156015583</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 10:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
