After you birth the cakes, do a 'dunk and roll', but don't put them directly on the perlite.  You want well drained perlite for your terrarium, so drill some holes in the bottom of the tub to let any excess water out, and also to allow air to enter, which will then flow up through the perlite, wicking moisture as it goes.  You can read the theory of operation on my terrariums here: &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6880451#Post6880451&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/6880451#Post6&lt;wbr&gt;880451&lt;/a&gt; and you can watch a pf tek video that explains terrarium building on YouTube here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=5E89E9D16348D911&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/view_play&lt;wbr&gt;_list?p=5E89E9D16348D911&lt;/a&gt;   It's in four parts, so be sure to watch all four parts.  I think the terrarium tek is in part 3.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6945339</next>\n<prev>6945246</prev>\n<first>6945246</first>\n<last>6945535</last>\n<when>1179728761</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 09:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
