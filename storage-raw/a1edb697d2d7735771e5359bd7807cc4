{"key":"post-6542934","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6542934</id>\n<content>The problem with stickies seems to be that if there's more than one or two, nobody sees them and starts a new thread anyway.  We're seeing that with endless worthless strain questions, even though we have a sticky at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's already a marketplace forum and this isn't the place to post things for sale anyway, but rather for cultivation teks and questions only.  I don't believe making a supply thread sticky in here is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6542975</next>\n<prev>6542410</prev>\n<first>6539949</first>\n<last>6543415</last>\n<when>1170920441</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 09:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
