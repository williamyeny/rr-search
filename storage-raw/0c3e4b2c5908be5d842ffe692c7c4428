But I don't drink so this seems like the most worth while way to use this Everclear 190 proof I have sitting around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe you've interpreted previous work incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent cakes are &lt;i&gt;spent as far as using as spawn.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; The mycelium has already fruited and it's time to die a natural death.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium doesn't produce actives in noticeable amounts until fruiting, so it's likely you'd still be able to extract some psilocybin from the cakes.&amp;nbsp; However, since psilocybin is water soluble you could as easily extract it in water as in expensive everclear, or at least that's the results of the tests I ran several years ago trying to duplicate pf's claims.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15477569</next>\n<prev>15473045</prev>\n<first>15453078</first>\n<last>15490096</last>\n<when>1323185906</when>\n<utime>12/06/11 05:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
