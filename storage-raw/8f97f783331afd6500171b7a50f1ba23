Light for growing mushrooms is a lot different than light growing marijuana. Marijuana needs light for photosynthesis. The light for mushrooms only tells them which direction to grow in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is absolutely incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a few milliseconds of light will not trigger pinning.&amp;nbsp; The fact is, cubensis will pin in total darkness, and that's probably what confused the guys who gave Paul that information.&amp;nbsp; However, the pinset will be poor and the fruits misshaped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to another facet of disinformation being passed around here, mycelium/mushrooms DO get energy from light.&amp;nbsp; Many people think because mycelium doesn't conduct photosynthesis, that light is only for knowing 'which way is up', which is also incorrect.&amp;nbsp; The force of gravity is what tells the mushrooms which way is 'up'.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grow towards the light because they're deriving energy from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms grown in bright, high frequency light will be meatier, have fatter caps, and thicker heavier stems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10708559</next>\n<prev>10708260</prev>\n<first>10703595</first>\n<last>10709638</last>\n<when>1248103660</when>\n<utime>07/20/09 06:27 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
