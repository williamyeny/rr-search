Wet grains will slow down the mycelium, and then surviving bacteria as a chance to take over.&amp;nbsp; The key is fast colonization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are killed off easily.&amp;nbsp; Bacterial endospores can survive many hours in the PC.&amp;nbsp; Bacteria contamination is caused by surviving endospores, or poor sterile procedure during inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PC for 90 minutes and follow strict sterile procedure.&amp;nbsp; Probably the majority of bacterial 'wet spot' contamination comes from the breath of the cultivator, so flame your needles, etc., and use a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10340799</next>\n<prev>10340744</prev>\n<first>10339656</first>\n<last>10340994</last>\n<when>1242362462</when>\n<utime>05/15/09 07:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
