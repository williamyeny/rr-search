{"key":"post-3901993","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3901993</id>\n<content>For the record, I incubate ALL jars, whether rye, popcorn, etc., at room temperature.  I see no reason for building an incubator in the first place.  If the room is comfortable for you to sit in with a t-shirt on, it's warm enough for your mushroom mycelium.  Remember, trich and cobweb are favored at higher temps.  Mushroom myc will do very well at 70F.  The jars may colonize a day or two earlier if you elevate the temp, but contams will also thrive at the higher temperature.  Just put your jars on a bookshelf and let normal room temperature do its thing.  No reason to keep them in the dark either.  That's another myth we need to dispell.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3902019</next>\n<prev>3901907</prev>\n<first>3899492</first>\n<last>3905653</last>\n<when>1110561972</when>\n<utime>03/11/05 07:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
