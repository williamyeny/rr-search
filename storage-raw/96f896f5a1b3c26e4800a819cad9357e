You want to use hydrated lime or calcium carbonate for pH adjustment.  However, hydrated lime is water soluable so it balances the pH right away.  Calcium carbonate is a long term buffer that is better suited to gardens, since mushroom casing layers are not used long term.  Search my posts and hydrated lime for a good starting point on how much to use.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7546667</next>\n<prev>7546623</prev>\n<first>7546584</first>\n<last>7547595</last>\n<when>1193076935</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 09:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
