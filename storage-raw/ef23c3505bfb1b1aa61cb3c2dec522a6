After the dunk, wash under the faucet with running  cold water, then while soaking wet, drop into a bowl of dry verm and roll the cake around until every surface is coated with as thick a coat as you can get to stick.  Then, place in the fruiting chamber and mist lightly several times over the next hour or two to completely soak the verm, making sure you don't get it so wet it washes off, but getting it saturated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's a new package of verm, you could get away with not treating it, but probably to be on the safe side you should.  Spreading it on a cookie sheet and sticking in a 350F oven for an hour will make certain there's no mold or bacteria on it.  However, there's nothing sterile about FC's so that's probably overkill, but I usually do it unless I'm taking the verm out of a freshly opened bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll see the full dunk and roll tek on my DVD.  It's part of the brf tek section on disk 1.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6858750</next>\n<prev>6858597</prev>\n<first>6851473</first>\n<last>6858910</last>\n<when>1178053102</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 11:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
