I always make mine on the dry side because I only use the grains as spawn to bulk substrates.  Grains prepared a bit dry will colonize much faster than if they're too wet.  I use the rule of thumb that the grains should be twice their original dry size, but no larger.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6147153</next>\n<prev>6146401</prev>\n<first>6141570</first>\n<last>6147153</last>\n<when>1160333751</when>\n<utime>10/08/06 09:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
