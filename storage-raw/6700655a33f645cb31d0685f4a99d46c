Obviously shroom spores have to germinate in more than one way to be able to compete out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look man, Im putting on my tin foil hat for this one.&amp;nbsp; Post a link to some evidence that this even remotely possible.&amp;nbsp; Id love to read it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best cinch the foil down nice and tight because that's how it happens.&amp;nbsp; Cows(not horses) eat the spore covered grass next to growing mushrooms and repeat the process.&amp;nbsp; Many, many wild patches have been initiated by inserting spore prints into a cattle water trough.&amp;nbsp; Don't deny or ridicule that which you don't understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing happens in the plant kingdom with many birds and mammals eating seeds and then depositing them in their dung elsewhere to sprout and grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14398725</next>\n<prev>14398635</prev>\n<first>14396896</first>\n<last>14401235</last>\n<when>1304515370</when>\n<utime>05/04/11 04:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
