It's probably penicillium, which is what the blue chunks in blue cheese salad dressing are.  You can eat it if you can stand the taste.  It's not toxic.  Personally, I never open a bag of bread when I see mold inside.  I don't want to release the millions of spores that would escape into my house by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7909844</next>\n<prev>7909270</prev>\n<first>7908976</first>\n<last>7958952</last>\n<when>1200949728</when>\n<utime>01/21/08 11:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
