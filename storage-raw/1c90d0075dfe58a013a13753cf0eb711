They'll grow towards it. It's what I've gathered from RR's explanations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things that make them fruit are:&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Air&lt;br /&gt;Lower Humidity (only slightly)&lt;br /&gt;Temperature drop (only slightly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is only so they &quot;know&quot; which way is up. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:smile:&quot; title=&quot;:smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn't get any of that from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light needs to be very bright for best production.&amp;nbsp; Air currents and the force of gravity actually have a lot more to do with which direction they grow than light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temp drop is not a pinning trigger with tropical species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use a black tub for a fruiting chamber.&amp;nbsp; Performance will be mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the section on lighting at the bottom of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;terrarium tek page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10434509</next>\n<prev>10434310</prev>\n<first>10421938</first>\n<last>10442818</last>\n<when>1243872767</when>\n<utime>06/01/09 07:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
