In addition, I strongly suspect it was the opening of the substrate to fresh air that triggered the primordia formation, not the light.  However, light at the higher end of the spectrum such as natural daylight fluorescent does indeed stimulate a better pinset than light at the lower end such as incandescent.  'Grow lights' are usually at the low end, intended for fruiting plants, which want a 'redder' light.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6974042</next>\n<prev>6954666</prev>\n<first>6954064</first>\n<last>6974286</last>\n<when>1179899278</when>\n<utime>05/23/07 08:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
