{"key":"post-1475175","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>1475175</id>\n<content>Let the veil tear.  That is a myth that needs to be put to rest once and for all.  I like to pick before the spores drop though, cause it makes such a mess.  You can usually get 20% or more growth between veil tear and spore drop, although it's usually just a matter of a few hours.  Straw will yeild 80% of the fruit on the first flush.  It will flush again, but your growing space would be better utilized with a fresh project.  Hope this helps. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1477789</next>\n<prev>1475004</prev>\n<first>1474850</first>\n<last>1477789</last>\n<when>1050818274</when>\n<utime>04/20/03 08:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
