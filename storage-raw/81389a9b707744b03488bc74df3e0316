Teaching my girlfriend anything is a chore compared to teaching anyone else. I have even been told by others that I have a lot of patients and explain things in great detail. Even been told I should be a teaching! But for some reason my one girlfriend just does not learn very easy. At all. Its so hard but I love her for other reasons. My other girlfriend makes up for what she lacks and vice versa. Someday I will teach her how to grow. She would make a great assistance since we are both on the same wave length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think spousal units just don't want to listen to their mates. They confuse 'instruction' with 'bossing them around'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the 1990's I had a flight instruction business, teaching people to fly tailwheel equipped aircraft, with a fleet of classic planes from the 1940s.&amp;nbsp; There was another flight instructor on the field who had been trying to teach his wife to fly for years and she just didn't get it.&amp;nbsp; I had been trying to teach my wife(not the current she-rabbit) to fly too, without success.&amp;nbsp; We traded wives for instruction and sure enough, each taught the others wife to fly without much difficulty.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was that I was a horny bastard back then and his wife was hot as hell with a similar sex drive.&amp;nbsp; We both ended up getting divorces, and there went the business. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15345882</next>\n<prev>15345822</prev>\n<first>15343842</first>\n<last>15411749</last>\n<when>1320884702</when>\n<utime>11/10/11 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
