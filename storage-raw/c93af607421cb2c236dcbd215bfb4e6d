When you use a single sporeprint, hundreds of 'strains' are created.  By way of dikaryotic/dikaryotic pairings, they reduce down in the end to a sigle or just a few strains by fruiting time. I've done it many times.  If you doubt this, try mixing a few syringes of different strains into the same jar.  Instead of 2cc's from a single syringe, try using 1/2cc from four different syringes(different strains).  Do a couple of control jars that are single strain.  I'll bet ya a dollar you can't tell jar from jar at fruiting time just by looking.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5376883</next>\n<prev>5376121</prev>\n<first>5376002</first>\n<last>5376883</last>\n<when>1141832836</when>\n<utime>03/08/06 05:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
