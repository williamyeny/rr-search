Uncased substrates will fruit a week to ten days sooner because there's no casing layer to colonize.  However, the pinset will not be as good, nor the fruits as large generally as the same strain would make if you applied the casing layer upon full colonization.   Hyphae is right.  You shouldn't apply casing over the pins.  You might get away with it a few times, but once the primordia begin to form, they are very delicate.  A simple misting can sometimes 86 them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5665508</next>\n<prev>5664601</prev>\n<first>5661058</first>\n<last>5665583</last>\n<when>1148417121</when>\n<utime>05/23/06 11:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
