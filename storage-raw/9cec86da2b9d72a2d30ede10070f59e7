One or the other is probably a bad guy, especially if they don't merge into a common whole.  If one is mold as I suspect, you'll see a color change soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jar pictures are a challenge.  Try putting two lights at a 45 degree angle to the jar, so that the jar, your two lights, and the camera form the four corners of a box.  That prevents glare from coming back to the camera. Disable the flash. If you must use a flash, spray the jar with a touch of deodorant.  The satin finish from the deodorant spray will dissipate the flash, giving a clearer picture.  News reporters in the field often use that trick, spraying deodorant on their faces just before going on camera since they don't have access to makeup at a fire or accident scene.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6663524</next>\n<prev>6662209</prev>\n<first>6662106</first>\n<last>6678525</last>\n<when>1173749521</when>\n<utime>03/13/07 04:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
