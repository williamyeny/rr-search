Once you get some experience, there's ways to get more product, but they also come with a higher risk of failure.&amp;nbsp; Crawl before you walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brf cakes are also the fastest way to go from spores or liquid culture to fruits.&amp;nbsp; Many long-time growers use them to prove strains after doing strain isolation.&amp;nbsp; Don't listen to the cake bashers.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who screws up the brf tek should be too embarrassed to admit it in public.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9713364</prev>\n<first>9713213</first>\n<last>9713374</last>\n<when>1233450591</when>\n<utime>02/01/09 03:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
