Plastic is much easier to work with and you don't have to clean or sterilize them.  They come out of the package sterile.  Use once and throw away. They cost less than a dime each. You can't wash and resterilize a glass one for that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5453954</next>\n<prev>5453931</prev>\n<first>5453931</first>\n<last>5457071</last>\n<when>1143629635</when>\n<utime>03/29/06 12:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
