The kernels are so large, you'll only get a fraction of the amount of spawn per jar you will with wbs or rye.  Additionally, when you spawn popcorn to bulk and shake it, the large area takes longer to recover, which leaves an opening for trich spores to land on the popcorn and germinate before the mycelium has time to recover.  Popcorn is also much more prone to bacterial contamination than rye.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5507195</next>\n<prev>5506882</prev>\n<first>5506882</first>\n<last>5507241</last>\n<when>1144854214</when>\n<utime>04/12/06 06:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
