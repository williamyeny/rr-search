The only way alcohol kills cells is when it penetrates the cell wall, and then evaporates back out.  Alcohol by itself, if it doesn't penetrate the cell wall isn't toxic.  That's why 70% alcohol works better than pure alcohol.  The water 'tricks' the cell wall into admitting it, and then the alcohol evaporates back out from the inside, destroying the cell.  Cells admit moisture by osmosis, and therefore exclude toxins such as alcohol unless water is mixed in with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try using oust instead to sanitize the air.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plants and mycology in the same area don't mix well.  Plants attract predators and insects, and generally are swarming with bacterial colonies and molds.  In fact, mold such as trichoderma are beneficial to plants.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6828178</next>\n<prev>6828107</prev>\n<first>6828107</first>\n<last>6828239</last>\n<when>1177452686</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
