The shavings have too much distance between them and the mycelium has to waste energy crossing the long distances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to live in Abilene.  Mesquite is an excellent substrate for all wood lovers.  Ditto for hickory.  You can help fill in the cracks between the woodchips with cottonseed hulls, which are plentyful.  Good luck.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5926339</next>\n<prev>5925805</prev>\n<first>5925394</first>\n<last>18953816</last>\n<when>1154555239</when>\n<utime>08/03/06 12:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
