I think it's important to assume the results are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; from what we suspect until after many trials. That's just good science. I've posted for years that ten percent bleach won't kill mushroom mycelium(or molds), but I have never noticed an &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in performance after using it.  I'm not saying there isn't a correlation either, but the jury needs to remain out until more trials by other growers come in. Research is how we all learn. Good luck to all!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7695078</next>\n<prev>7690103</prev>\n<first>7682453</first>\n<last>7720237</last>\n<when>1196278276</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
