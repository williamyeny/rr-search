Layering will give faster colonization with less damage to your spawn than mixing.  You'll have more success with thinner substrate layers.  Don't even attempt a six or seven inch thick horse manure substrate.  They will heat up, and also have the tendency to go anaerobic in the core, leading to contamination.  You'll get far more bang for the buck with two trays of 3 inch substrate layers than one tray with 6 inches.  Horse manure fruits very well uncased.  A properly made peat/verm casing layer will increase yields, but is by no means necessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7005799</next>\n<prev>7005793</prev>\n<first>7005245</first>\n<last>7005841</last>\n<when>1180934339</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 08:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
