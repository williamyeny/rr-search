If the water in your area is polluted or otherwise bad, use filtered or spring water.  The chlorine in tap water won't hurt the mycelium.  Bleach is non-toxic to mycelium in those and even higher quantities.   I often dip outdoor mushroom tissue into a ten percent bleach solution for five minutes before cloning to kill off bacteria.  The mushroom mycelium (and mold mycelium) recovers, but the bacteria is killed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6841229</next>\n<prev>6841071</prev>\n<first>6840592</first>\n<last>6844751</last>\n<when>1177697296</when>\n<utime>04/27/07 09:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
