The dunk is done in cold water in the refrigerator to lessen the chances of bacteria taking over your cake during the dunk.  This is not cold shocking.  Cold shocking is necessary for cold weather edibles that only fruit in the fall.  Tropical species such as cubensis that fruit From Texas to Florida during the spring, summer and fall do not benefit from a cold shock. If you picked up the cake and could tell from the weight that it is very light, I'd suggest a dunk.   Otherwise, patience is the key.  A week after exposing to fruiting conditions is not too long to wait. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4145323</next>\n<prev>4145043</prev>\n<first>4145009</first>\n<last>4146220</last>\n<when>1115465612</when>\n<utime>05/07/05 02:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
