It must of had some issues before hand. It was warm to the touch but not hot. I gave it a Lil knock as it was 70 percent and it broke in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not related to warming up the jar although you have to be careful doing that.&amp;nbsp; The jar was screwed.&amp;nbsp; Be sure you're using actual mason jars and not pickle jars.&amp;nbsp; Even with mason jars, they don't last forever.&amp;nbsp; The repeated heat/cool cycles degrades them and eventually all jars will break.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19551435</next>\n<prev>19551181</prev>\n<first>19550370</first>\n<last>19551594</last>\n<when>1392125392</when>\n<utime>02/11/14 03:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
