Pour from the donor jar to the open receiving jar, then replace the lid as one unit.  Have the receiving jar open for no more than a few seconds when doing this.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edited to change my mistake above.  I meant to say receiving jar open for only a few seconds, not donor jar.  I leave the donor jar open the whole time.&lt;/i&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6668580</next>\n<prev>6668504</prev>\n<first>6664612</first>\n<last>6669036</last>\n<when>1173894917</when>\n<utime>03/14/07 08:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
