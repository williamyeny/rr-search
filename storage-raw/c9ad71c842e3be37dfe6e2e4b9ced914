To fail to rinse is only asking for trouble later due to sticky grains that are hard to break apart.  Being lazy will not get one far in this hobby. Rinse the dry grains well until the water you pour off is clear.  Then soak for 24 hours or so, then boil for five minutes.  Drain in to a collander will still boiling and allow to drain for a few minutes, then shake the grains around in the collander so all surface moisture can evaporate off.  When the grains appear dry on the surface, load your jars and PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a tablespoon of gypsum for each two gallons of soak water.  If you are adding gypsum to the jars after loading, use a pinch between your thumb and forefinger for each jar.  If you can't find gypsum at a nursery, just buy a sheet of drywall and break it up to get the gypsum out from between the sheets of paper.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5798410</prev>\n<first>5797036</first>\n<last>5798830</last>\n<when>1151510615</when>\n<utime>06/28/06 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
