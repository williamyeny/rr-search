Bleach is HIGHLY alkaline, not acidic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've posted for years that bleach doesn't kill fungi.  Even some spores, such as Cordyceps can survive several minutes in a ten percent bleach solution and still germinate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however suspect that any increase in pinning on the bleach sprayed casing layer was due to genetic differences and not attributable to the bleach.  Bleach spray will abort pins.  They don't appreciate it at all.  In addition, there is no need to subject a perfectly healthy cake to bleach.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7606739</next>\n<prev>7606724</prev>\n<first>7606011</first>\n<last>7662244</last>\n<when>1194463501</when>\n<utime>11/07/07 09:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
