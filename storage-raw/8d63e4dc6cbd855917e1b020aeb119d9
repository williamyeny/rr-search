I suspect it's your inoculant at fault, since all the mold is at the bottom of the jar where that stuff ran.&amp;nbsp; If it was the filter, the mold would be on top, and if it was due to bad sterilization, the mold would be throughout the jar.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18942266</next>\n<prev>18941893</prev>\n<first>18932610</first>\n<last>18942454</last>\n<when>1381110655</when>\n<utime>10/07/13 04:50 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
