{"key":"post-7487525","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7487525</id>\n<content>If your contamination problem was mold, then it was introduced after you sterilized your jars.  Water boils at 212F, and molds are killed above 135F.  Rather than look at your sterilization method, I'd suggest you look at your sterile procedure later when you inoculated the jars.  Good luck in the future.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7489587</next>\n<prev>7487025</prev>\n<first>7480953</first>\n<last>8003908</last>\n<when>1191589386</when>\n<utime>10/05/07 04:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
