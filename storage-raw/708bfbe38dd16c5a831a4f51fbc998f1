It would use up all your grain, and any mistakes you might make would wipe out the whole thing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest using each of your six quarts in their own small trays.  Peat/verm makes a nice casing.  A perlite terrarium will be fine.  Just be sure to make a lot of holes in it or fan a few times per day.  Agreed, you don't need to heat.  70 is great for fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6506066</next>\n<prev>6505579</prev>\n<first>6505569</first>\n<last>6527276</last>\n<when>1170031369</when>\n<utime>01/29/07 02:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
