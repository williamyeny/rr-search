{"key":"post-6597333","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6597333</id>\n<content>50/50 should be pasteurized.  It's for the peat though, not the verm.  Of course, if a bag of verm has been sitting around open, it never hurts to zap or otherwise heat it up first.  That should take care of any mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 50/50 unpasteurized for many edibles, but air exchange has to be kept really high or cobweb eats it up.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6619149</next>\n<prev>6597305</prev>\n<first>6594081</first>\n<last>6619149</last>\n<when>1172176407</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 10:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
