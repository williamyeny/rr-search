On the next batch, try to control the flies with sticky traps before they get into your substrates to breed.  You might try some DE to see if it works, but it only works when dry, and it won't stay dry for long on a substrate.  Disposal is probably the best option.  You could bury them into manure or compost in a shady spot outside to get a crop.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6912987</prev>\n<first>6912987</first>\n<last>6915561</last>\n<when>1179184612</when>\n<utime>05/15/07 02:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
