You'll want to run a small heater in the room with the fruiting chamber.  Don't heat it from the bottom.  Anything around 70F will be fine for fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need high humidity in a fruiting chamber, and heating one will cause excessive condensation.  The humidity you want for the mushrooms will be wasted sticking to the sides as condensation if there's a temperature difference between the fruiting chamber and the room it's located in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6400479</next>\n<prev>6400400</prev>\n<first>6399648</first>\n<last>6401002</last>\n<when>1166931865</when>\n<utime>12/24/06 05:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
