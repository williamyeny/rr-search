That trigger, whatever it is seems to occur later than the time I picked the above pins.  I believe it originates from within the mycelial network itself rather than in individual fruits, because I've cloned a lot of pins like this and also done g2g from jars that were pinning invitro, and never had a pin fail to break down like these did back into extremely aggressive mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5705714</next>\n<prev>5704419</prev>\n<first>5703541</first>\n<last>5708903</last>\n<when>1149291447</when>\n<utime>06/03/06 02:37 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
