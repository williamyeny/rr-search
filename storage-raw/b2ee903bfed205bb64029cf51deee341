Simply hydrate the manure properly, then place in quart jars and pasteurize in a large kettle such as a boiling pot or PC.  Use a meat thermometer to hold the center of the substrate at 140F to 160F for one hour.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6410312</next>\n<prev>6410273</prev>\n<first>6410273</first>\n<last>6411806</last>\n<when>1167501447</when>\n<utime>12/30/06 07:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
