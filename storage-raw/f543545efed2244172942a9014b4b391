They will be far more likely to contaminate. Second, that's too much lime.  A good starting point is one TEAspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If desired, you can use oyster shells at up to ten percent, but they really don't do much but improve texture, and vermiculite does a better job.  Oyster shells would take months to break down to give useful amounts of calcium, so for that, use gypsum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8455480</next>\n<prev>8455226</prev>\n<first>8450251</first>\n<last>8458957</last>\n<when>1212004272</when>\n<utime>05/28/08 10:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
