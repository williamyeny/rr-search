It is supposed to stop air currents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go into the field to get wild specimens for cloning, I take clear plastic trash bags with latex gloves and a petri dish in each one.  A clear trash or oven bag makes an excellent ghetto glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5194477</next>\n<prev>5193226</prev>\n<first>5193104</first>\n<last>5194879</last>\n<when>1137575938</when>\n<utime>01/18/06 11:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
