The mycelium on the bottom of the jar looks normal, but two distinct growths in the side shot means one of them ain't the right stuff.  Bummer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are easily killed off during steriliztion, so when they appear, they were introduced at inoculation.  Pay very careful attention to sterile procedures next time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6164237</prev>\n<first>6163745</first>\n<last>6164389</last>\n<when>1160718111</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 08:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
