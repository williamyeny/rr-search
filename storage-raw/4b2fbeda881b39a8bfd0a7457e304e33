If they're drying out, chances are, your gas exchange holes are too big.  You don't want more than four 1/8&quot; (3mm) holes.  You could even get by with smaller holes.  I use four 3/32&quot; (2.4mm) holes for both 1/2 pint pf cakes and full quart grain jars.  Larger holes can dry out the material and encourage invitro pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, a substrate on the dry side will colonize faster than an overly wet one, so if your jars didn't colonize, something else might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also a good idea in a dry climate to run a humidifier in the room your grow is located to raise the ambient humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7126263</next>\n<prev>7126157</prev>\n<first>7124894</first>\n<last>7127926</last>\n<when>1183517989</when>\n<utime>07/04/07 05:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
