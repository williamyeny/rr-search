My preference is to apply the casing at the time you spawn the grains into the tray.  This way, as the mycelium knits itself back together, it also begins to colonize the casing layer.  However, many growers let the mycelium on the grains recover for a few days, and then add the casing layer.  Either way will work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7861277</next>\n<prev>7861158</prev>\n<first>7859508</first>\n<last>7863655</last>\n<when>1200019469</when>\n<utime>01/11/08 04:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
