For plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms don't drink their food however, and can't grow hydroponically.  Mushrooms actually eat(consume) their food, and that's why cakes or other substrates shrink with each flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a few experiments several years ago where I added fish emulsion and several other nitrogen boosters such as blood meal to manure and compost mixes and saw no effect on the crop.  I then added small amounts of chicken manure and saw a very noticeable increase in yield.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and let us know what happens.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6306629</next>\n<prev>6306278</prev>\n<first>6305378</first>\n<last>6307936</last>\n<when>1164697223</when>\n<utime>11/28/06 09:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
