Also running those bulbs u guys got on timers is one of the 1st indications of illegal growing activities. thats how people get busted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That coupled with all the other energy gains that are required for these techs, are noticible. Not just energy, but water as well. So if you havent just moved into the place, and are getting all these increases, its a red flag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't speak of that which you have no clue.&amp;nbsp; A compact fluorescent lamp uses about 1/10 or less the amount of electricity as your TV set.&amp;nbsp; It isn't a red flag, and you can mist a terrarium or mix up a batch of grain or brf jars for the same amount of water you use in the first two minutes or less of your shower.&amp;nbsp; There are no red flags energy-wise that would point to someone growing mushrooms.&amp;nbsp; Those who get popped do so by being stupid in their local community, driving around tripping, or going to raves/parties with mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP: Yes, mushrooms grow more during the dark cycle.&amp;nbsp; We've known that for many years.&amp;nbsp; They still benefit most from 12/12 because they use light as an energy source to convert sugars in the substrate into ATP within the cells.&amp;nbsp; Light is a pinning trigger also, but is equally important all the way to harvest.&amp;nbsp; In addition, brighter light in the neighborhood of 2,000 lux will produce more pins, and the mushrooms will have larger caps and higher finish weight than they will if insufficient lighting is used.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12538742</next>\n<prev>12538661</prev>\n<first>12538088</first>\n<last>12543609</last>\n<when>1273535586</when>\n<utime>05/11/10 02:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
