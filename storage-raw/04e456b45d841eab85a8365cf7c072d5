The problem is only texture.   I've used bagged up cow manure and bagged up chicken manure with great results.  Use about five percent or less chicken manure, then fluff up the steer manure with some coir and coffee grinds.  A bit of perlite and/or vermiculite will help keep it loose as well.  Add ten percent gypsum, and you'll grow some great mushrooms on it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6398297</next>\n<prev>6398103</prev>\n<first>6395871</first>\n<last>6398297</last>\n<when>1166848349</when>\n<utime>12/23/06 06:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
