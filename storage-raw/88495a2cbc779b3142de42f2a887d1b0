In my opinion, it's counterproductive to go for a fourth or possibly even a third flush.  Just always start new jars once per week, so as old cakes retire, new ones can take their place.  This is the most effecient use of your growing space.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5757401</prev>\n<first>5757401</first>\n<last>5757432</last>\n<when>1150487544</when>\n<utime>06/16/06 10:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
