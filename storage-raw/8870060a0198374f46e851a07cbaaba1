You can't keep all those mold spores out by wrapping with a tarp or anything else.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air exchange is the number one pinning trigger, so as soon as you start circulating air in the FC, all that mold is going to become airborne and go straight to your projects. Find another grow area.&amp;nbsp; Your toilet is probably cleaner.&amp;nbsp; Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9426190</next>\n<prev>9425588</prev>\n<first>9425482</first>\n<last>9429483</last>\n<when>1229217204</when>\n<utime>12/14/08 03:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
