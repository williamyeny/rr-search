You want to use a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of peat, so if that's what you have, you should have used a teaspoon and a half, not 1/8 cup.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it takes four or five days for mycelium to break through the surface.  The mycelium itself needs 24 to 48 hours just to recover from the shock of breaking it up to start colonizing again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6147814</next>\n<prev>6147649</prev>\n<first>6147618</first>\n<last>6149442</last>\n<when>1160360158</when>\n<utime>10/09/06 05:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
