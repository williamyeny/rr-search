I absolutely love this - it's alot of fun:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my 2nd PF tek grow has been a non-event. No worries whatsoever. I'm not freakin out. Just having fun learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made 24 BRF cakes, inoculated them, about a half dozen blasted out of the gates and colonized in a week, another half dozen were a week behind these, another 6 are maybe a week behind those, and the last 6 I'm questioning whether they'll ever do anything - there is some very light myc growth; but, it's been awhile now and nothing's really happening with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of those that have colonized to date, i let them consolidate, dunk-n-rolled em, and then put them in my SGFC (see pic) which does maintain at least 95% humidity. these cakes get misted perhaps 5 to 6 times per day, and get fanned after each misting. funny thing is - this time around - nothing is happening. the oldest cakes have now been in the FC for 10 days and absolutely nothing. well, i say nothing, but some are growing this cotton looking stuff (see pic). any idea what this white stuff is? if it's cotton, i'll knit some panties. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-25/011145926-SGFC.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/12-25/011145926-thumb_SGFC.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/12-25/011146299-cotton.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/12-25/011146299-thumb_cotton.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like mold to me.&amp;nbsp; I say it will be green in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;BRF cakes&lt;/a&gt; don't colonize in a week with mushroom mycelium.&amp;nbsp; That's about how long it takes to see the first signs of germination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16402539</next>\n<prev>16402324</prev>\n<first>16402279</first>\n<last>16402539</last>\n<when>1340115669</when>\n<utime>06/19/12 05:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
