Poop bird poop, which in turn helps distribute them. So-on and so-forth.....that's the gist of it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not the egrets, which mostly eat horse flies off cows and horses backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a long-established fact that fields can be started by putting sporeprints into cattle water troughs.&amp;nbsp; However, it's going to take a year or two to get established, and five years for any real product to come.&amp;nbsp; Don't pick any mushrooms for the first three years, so they can drop spores into the grass, which will be eaten by the cows. . .and the process repeats.&amp;nbsp; Growing indoors is much faster.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14575909</next>\n<prev>14575416</prev>\n<first>14571456</first>\n<last>14576051</last>\n<when>1307491461</when>\n<utime>06/08/11 03:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
