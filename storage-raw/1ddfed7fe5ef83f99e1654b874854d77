Although I do agree that that is a contam. You have 2 options in my opinion. Either A) toss it like stated above and you will be 100% safe. Or B) What I would likely do is take it outside, Lysol a 10 foot radius around where you are going to open it and the air around it and the tub itself. Carefully open it with your sanitary tools nearby and a fresh casing layer(something different this time, simple like coco coir and verm so its less likely to infect). Then open it carefully and first mist with water containing some diluted h2o2(lowers risk of spores). Then take your tools and remove all of the casing you can, infected or not. put it in a trashbag nearby. Then spray again with h2o2, and recase and seal it up. Throw the trashbag in your dumpster, sanitize your hands, and spray lysol on your sealed tub, your tools, anything around that area, and yourself. Then either continue to fruit it outside(safest), Or take it inside and continue to fruit inside(slight risk, but low if you follow clean steps). Either way, if the contam comes back then toss it. If it doesnt... then you win. Make SURE to use a different casing material if you take option B, and be as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very bad advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can move contaminated substrates to an outdoor area, but don't scrape or otherwise try to 'fix them'.&amp;nbsp; Doing so pukes millions of mold spores all over you, your hair, under your fingernails, on your clothes, etc., and you bring all this back indoors with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, removing the 'mold' from the top casing layer only removes the spores.&amp;nbsp; The mold mycelium is infused within the substrate and does not go away.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll not find anyone who's been growing mushrooms for more than a year recommending this. Early thoughts of 'success' turn into total disaster after a few times when the grower realizes that he can no longer grow in that house, no matter what he does.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15136978</next>\n<prev>15115290</prev>\n<first>15112373</first>\n<last>15141578</last>\n<when>1317045125</when>\n<utime>09/26/11 04:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
