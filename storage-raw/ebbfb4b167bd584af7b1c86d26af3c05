(you want 15 psi of steam, not compressed air)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's totally irrelevant how long it takes to reach 15 psi.&amp;nbsp; The pressure won't start climbing until the contents of the bags are at the same temperature as the steam.&amp;nbsp; When pressure is reached, set timer for 90 minutes for grains.&amp;nbsp; Never pop the toggle or lift the weight off to release pressure when time is reached.&amp;nbsp; Allow it to slowly drop as the sterilizer cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown in Let's Grow Mushrooms, place spacers between bags to allow the steam to totally surround each individual bag.&amp;nbsp; I like to use tyvek sleeves to provide for filtering, while also making it easier to open the 'sealed' bags after the pc cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, if you're using less than 15 psi/121C, increase sterilization time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>26945335</next>\n<prev>26945270</prev>\n<first>26944015</first>\n<last>26947502</last>\n<when>1600586183</when>\n<utime>09/20/20 10:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
