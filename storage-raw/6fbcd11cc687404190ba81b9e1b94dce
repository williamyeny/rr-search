Wet peat moss will begin to grow green molds within a week or two.  You want perlite.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative to perlite if you don't have it is to simply keep some damp paper towels in the bottom of the fruiting chamber.  The paper towels will evaporate moisture just as the perlite will, thus creating humidity.  Replace them every few days to prevent the paper from growing molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6089707</prev>\n<first>6089197</first>\n<last>6089865</last>\n<when>1158945058</when>\n<utime>09/22/06 08:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
