But it seems like on all the cakes only one pin kept going. One of the cakes didint show anymore growth after the dunk, like his pins disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was your first mistake.&amp;nbsp; You should remove the cakes from the jars a week to ten days after full colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, when 'pf' wrote the first part of that tek, he was a beginning noob.&amp;nbsp; Little did he know that although rice bran and verm had been used for many years at that time, one should let nature decide when to pin, not some oxygen starved mycelium in a jar trying to survive.&amp;nbsp; Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15026736</next>\n<prev>15026681</prev>\n<first>15026467</first>\n<last>15050634</last>\n<when>1315147720</when>\n<utime>09/04/11 05:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
