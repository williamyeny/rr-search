Dunked for 25 hours though so not sure how I could have prevented this. I guess by putting in a saucer like mentioned earlier. I figured they would be fine since they fruited so fast. Well at least that cake did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're giving the correct amount of fresh air, your cakes &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; dry out, even after dunking.&amp;nbsp; This is a major pinning trigger, so always give lots of air.&amp;nbsp; You just have to mist enough to allow the cakes to recover their moisture content.&amp;nbsp; Let them dry out somewhat, and then mist to replace it.&amp;nbsp; You can also pile some verm on top of the cake and soak it mid flush if necessary.&amp;nbsp; Or, the saucer trick works well too.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19279782</next>\n<prev>19279430</prev>\n<first>19277107</first>\n<last>19282563</last>\n<when>1387144259</when>\n<utime>12/15/13 11:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
