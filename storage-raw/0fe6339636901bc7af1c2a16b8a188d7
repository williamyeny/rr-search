That's why it's used.  The other main ingredient in gypsum is sulphur, which lowers pH to keep the calcium from raising it too much.  That's why gypsum works well without swinging the pH too much either direction.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6758066</next>\n<prev>6757873</prev>\n<first>6754221</first>\n<last>6758107</last>\n<when>1175976261</when>\n<utime>04/07/07 11:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
