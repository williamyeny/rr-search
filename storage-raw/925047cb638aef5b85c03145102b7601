If you insist on using an electric blanket, put it OVER the product, not under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knead the bag between your fingers to break up and mix the mycelium that is growing around the bag.  This will get many more spots inoculated and growing.  Room temp works great, up to about 81F.  You don't need that blanket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't offer money again for help.  We love the hobby here and share and trade ideas.  It isn't about money.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6606242</next>\n<prev>6606203</prev>\n<first>6606203</first>\n<last>6607000</last>\n<when>1172362256</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 02:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
