(PF classic being slow as all hell and Cambodians/Hawaiians being fast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my point so beautifully.  PF classic used to be one of my favorites, with nice large meaty fruits, cambodians were weak and small, and there is NO Hawaii cubensis.  Cubensis is not native to the islands.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why discussion of strains is lame, and relegated to the noob closet. There are LOT'S of factors that are important in growing, so to be a viable source of information, we try to provide information on those factors, and strain simply doesn't happen to be one of them.  It seems that every guy who finds a new cow patch with a cube on it takes a print and claims a new strain.  Jeez, what makes a cube from farmer bills pasture any different from a cube on farmer john's pasture? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and tahoe, you know what mr g can do. 8=======D&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7952441</next>\n<prev>7952353</prev>\n<first>7946995</first>\n<last>7955062</last>\n<when>1201662047</when>\n<utime>01/30/08 05:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
