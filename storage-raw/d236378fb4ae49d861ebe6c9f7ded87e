Never re-inoculate.&amp;nbsp; If the jars didn't colonize, there's a reason.&amp;nbsp; Make up new jars and try again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16185369</next>\n<prev>16185158</prev>\n<first>16182794</first>\n<last>16187499</last>\n<when>1336230492</when>\n<utime>05/05/12 06:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
