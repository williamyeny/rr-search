{"key":"post-6728840","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6728840</id>\n<content>After picking a flush, allow the substrate to 'rest' for several days to a week.  Let it dry out somewhat during this time.  A substrate will not flush again right away.  After the 'rest period', give it an overnight soak to bring the moisture content back up and place into fruiting conditions.  Dunking right away is counterproductive because the mycelium is dormant for a few days and the dunk only supplies moisture to the contaminant molds that might be present, then it dries out before that moisture is actually needed for the next flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6728843</next>\n<prev>6728830</prev>\n<first>6728396</first>\n<last>6730256</last>\n<when>1175293910</when>\n<utime>03/31/07 01:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
