But if you do have one of the those two items, you can just leave the lid off the petri dishes slightly off so the condensation does not build up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never do this.&amp;nbsp; Condensation isn't half as bad as letting contaminants get in.&amp;nbsp; Even if a flowhood is 99.99% efficient, enough contaminants will get through to ruin your culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, pour the dishes, and then re-insert them into the sleeve they came out of if you do all 20 at once, or else slip them into a brand new ziplock bag to cool.&amp;nbsp; Inoculate the next day after the agar solidifies.&amp;nbsp; Wrap with parafilm at that time, and then place back into ziplock bags to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14992219</next>\n<prev>14991698</prev>\n<first>14990861</first>\n<last>15077121</last>\n<when>1314566329</when>\n<utime>08/29/11 12:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
