The perlite was still damp, and at least half of this time, the lid was off.  I think you're mistaken.  You can judge moisture content of the perlite by lifting the tub.  Dry perlite is almost weightless.  My huge 3 cubic foot bag probably weighs a pound or less.  The terrarium I lifted up weighed at least ten pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your house is extremely dry, you'd be well advised to run a humidifier in the room your grow is located in.  It will make it better for your plants, and it will be easier on your own skin and lungs as well.  Shoot for an indoor humidity of 50% or better for comfort.  It will also make it much easier to heat your house in winter because the humidity will hold heat much better than dry air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6710250</next>\n<prev>6710170</prev>\n<first>6705952</first>\n<last>6711821</last>\n<when>1174863384</when>\n<utime>03/26/07 01:56 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
