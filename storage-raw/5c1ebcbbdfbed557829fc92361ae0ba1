The former is what they use to line the wire cage for hanging baskets before adding soil, and it holds very little water.  Peat moss is finely ground and holds many times its own weight in water.  You can use jiffy mix or sunshine mix #3 for casing material.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5733364</next>\n<prev>5731385</prev>\n<first>5726696</first>\n<last>5733364</last>\n<when>1149896801</when>\n<utime>06/10/06 02:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
