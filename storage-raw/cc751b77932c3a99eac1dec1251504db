They'll be smaller and deformed, but will still do their job very well.  When they're fully formed, simply bang the jar against a car tire a few times.  The grains and fruits will separate out and you can pour the contents of the jar into a dish for separation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4788294</next>\n<prev>4787611</prev>\n<first>4787253</first>\n<last>4788294</last>\n<when>1129064690</when>\n<utime>10/12/05 12:04 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
