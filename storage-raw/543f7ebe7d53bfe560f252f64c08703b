I know he's an expert but he's not the only guy in the world who knows about mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically all I want to know is pink or blue oysters for eating plastic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither. I've never seen oyster mushrooms consume enough plastic to make a difference. It might be a novelty to watch ten pounds of oyster mycelium consume a few grams of plastic, but it's not going to change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got one isolated strain(from spores) of shiitake which will eat through plastic filter-patch bags, causing the contents to spill out on the shelf.&amp;nbsp; If plastic sheeting is covering the shelves, the mycelium will then eat through it too.&amp;nbsp; I'll be experimenting more with this culture next summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I doubt it's the mycelium but rather the metabolites &lt;i&gt;produced by the mycelium&lt;/i&gt; that are doing the actual work.&amp;nbsp; This might not be the case when the culture and plastic are in the ground, surrounded by other competing organisms.&amp;nbsp; Lab results seldom mimick real world results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no one best species for mycoremediation.&amp;nbsp; The idea is to find a species which is native to the area and which will consume the undesired pollutant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Our farm&lt;/a&gt; has been working on a bio-myco remediation project where we've used over 1000 oyster substrate blocks so far to contain and digest the effluent from a series of leaking septic tanks from homes near the banks of a pristine mountain lake.&amp;nbsp; At the end of last summer, the coliform bacteria count in the stream was down by over 90%.&amp;nbsp; Part of this job was &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedstock.com/2013/02/06/electrical-engineer-leverages-knowledge-of-leds-and-green-tech-to-sustainably-grow-organic-mushrooms/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;covered in an article&lt;/a&gt; published last month.&amp;nbsp; You can tell from reading it the reporter was not a mycologist, but she did a pretty good job for someone not familiar with fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest problems with myco-based remediation efforts is that the progress stops during the winter when the mycelium can no longer function due to temperature, but the bacteria or other pollutants keeps getting dumped into the soil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's way too much hype and ego stroking in this field, and I'm sick to tears of seeing 'research' manipulated to suit the pre-stated goal.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms can and will play a part in natural recycling efforts, but they're not an end all and cure all despite what you'll read elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reducing the &lt;i&gt;amount of waste&lt;/i&gt; will go much farther towards cleaning up the planet than what mycelium can consume.&amp;nbsp; When you prepare a meal at home and throw away more weight in plastic and styrofoam than you consume in food, it's an unsustainable model, plastic-eating mycelium or not.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17885064</next>\n<prev>17884871</prev>\n<first>17873985</first>\n<last>17885064</last>\n<when>1362149317</when>\n<utime>03/01/13 04:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
