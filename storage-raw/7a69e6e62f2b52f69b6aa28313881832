Jars in an incubator are the same temperature inside as they are outside. (Especially a new grower who has half a dozen cakes in a cooler, which is who this discussion is typically about.)&lt;br /&gt;They have to be- think about it. Put a jar of myc in the fridge, it gets cold all the way through. It doesn't stay warm in the middle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just getting ridiculous now.&amp;nbsp; If you put a colonizing jar in the refrigerator, the metabolic activity slows down, thus heat is not being generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature inside a colonizing jar, whether inside or outside an 'incubator' is definitely going to be higher.&amp;nbsp; Since glass is an insulator, shooting IR at the surface of the glass, which is exposed to the outside air is going to read less than a thermocouple inserted inside the jar.&amp;nbsp; Thus, with a thermocouple, you'd see an even greater temp differential.&amp;nbsp; This is not even something to argue about.&amp;nbsp; It's been proved by everyone who's ever grown, and written about in mycology books for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my underground farm, the ground surrounding it pulls heat from the air within, helping to regulate temperature.&amp;nbsp; If the farm was above ground and insulated properly, I wouldn't have to heat it, but cooling would be a bitch.&amp;nbsp; Paul Stamets has a 10,000 square feet colonization room, which he doesn't heat in the winter.&amp;nbsp; In fact, he pumps warm air from the colonization areas to other parts of his operation, thus saving energy.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11547665</next>\n<prev>11547560</prev>\n<first>11545725</first>\n<last>17880317</last>\n<when>1259510240</when>\n<utime>11/29/09 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
