During the spawn run, you want your substrate nearly sealed up, with little to no air exchange.  A small amount of gas exchange is all that's required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want CO2 to build up as the mycelium is colonizing the substrate.  If you fan early, it will cause all sorts of problems.  Air exchange/CO2 drop is the number two pinning trigger, second only to full colonization of the substrate. Light is the third most important pinning trigger, so apply all three simultaneously when you are ready to initiate pinning.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5945955</prev>\n<first>5945583</first>\n<last>5945979</last>\n<when>1155097685</when>\n<utime>08/09/06 07:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
