How did you get all those burst kernels?  That is definitely bad and will encourage bacteria.  There &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be NO burst kernels, but a few are ok.  It looks like you have nearly 50%, which is definitely bad and will cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking overnight will slowly hydrate the grains, resulting in no bursting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6607946</next>\n<prev>6605915</prev>\n<first>6605844</first>\n<last>6612491</last>\n<when>1172359909</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 01:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
