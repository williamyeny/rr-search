It doesn't make any logical sense. As soon as you start drying the grains they're being exposed to brand new endospores. It's not like people prepare their grains in sterile conditions, so the concept is stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't call that which you fail to understand &lt;i&gt;stupid.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; It degrades yourself needlessly and that's not necessary.&amp;nbsp; Endospore germination in warm water is not a myth, but fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endospores do germinate/soften during the soak, making them more susceptible to being killed off in the pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; They do not get exposed to more endospores during drying because endospores are formed by bacteria in the grains while in the farmers field, not from the air.&amp;nbsp; You won't find bacterial endospores floating around in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're correct about hydrating the grains slowly.&amp;nbsp; The original poster should rinse first with hot tap water to remove the dust/chaff, and then soak for a few hours before boiling as shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Grain-Preparation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;grain preparation video tek.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17555925</next>\n<prev>17555678</prev>\n<first>17555537</first>\n<last>17555947</last>\n<when>1358344727</when>\n<utime>01/16/13 03:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
