Not only is sterilization in a jar or bag not always complete, but many filter patch bags have defective filters these days which change pore size during sterilization.&amp;nbsp; The longer you let one sit, the less your chances of success are.&amp;nbsp; We sterilize a few thousand large filter patch bags per week on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountainmushroomfarm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;our farm&lt;/a&gt;, so we're able to get a better handle exactly how to achieve the &lt;i&gt;maximum possible&lt;/i&gt; success rate since our livelihood depends on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I've used grain jars up to a year old before with success.&amp;nbsp; It's just not recommended, especially if you're going to use it later for grain to grain transfers.&amp;nbsp; Often the mycelium can hold its own against competitors until after a few transfers when the contaminant gets ahead on the uncolonized grains and takes over.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18356148</next>\n<prev>18355815</prev>\n<first>18350198</first>\n<last>18356191</last>\n<when>1370149307</when>\n<utime>06/02/13 08:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
