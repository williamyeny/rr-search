If you're going to misuse them to grow a controlled substance, keep it to yourself.&amp;nbsp; Any post which says, &quot;I'm going to grow psychedelic mushrooms with spores from 'such and such' vendor, will be deleted and you'll receive an official warning.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Do not bump your own thread for at least 24 hours.&amp;nbsp; It's not fair to the other posters to have your thread constantly bumped to the top.&amp;nbsp; Violators will have their thread deleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; No flaming in mushroom cultivation.&amp;nbsp; If you're unable to post without showing disrespect to others, take it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Do NOT ask strain questions in cultivation.&amp;nbsp; There is a sticky thread at the top of the page for such nonsense.&amp;nbsp; 'Strain' in mushrooms is not the same as strain in pot growing, thus we keep 'strain talk' sequestered in it's own dungeon so people won't think it actually matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Be smart.&amp;nbsp; We're not the 'mommy police' here, but please don't incriminate yourself.&amp;nbsp; It's a mistake to assume only members with a similar interest in mycology are reading the board.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This sticky will be updated as necessary, so please check back often.**</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>14960143</prev>\n<first>14960143</first>\n<last>14960147</last>\n<when>1314026617</when>\n<utime>08/22/11 06:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
