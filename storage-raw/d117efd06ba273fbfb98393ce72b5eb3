Don't put the chips out until you're ready to spawn, or other fungi will get a foothold in them first.  I'd suggest growing out grains, and using those grains to inoculate as many supplemented sawdust/woodchip bags you can, allowing them to colonize over the winter.  Use your colonized woodchip blocks to inoculate your freshly made and watered beds in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7652486</next>\n<prev>7652417</prev>\n<first>7621082</first>\n<last>7653326</last>\n<when>1195441728</when>\n<utime>11/19/07 05:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
