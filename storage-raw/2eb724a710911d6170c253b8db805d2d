Peroxide doesn't kill molds except for cobweb, which is whispy and grey.  I don't see any of that, and cobweb generally isn't a contaminant of cakes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide is as damaging to mushroom mycelium as anything, so you shouldn't just spray it on your cake.  It will weaken the mushroom mycelium, allowing the faster growing molds to get a foothold on your substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6890635</next>\n<prev>6889168</prev>\n<first>6889084</first>\n<last>6890635</last>\n<when>1178660462</when>\n<utime>05/09/07 12:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
