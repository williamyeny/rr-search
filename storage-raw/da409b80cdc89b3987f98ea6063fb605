Just because the outside glass is cool enough to touch does not mean the substrate is cool enough to inoculate. Just be careful and think about where your precious baby spores are going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:facepalm:&quot; title=&quot;:facepalm:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't describe how reading that ridiculous nonsense makes me feel.&amp;nbsp; If the jar is cool on the outside, IT IS COOL ON THE INSIDE.&amp;nbsp; For crying out loud, these are half pint jars.&amp;nbsp; Tell me when was the last time you picked up a cold cup of coffee and then scalded your lips taking a drink???&amp;nbsp; Please think about things like this.&amp;nbsp; There is no way a tiny jar of moist substrate is going to be hot on the inside and cool on the outside.&amp;nbsp; Water is an excellent heat conductor.&amp;nbsp; It is NOT an insulator.&amp;nbsp; Some moron wrote this &quot;cool on the outside, hot on the inside&quot; crap years ago and for some reason, noobs keep right on repeating it as if it made any sense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to be rough, but I've typed exactly the above at least a hundred times over the years, but for some reason people keep repeating that horrible BS that isn't based on reality or science in any way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12708069</next>\n<prev>12708012</prev>\n<first>12707722</first>\n<last>12877635</last>\n<when>1276012204</when>\n<utime>06/08/10 06:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
