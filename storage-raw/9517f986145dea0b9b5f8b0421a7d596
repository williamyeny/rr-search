Also, you want near 100% humidity from the primordia forming stage all the way through harvest.  High humidity and massive amounts of air exchange are the key to success with mushroom growing.  You don't get that in a tub with polyfill or tyvek over the holes.  There is no need or reason to filter air in a fruiting chamber.  Air exchange is the way to prevent contaminants because they thrive in stale, still air, while mushroom mycelium thrives in moving fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of air exchange means you'll need to mist to make up for the lost moisture. That's the nature of the beast.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7083008</next>\n<prev>7082912</prev>\n<first>7082701</first>\n<last>7095728</last>\n<when>1182611372</when>\n<utime>06/23/07 06:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
