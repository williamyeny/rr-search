However, if you want the best pinset and growth you can get, then use bright light with a color temperature of 5,000 Kelvin to 7500 Kelvin.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there's other parameters that are just as important, if not more important than light. Failure to pay attention to ALL the pinning triggers is like trying to win the Indy 500 with a clogged up air filter or dirty spark plugs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7744346</next>\n<prev>7744196</prev>\n<first>7743994</first>\n<last>7751018</last>\n<when>1197390955</when>\n<utime>12/11/07 06:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
