When you pick up a handfull, no water should drip out.  If you squeeze gently, one or two drops will fall.  If you squeeze hard, several drops to a small stream will run out for a second or two, then stop.  Just adjust to that point and it will work well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6651366</next>\n<prev>6651104</prev>\n<first>6651104</first>\n<last>6656217</last>\n<when>1173421673</when>\n<utime>03/09/07 08:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
