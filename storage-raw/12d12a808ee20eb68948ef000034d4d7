They did fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;84F to 86F is not ideal for colonization.  Growth has already begun to slow down by 84F.  Growth is fastest in the 75F to 81F range.  They're far less picky at fruiting time, although I've found the quality of the fruits are better with lower temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7371895</prev>\n<first>7369812</first>\n<last>7372171</last>\n<when>1189043098</when>\n<utime>09/06/07 04:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
