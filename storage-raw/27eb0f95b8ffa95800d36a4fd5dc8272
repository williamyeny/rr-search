The fresh air mixes with the CO2, and the constant circulation clears it out.  I've explained the theory of operation in detail in a few threads.  Basically, you elevate the terrarium above the table it sits on.  Air is drawn into the cool perlite through the holes in the bottom, and the low pressure area above tends to draw the air up through the perlite, humidifying it as it passes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What confuses me though, is that I thought that the shotgun box was an RR-tek. So it's a bit contradicting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, but I don't put my name on teks.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7459046</next>\n<prev>7458889</prev>\n<first>7457205</first>\n<last>7460262</last>\n<when>1190896472</when>\n<utime>09/27/07 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
