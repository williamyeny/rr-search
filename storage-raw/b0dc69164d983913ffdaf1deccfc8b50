When you use a blower to pressurize a space, the pressure is equal over the entire space.  For example, if you blow up a baloon, the pressure within the baloon is equal at all points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a flowhood to acheive laminar flow, the blower must pressurize a plenum that is located immediately between the blower and the filter. Due to the fact that air is a fluid, the pressure will be equal at all points within the plenum, or pressurized space.  This means the pressure is equal over the entire back surface of the filter, resulting in even airflow(laminar) thru the filter to the front surface.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no area that is weaker than any other area.  The edges flow just as well as the center, and there is no suction anywhere within a flowhood.  It works on pressure.  The air DOES need to be diffused if the output is blowing right on the filter.  I recommend installing a blower so the airflow is not directed right onto the filter, but rather parallel to it.  My blower is installed on top of the flowhood so the air blows vertically down into the plenum, rather than horizontally, directly at the filter.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5628183</next>\n<prev>5627251</prev>\n<first>5625273</first>\n<last>5629656</last>\n<when>1147615655</when>\n<utime>05/14/06 05:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
