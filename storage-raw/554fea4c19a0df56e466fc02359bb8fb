If you save them for a few days before using, be sure to pasteurize at 140 to 160F for an hour before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use spent grinds from the coffee pot, not freshly ground beans.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6318741</next>\n<prev>6317901</prev>\n<first>6317901</first>\n<last>6319388</last>\n<when>1164828669</when>\n<utime>11/29/06 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
