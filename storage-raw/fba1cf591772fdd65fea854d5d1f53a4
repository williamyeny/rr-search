I only got about 2 flushes out of each, and they were decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80% of the potential harvest will come from the first two flushes.&amp;nbsp; Astute growers will time their spawn generation to get two flushes, and then have fresh cakes/substrates to replace the previous ones, which will be buried in the garden area to do their thing and flush again outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use spent cakes to inoculate bulk, other than outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>12827530</prev>\n<first>12827001</first>\n<last>12827725</last>\n<when>1277909843</when>\n<utime>06/30/10 05:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
