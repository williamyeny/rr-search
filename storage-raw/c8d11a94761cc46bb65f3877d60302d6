So I guess I'll be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light has no effect on colonizing jars, either good or bad.  You don't need to worry about blocking light until you put then in the tray and add your casing layer.  At that point, cover with foil until it's time to introduce to fruiting conditions.  That is when you'll put them on a lighting schedule.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6903339</next>\n<prev>6902886</prev>\n<first>6901823</first>\n<last>6903546</last>\n<when>1178927726</when>\n<utime>05/12/07 02:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
