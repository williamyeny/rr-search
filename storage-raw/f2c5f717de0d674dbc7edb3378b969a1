If you made a cake from plain rye, I doubt it will ever fruit.  Grains need a casing layer to perform well, or they need to be spawned to manure or some other bulk substrate.  BRF-verm is one of the few that will perform well on its own in cake form.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6504802</prev>\n<first>6502623</first>\n<last>6505027</last>\n<when>1170017242</when>\n<utime>01/28/07 10:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
