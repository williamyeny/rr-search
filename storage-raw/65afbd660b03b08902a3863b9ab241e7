There are no &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; 'strains' going around legally because by definition, spores on a print are not strains.&amp;nbsp; Strains are a pairing of compatible hyphae, and are kept in culture form, not spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15260905</next>\n<prev>15260823</prev>\n<first>15260414</first>\n<last>15523749</last>\n<when>1319293045</when>\n<utime>10/22/11 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
