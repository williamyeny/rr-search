Once you understand the process, experiment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your project will run out of air, contaminate due to lack of proper sterilization, and have little to nothing of substance to fruit on.  Perlite spawn 'can' be used to inoculate other substrates, but not as a fruiting substrate itself.  All of this has been tried and written about on these pages.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6553616</prev>\n<first>6553286</first>\n<last>6553625</last>\n<when>1171213232</when>\n<utime>02/11/07 07:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
