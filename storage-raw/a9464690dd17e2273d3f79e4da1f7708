For every one that works, three or four don't, and you've wasted all that time.  Simply inject spores into your cakes, and if you want more product, spawn the cakes to manure or straw.  Make prints from your next harvest, and you can easily make your own spore syringes, re-using your old syringes by boiling them in water for an hour to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7999533</next>\n<prev>7999353</prev>\n<first>7999336</first>\n<last>8046646</last>\n<when>1202570926</when>\n<utime>02/09/08 05:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
