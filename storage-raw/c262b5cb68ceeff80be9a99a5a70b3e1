You should be able to let the PC cool overnight to room temperature, then have the grains completely loose in the jar with no shaking.  Just turning a jar upside down should be enough to separate the kernels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not, you need to rinse the grains before preparing, and add gypsum when placing in the jars.  Make sure the grains are dry on the outside(surface) when you load your jars.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6043572</next>\n<prev>6042436</prev>\n<first>5265629</first>\n<last>26689750</last>\n<when>1157771472</when>\n<utime>09/09/06 06:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
