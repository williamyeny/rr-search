Foil is no filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read up on filtered gas exchange.&amp;nbsp; You can use dry verm if it's a brf jar, or tyvek, polyfill, synthetic filter disks, or even micropore tape if a grain jar.&amp;nbsp; The pore size of whatever you used for a filter needs to be smaller than the smallest contaminant particle floating in the air.&amp;nbsp; My favorite is synthetic filter disks because they're made from PFTE and can be used over and over again hundreds of times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9028760</next>\n<prev>9028664</prev>\n<first>9027117</first>\n<last>9028822</last>\n<when>1223149690</when>\n<utime>10/04/08 10:48 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
