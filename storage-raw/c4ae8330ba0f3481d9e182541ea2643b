As long as a large portion on the tote is clear to let light it, it should be good to use. I would rather by a clear tub with a solid colored lid, then mess around with cutting a hole and replacing it with plexiglass. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's some very bad advice in this thread.&amp;nbsp; Light is an important pinning trigger, and if you're using a colored terrarium with a clear lid, you've just blocked out 80% of the light.&amp;nbsp; More light enters a terrarium from the sides than top.&amp;nbsp; Best is a clear tub with a clear lid.&amp;nbsp; Second best is a clear tub with a white lid so the lid reflects light down.&amp;nbsp; Don't use opaque tubs.&amp;nbsp; Members who do often post asking why they have such crappy pinsets and small, undeveloped fruits with tiny caps.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11782502</next>\n<prev>11781903</prev>\n<first>11780959</first>\n<last>11817785</last>\n<when>1262885497</when>\n<utime>01/07/10 07:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
