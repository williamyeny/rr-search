They throw too much moisture to be absorbed by the air in that amount of time.  Get a cycle timer and run it 1 minute on, two to five minutes off and you'll be able to get the high humidity you want without drips everywhere.  In the meantime, lay wax paper over the top of your trays to catch the drips, then just drain it a few times per day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6690907</next>\n<prev>6690722</prev>\n<first>6690569</first>\n<last>6690907</last>\n<when>1174401215</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 05:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
