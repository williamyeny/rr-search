Make certain not to start your timer until steam is escaping from under the lid of the pot, and steam for 90 minutes after that time.&amp;nbsp; A common mistake is to start timing when the water boils, and this is incorrect procedure. In fact, I'd call this a trial run, and make up a fresh batch when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10107936</prev>\n<first>10107242</first>\n<last>10109236</last>\n<when>1238938912</when>\n<utime>04/05/09 04:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
