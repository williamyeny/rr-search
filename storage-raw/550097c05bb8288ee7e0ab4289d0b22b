The tryptamine/phan threads have been around for a long time, so of course I also included a few substrate materials high in those, such as seaweed.  Then, N became the all important nutrient.  I tried horse manure, chicken manure, cow manure, worm castings, etc., and the results were always the same.  Extremely potent mushrooms came from good isolates whether it was on plain straw, or horse manure or compost.  It didn't matter if coffee was added, or worm castings, anything. At the same time, performance from multispore inoculations were all over the scale every grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've honestly never found a substrate additive that increases potency.  If one is out there, it's yet to be found.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5855647</next>\n<prev>5854980</prev>\n<first>5852832</first>\n<last>5860506</last>\n<when>1152826362</when>\n<utime>07/14/06 12:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
