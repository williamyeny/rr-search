You want to have the maximum amount of air exchange you can get while still maintaining high humidity.  There is no need to filter the holes.  Just leave them open.  I'd still fan a couple of times a day using the terrarium lid as a fan.  You can't get too much fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6456974</next>\n<prev>6456806</prev>\n<first>6453597</first>\n<last>6460528</last>\n<when>1168750625</when>\n<utime>01/14/07 06:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
