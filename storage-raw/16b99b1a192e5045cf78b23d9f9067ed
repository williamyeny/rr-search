'Sterilization' is a relative term in this business and never complete.  Make up a fresh batch of jars when you get your spores.  Jars already made will let you test your procedure, and if they go green or get smelly, you know next time to do things differently.  However, don't inoculate them.  For best results, always use fresh substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5939360</next>\n<prev>5938635</prev>\n<first>5938498</first>\n<last>5940415</last>\n<when>1154929376</when>\n<utime>08/07/06 08:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
