Mushroom mycelium eats its food.  That's why substrates get smaller over time. Regardless of the name on the 'strain', they'll mix fine in the same substrate.  It's no different from multispore inoculation, which is what you probably started with.  I've done it dozens or more times, as have many growers here.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7498796</next>\n<prev>7498497</prev>\n<first>7498421</first>\n<last>7499044</last>\n<when>1191885934</when>\n<utime>10/09/07 02:25 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
