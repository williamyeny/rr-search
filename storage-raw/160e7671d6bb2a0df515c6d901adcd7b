That's probably what's slowing down growth and causing problems.  Colonize at &lt;i&gt;normal room temperature&lt;/i&gt; and they'll be finished by day 20.  Too many so-called 'teks' around here recommend 'incubating' for some silly reason, probably that incorrect figure of '86F is best for colonization' reported in a book from 20+ years ago.  Incubating makes about as much sense as 'total darkness', and 'dropping humidity after pins form'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8443256</next>\n<prev>8443238</prev>\n<first>8443230</first>\n<last>8444295</last>\n<when>1211734574</when>\n<utime>05/25/08 07:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
