They're antibiotic compounds to help the organism fight off contaminants, and also to help break down the substrate.  They're the same stuff that penicillin is made from, when metabolites from the penicillium mold are extracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrrect, they won't make it stink and won't cause a problem.  In fact, they help to solve problems.  If you have a lot of metabolites, it indicates possible contaminants in the substrate and/or excess temperatures, leading to too much bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7077521</next>\n<prev>7072258</prev>\n<first>7072152</first>\n<last>7077521</last>\n<when>1182483959</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 06:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
