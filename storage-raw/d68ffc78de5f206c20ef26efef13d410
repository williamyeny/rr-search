I live in a mild climate and make no attempt to heat or AC my house.  In the summer, the ambient temperature indoors sometimes shoots up to 90F, and in the winter, the grow area can drop to 65F, but the fruits keep coming, regardless.  Just keep your fruiting chamber near normal room temperatures and you'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6369084</prev>\n<first>6369020</first>\n<last>6369304</last>\n<when>1166104360</when>\n<utime>12/14/06 03:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
