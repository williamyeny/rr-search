{"key":"post-5663267","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5663267</id>\n<content>I've tried a gazillion substrates and strains and species and my conclusion is there's a lot we can do to screw things up, but not a hell of a lot we can do to increase potency.  Here's an analogy.  Is there a food you can eat that will make you smarter?   If so will it make you twice as smart?   How about a food that will double your vision? Hearing?   How about a food that will make a long distance runner twice as fast?   Sorry, but it ain't gonna happen with us, and it ain't gonna happen with mushrooms.   Just give them what they want, and let nature do her work.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5663587</next>\n<prev>5662415</prev>\n<first>5662313</first>\n<last>5663587</last>\n<when>1148393538</when>\n<utime>05/23/06 05:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
