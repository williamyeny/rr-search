However, it's designed to increase CO2, and remove humidity.  Note that it says it has a DEhumidifing humidistat for some reason, which is doubtfully programmed to function at 95% anyway, or you could simply use it to power a normally closed relay.  Perhaps it works both ways, even though what you quoted didn't say so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7951214</next>\n<prev>7951042</prev>\n<first>7950878</first>\n<last>7953250</last>\n<when>1201647810</when>\n<utime>01/30/08 01:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
