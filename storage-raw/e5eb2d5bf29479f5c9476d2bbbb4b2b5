Is that uncased manure?  I'd suggest gently dabbing the excessive off with a clean dry paper towel. The metabolites help to fight infections, but too much of a good thing isn't always good.  Dry it off, and increase air exchange.  You want high humidity, especially if fruiting uncased, but you also want lots of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6966586</next>\n<prev>6966525</prev>\n<first>6965831</first>\n<last>6983850</last>\n<when>1180136443</when>\n<utime>05/26/07 02:40 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
