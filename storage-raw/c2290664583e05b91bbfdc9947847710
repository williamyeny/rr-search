Don't allow your cakes or other substrate to dry out.  Mist a few times per day.  If your cakes are blue and you haven't touched them, try picking one up, and by the weight you can judge moisture content.  If it's light, dunk again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have three to five inches of rinsed, then well drained perlite.  Such should give upper ninety percent humidity, with good air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7354391</next>\n<prev>7350823</prev>\n<first>7350316</first>\n<last>17459471</last>\n<when>1188477739</when>\n<utime>08/30/07 03:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
