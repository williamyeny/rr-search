Try using gypsum at ten percent the amount of peat, and hydrated lime at one teaspoon per cup of peat.  That should get you in the ballpark, where you can check and adjust final pH as needed.  Shoot for pH 8.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7859468</next>\n<prev>7859435</prev>\n<first>7859419</first>\n<last>7864589</last>\n<when>1199996335</when>\n<utime>01/10/08 10:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
