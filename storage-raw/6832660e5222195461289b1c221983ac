That is a mold smell.  It's very distinct and once you smell fresh mushroom spawn, you'll never forget.  It smells like fresh mushrooms.  If your broken up cake smells like anything else, it's bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second picture you just posted also looks like mold.  It sounds like you have a problem with inoculation.  Either contaminated spore solution or improper sterile technique during the inoculation process.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6515829</next>\n<prev>6515096</prev>\n<first>6496369</first>\n<last>6535020</last>\n<when>1170260304</when>\n<utime>01/31/07 06:18 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
