Longer logs do much better. (bigger substrate=bigger fruit bodies)  Lots of folks over at Mycotopia are starting logs now.  In 2-3 weeks you should be hearing from them.  They pin in 2 weeks, and the flush is over in 3 weeks.  Take the leftover log out to your garden and use it to mulch your veggies.  The leftover myc will help your garden, and you should get a few really big mushies in the fall.  The tek(with pictures) is posted there in the 'fungi' section. </content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>1472067</next>\n<prev>1472053</prev>\n<first>1471309</first>\n<last>1473070</last>\n<when>1050730256</when>\n<utime>04/19/03 08:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
