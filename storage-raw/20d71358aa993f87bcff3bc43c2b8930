You'd be better off in a tray.  Don't force the mycelium to colonize the perlite that has no food for it anyway. It will waste needless energy.  Either crumble into a tray and case, or crumble into three times as much coir or manure, but not perlite.  Perlite is for helping to humidify a terrarium, not for use as a substrate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6762701</next>\n<prev>6760831</prev>\n<first>6758166</first>\n<last>13499961</last>\n<when>1176055269</when>\n<utime>04/08/07 09:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
