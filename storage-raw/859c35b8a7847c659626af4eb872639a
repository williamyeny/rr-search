It helps to prevents your breath and other floating particulates from contaminating your project.  You don't need to wipe a needle down after flame sterilizing.  A red hot needle is already as clean as it can get.  Wiping it down with anything compromises that.   Wear a hairnet, gloves, and surgical mask.  It's impossible to get 'too sterile'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6278053</prev>\n<first>6278032</first>\n<last>6278209</last>\n<when>1163434267</when>\n<utime>11/13/06 06:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
