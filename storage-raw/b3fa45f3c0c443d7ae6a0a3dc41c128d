Hydrated lime is calcium carbonate(crushed limestone) that has been heated in a kiln.  The result in brief, is that it becomes water soluable so it goes to work right away, making it my personal choice for pH contol.  If you use limestone, oyster shell flour, or calcium carbonate, there is a lag time before the lime raises the pH. You'll want to pH balance your casing material to a pH of around 8 to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't speak for why someone made a mistake on their website, other than stuff happens like that in any technical field.  In addition, my experience isn't the last word on any subject.  I have however, sent them a pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of gypsum you'll use, and the fact that it's heavy and expensive to ship, I'd suggest a local nursery.  I've never yet been to one that doesn't carry it.  I get 25 lb bags of horticultural grade gypsum right up the street for just over $3.  If you can't find it locally, and don't want to smash up a sheet of drywall(sheetrock) order your gypsum from a vendor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7715402</next>\n<prev>7715317</prev>\n<first>7715228</first>\n<last>11861962</last>\n<when>1196799134</when>\n<utime>12/04/07 10:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
