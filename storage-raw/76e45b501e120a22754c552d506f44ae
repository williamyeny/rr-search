Potency issues are not really appropriate in my opinion when a few grams does the job anyway.  If you're not high enough, simply eat a bit more.  Dunking is a long time proved process to put moisture back into the substrate. Dunking before first flush is optional, but it's best to dunk between flushes for sure. There is no reason to use mineral water.  I use plain tap water, but if your local water supply sucks, it's probably best to filter it or use spring water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5767559</prev>\n<first>5767529</first>\n<last>5768701</last>\n<when>1150756199</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 01:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
