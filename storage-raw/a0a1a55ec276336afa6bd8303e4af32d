If the mycelium melts and disappears, it was cobweb.  Don't worry if you need to get the casing layer completely wet with it, because it breaks down fast.  The mushroom mycelium doesn't like peroxide, but it likes a cobweb attack even less.  Spray three times per day if you have to.  Kill that stuff.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5726967</next>\n<prev>5724906</prev>\n<first>5723788</first>\n<last>5728540</last>\n<when>1149741102</when>\n<utime>06/08/06 07:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
