You make the agar in a bottle, then pour it into the sterile dishes.  Plastic petri dishes are not PC'able.  If you pour the agar while it's hot, as it cools, it will draw in contaminants unless you're in a sterile room.  Wait for it to cool almost to room temperature, then pour the plates and carefully slip them right back into the plastic tube they came out of.   That will protect them until you inoculate and wrap with parafilm.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6540384</prev>\n<first>6540328</first>\n<last>6541043</last>\n<when>1170890458</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 01:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
