If you put the filter disk on later, that might be the vector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Latex gloves should be washed with 70% alcohol once you  put them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dust mask will not stop bacteria leaving your mouth.  Get a medical mask from a health supply store.  It will be labeled, &quot;stops 99% of the wearers exhaled bacteria&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lysol will do very little to clean the air in a room.  Lysol is a surface disinfectant.  Use Oust or 10% bleach in a misting bottle to spray the air.  You should still be using a glove box so you work with no air currents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That temperature is too high.  80F should be considered the maximum incubation temperature.  Due to thermogenesis, the temperature inside the jar is several degrees warmer than outside.  Glass is also an insulator, further raising the temperature within.  Higher temperatures favor molds, lower temperatures favor mushroom mycelium.  Personally, I incubate on an open shelf at normal room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needle needs to be flame sterilized between each jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What grain was used, and how did you protect it during inoculation? I suspect the grains became contaminated before the filter disks went on.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4840264</next>\n<prev>4839061</prev>\n<first>4839061</first>\n<last>4892645</last>\n<when>1130044163</when>\n<utime>10/23/05 08:09 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
