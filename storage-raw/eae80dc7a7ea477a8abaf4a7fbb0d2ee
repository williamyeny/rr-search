Its about trich and I dont feel like making another post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one jar out of 45 that has shown a small green/bluish dot about 2cm in diameter. I took it away from the rest of my jars because im about 99% sure thats a contam. Is their any harm in letting it grow though? I wana see how this contam works, how quick it is, just study it a bit so I understand how they act a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this risky? Its still inside the jar, sealed up with a dry verm barrier. Its at the innoc point, so apparently it somehow got in when I inoculated (though its near the bottom of the jar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im just glad its one jar and not more, atleast for now &amp;gt;.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S sorry for the thread jack, if you want me to delete my post just ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to study it then sure go a head its no prob. One tip thoe elastic band a coffee filter or 2 over the top of the jar. It will be contained and safe to study &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way.&amp;nbsp; Toss it.&amp;nbsp; Trying to stop contaminant spores with coffee filters is like trying to stop a mosquito with a chain link fence.&amp;nbsp; Even with the best synthetic filter disks, I've accidentally missed contaminated jars, and all the surrounding jars come down with trich too.&amp;nbsp; Filters might stop 99.99% of the contaminant spores, but .001% of a few billion is a lot of spores to have floating around.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11979664</next>\n<prev>11979624</prev>\n<first>11979291</first>\n<last>11979714</last>\n<when>1265531193</when>\n<utime>02/07/10 10:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
