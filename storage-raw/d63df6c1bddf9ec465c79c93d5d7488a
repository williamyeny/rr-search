You definitely DO need SOME kind of filter for ANY grain jars. Be it tyvek, micropore, polyfill or filter discs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt; thats bullshit,Ive done hundreds of wbs jars with nothing more that a few holes in the lid and a piece of foil over top and Ive never had a single contam as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been doing this long enough to know better.&amp;nbsp; Grain jars need to be filtered.&amp;nbsp; Foil isn't a filter.&amp;nbsp; Nobody does that for long before it catches up on them.&amp;nbsp; Most only try it the first grow, and then when they see white, they think it was a success. Of course, they never come back a week later to report it all went green overnight.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>9923465</prev>\n<first>9917710</first>\n<last>9923861</last>\n<when>1236380373</when>\n<utime>03/07/09 12:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
