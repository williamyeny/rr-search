The two biggest uses of gypsum are to supply calcium and sulphur which are necessary for good fruitbody development, and ph buffering.  Sulphur is sour and calcium is sweet.  Between them, they keep the ph from swinging as much during the cropping cycle. You still need to lime to balance the ph. The ability to prevent grains from clumping in a jar is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5747735</next>\n<prev>5747712</prev>\n<first>5747304</first>\n<last>5748146</last>\n<when>1150260178</when>\n<utime>06/14/06 07:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
