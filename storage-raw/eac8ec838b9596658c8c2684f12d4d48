The reason you lost all the water in the jar is because the water was at 250F.  The only way water can stay liquid at that temperature is to be under pressure of 15 psi.  When you released the pressure, you also released all the water in your jar into vapor.  People also do this all the time when they PC brf jars, then complain their substrate is too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always let the PC cool on its own without disturbing it until ten minutes or so after the last of the pressure has naturally subsided.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5159864</next>\n<prev>5159459</prev>\n<first>5157996</first>\n<last>5160695</last>\n<when>1136860710</when>\n<utime>01/10/06 04:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
