In fact, I can't believe I actually typed 'shroom' above.&amp;nbsp; Gawd, I hate that word.&amp;nbsp; I think that's the first time I've ever actually typed it unless I was bitching at someone for using it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:lol:&quot; title=&quot;:lol:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8513392</next>\n<prev>8513336</prev>\n<first>8512232</first>\n<last>8513392</last>\n<when>1213245970</when>\n<utime>06/12/08 07:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
