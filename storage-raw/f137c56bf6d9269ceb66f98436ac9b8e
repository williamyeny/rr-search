In addition, every commercial agaricus farm I know of uses gypsum in their substrates.  Gypsum is not used to change pH.  That's the job of lime to raise pH or sulfur to lower it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gypsum contains both calcium carbonate and sulfur, thus it tends to keep the pH near neutral, preventing swings as the metabolites try to push the pH down.   We add lime to make the casing layer inhospitable to competitor fungi which are less tolerant of a high pH than established mushroom mycelium.  Calcium carbonate or hydrated lime is not used to counter the effect of the metabolites.  As said above, that's what the gypsum does.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use gypsum on substrates such as compost or horse manure, but don't use lime.  Save the lime for the casing mix, where you should use gypsum and lime together.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7620080</next>\n<prev>7618803</prev>\n<first>7618803</first>\n<last>7713320</last>\n<when>1194747873</when>\n<utime>11/11/07 04:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
