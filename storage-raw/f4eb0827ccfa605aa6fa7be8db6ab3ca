Wear latex gloves.  This will give you freedom of movement, and the much cooler agar will prevent condensation on your petri dishes as well as the sides of your glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a whiskey or other liquor bottle to prepare the agar as it's easy to pour from.  The longer the neck the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divide your sleeve of 20 dishes into two stacks of ten.  On the first pour, lift the top nine dishes and all ten lids with your left hand and pour the bottom dish with your right, assuming you're right handed. Next, lift the top eight dishes and nine lids and pour the second dish, etc., until the stack is poured, and then pour the second stack.  Leave them in two stacks of ten until solidified.  When you pull your hands out of the holes, have something ready to stuff them with to prevent drafts, or cover with paper taped into place, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dishes solidify, place back into the plastic sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6778340</next>\n<prev>6778106</prev>\n<first>6778106</first>\n<last>6778939</last>\n<when>1176387127</when>\n<utime>04/12/07 05:12 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
