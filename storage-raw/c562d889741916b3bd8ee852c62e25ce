That's 0.05 Seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is complete bullshit, and I've said so many times.  Just because something is in a book, does not make it true.  TMC is also wrong about 86F being the best temperature for cubensis growth.  The truth is that growth falls off very rapidly at 83F and above.  I've tested that many times in controlled conditions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6831953</next>\n<prev>6830823</prev>\n<first>6828671</first>\n<last>6833704</last>\n<when>1177517498</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 07:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
