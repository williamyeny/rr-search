Chances are, if the swab test was negative, it's not mold, but watch it for sure. I agree it doesn't really look the color of mold.  In addition, mold will be a separate layer on the surface, as if you poured green sand on top.  Bruising will be the color of the substrate itself. Hopefully,  you'll get a nice flush and that will hold you over until you can get some more spores and get a fresh start.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6714413</next>\n<prev>6709440</prev>\n<first>6706512</first>\n<last>6714413</last>\n<when>1174862352</when>\n<utime>03/26/07 01:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
