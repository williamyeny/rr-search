Coir is as nutritious as straw or manure, so it makes a very poor choice for a casing layer.  Overlay is common.  Essentially what happens if you use coir on top is you have two substrate layers and no casing layer.  Poor performance is the result.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5179909</next>\n<prev>5179860</prev>\n<first>5179709</first>\n<last>5300488</last>\n<when>1137264055</when>\n<utime>01/14/06 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
