{"key":"post-6438537","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6438537</id>\n<content>One hour is too long to run the humidifier.  More than a few minutes at a time will cause drips to form.  I run mine less than five minutes on, followed by five to ten minutes off.  This maintains a high humidity without excessive dripping.  You need to seal the bottom and put several trays of perlite down there to catch whatever drips do form.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, get a timer with 15 minute intervals.  They're cheap.  Try running 15 on, 30 off.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6438539</next>\n<prev>6438520</prev>\n<first>6438435</first>\n<last>6439837</last>\n<when>1168294044</when>\n<utime>01/09/07 12:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
