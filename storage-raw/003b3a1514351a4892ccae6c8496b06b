They were quite light in my hand. I handled them as little as possible to avoid bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said before, too wet or too dry both give small fruits.&amp;nbsp; The easiest way to tell which is wrong is to lift the cakes as you've now found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry about the loose fitting lid.&amp;nbsp; More air is better, especially when it's escaping from the top as it should.&amp;nbsp; You just mist to make up for it.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the humidity inside the tub is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; The humidity that matters is right against the fruiting surface of the substrate.&amp;nbsp; If you mist regularly, that stays near 100%.&amp;nbsp; The idea is to get the surface damp, and then to have it dry out somewhat before next misting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lift the cakes mid-flush and if they're light, you can always set them in a saucer of water overnight.&amp;nbsp; Don't allow fruits to grow after the veil starts tearing unless it's for prints.&amp;nbsp; Food and &lt;i&gt;other qualities&lt;/i&gt; we desire begin to degrade rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19530003</next>\n<prev>19529598</prev>\n<first>19480103</first>\n<last>19572878</last>\n<when>1391703889</when>\n<utime>02/06/14 06:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
