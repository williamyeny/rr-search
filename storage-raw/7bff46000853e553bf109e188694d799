Bacteria in manageable quantities are not a contaminant in bulk growing, but molds are.  A sterilized substrate is a prime breeding ground for whatever lands on it, thus if you sterilize bulk substrates, you'll have a higher rate of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7335653</next>\n<prev>7335482</prev>\n<first>7334795</first>\n<last>7340685</last>\n<when>1188139447</when>\n<utime>08/26/07 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
