(empty of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, glass petri dishes are a royal pain in the ass.  They're too heavy to work with.  I dropped so many and lost cultures, I finally got pissed and tossed them all out.  Also, you can buy plastic pre-sterilized petri dishes for five cents each, and I doubt you can wash and sterilize a glass one for that.  You can get a box of 500 petri dishes for $40 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cenmed.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onmouseover=&quot;javascript:mm_toggle('contextLink')&quot; onmouseout=&quot;javascript:mm_toggle()&quot;&gt;www.cenmed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4512258</next>\n<prev>4511764</prev>\n<first>4511616</first>\n<last>23015760</last>\n<when>1123558968</when>\n<utime>08/09/05 06:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
