If you folks don't know an answer, don't make one up.  Let someone else help out.  These silly myths get spread from hearing something over and over again until people think it's true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you get an infection, go tell your friggen doctor you want a shot of mold piss.  The liquid metabolites are antibiotic compounds used to fight bacteria and other competitors.  When the penicillium mold produces them, they're made into penicillin shots.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6632769</next>\n<prev>6632473</prev>\n<first>6631466</first>\n<last>6633737</last>\n<when>1172985806</when>\n<utime>03/04/07 07:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
