But I started thinking about it and came to the conclusion that most noobs are lazy and want the info handed to them instead of putting in a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreed.&amp;nbsp; Like everything, advice must be taken with a grain of salt.&amp;nbsp; The trusted cultivator tag indicates that person is a proved, experienced user, but there's also lots of good advice out there by others as well.&amp;nbsp; As the site grows, it's important that new users learn to use the search function, so we don't have pages and pages of the same repetitive questions over and over again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens, is a question has been answered so many times, the experienced users simply ignore it, and then wrong answers are given by noobs to other noobs, and hundreds of new members read that bad info and act on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said, click on the link at the top of the page to 'user list' and then click 'Advanced User Search', then click the box for trusted cultivators and you'll get the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9104466</next>\n<prev>9104348</prev>\n<first>9104005</first>\n<last>16700687</last>\n<when>1224532652</when>\n<utime>10/20/08 10:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
