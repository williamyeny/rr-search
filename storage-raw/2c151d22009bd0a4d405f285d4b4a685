Fortunately, I tried a small scale grow with one of the cigars first, before destroying the whole $500 box of cubans.   The mycelium wouldn't touch the cigar.  I dropped half of a sterilized and hydrated cigar into a jar of colonized rye berries, and the mycelium wouldn't jump on to the cigar at all, so I cancelled that grow and just smoked the cubans, which was kind of weird too, since I don't smoke.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6932115</next>\n<prev>6931225</prev>\n<first>6930025</first>\n<last>6932513</last>\n<when>1179458253</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 06:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
