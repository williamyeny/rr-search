I walk that mile, pulling the product in a wagon behind me to meet the mailman every day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my whole career living in cities, this was a welcome change.&amp;nbsp; I now wouldn't trade the hard physical work for all the fancy cars and electronic gizmos I used to have, if it meant going back to the city with all the crime, smog, traffic, assholes, etc., that I used to have to deal with daily.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12677992</next>\n<prev>12677854</prev>\n<first>12672191</first>\n<last>12690264</last>\n<when>1275583663</when>\n<utime>06/03/10 07:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
