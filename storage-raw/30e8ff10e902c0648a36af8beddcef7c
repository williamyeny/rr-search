Sterility is not important either as you don't dump your spawn out on the floor of the glovebox.  Just cut a couple of arm holes in your container, and either glue gloves or tyvek sleeves in place.  Soap and water is sufficient to clean a glovebox.  Don't use alcohol or lysol if you plan to use an alcohol flame to sterilize your needles/scalpel.  Just before making transfers, it helps to spray a few squirts with a fine mister(water only) as the mist will settle any contaminants that may be airborne inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4507716</next>\n<prev>4507614</prev>\n<first>4507565</first>\n<last>4509725</last>\n<when>1123455277</when>\n<utime>08/08/05 01:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
