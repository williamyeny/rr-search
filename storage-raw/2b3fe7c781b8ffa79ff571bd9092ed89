Mushrooms aren't plants. Mushrooms aren't converting light into energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Says who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's pretty damned obvious that mycelium is converting light into some other form of energy that is useful to it.&amp;nbsp; Mushrooms grown with proper lighting pin more prolifically, grow fatter and meatier with considerably more finish weight, and are more vigorous and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's worthless to compare mushrooms to plants.&amp;nbsp; Mycelium is as different from plants as we are.&amp;nbsp; The absence of photosynthesis doesn't mean the mycelium isn't deriving energy from the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer the original poster, you'll get mushrooms from the HPS.&amp;nbsp; It will make up somewhat in intensity what it lacks in proper spectrum.&amp;nbsp; I've had excellent results with a 400 watt MH which was already running in the room anyway.&amp;nbsp; MH is around 4,000 Kelvin,&amp;nbsp; which is closer to what we're looking for than an HPS which tends to run around 2700 Kelvin.&amp;nbsp; As said above, unless you're already running the HPS for something else, get a fluorescent fixture and save the HPS for another day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11620985</next>\n<prev>11279283</prev>\n<first>11278152</first>\n<last>11624130</last>\n<when>1256001061</when>\n<utime>10/20/09 04:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
