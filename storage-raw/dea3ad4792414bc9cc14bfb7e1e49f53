Even with a lot of holes, I'll bet you're creating a flood.  I doubt it needs to run more than a minute or two each time, then shut off for five or ten minutes.  You can use perlite in the tray the humidifier is sitting in to catch the drips and return them to the air as humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7882418</next>\n<prev>7882309</prev>\n<first>7882309</first>\n<last>7882418</last>\n<when>1200415121</when>\n<utime>01/15/08 06:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
