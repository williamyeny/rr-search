It doesn't get your answers any sooner because most of us who answer the questions only pop in once or twice a day.  I try to read all new posts each time.  It doesn't matter if it's on page one or page five.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've posted a lot about outdoor grows.  Do a few searches.  Each summer, I always take a few jars of spawn to the local botanical gardens.  I've posted fruitings from these park grows a few times, so they should be easy to find.  They're in my gallery if you don't find them through a search.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6489509</next>\n<prev>6489432</prev>\n<first>6485451</first>\n<last>6489509</last>\n<when>1169583993</when>\n<utime>01/23/07 10:26 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
