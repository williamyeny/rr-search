The Administration knows, the whole community should know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You did say 'blatantly' and you did say 'you DO(capital letters are yours) know it happens'.  Now, you're trying to backpeddle.  Either you were bullshitting or you will say exactly WHO got ripped off for $500 from a sponsor.
