I know of no beneficial microbes which survive sterilization, nor do I know of any beneficial microbes useful to cubensis.&amp;nbsp; The beneficial microbes in a substrate help to prevent molds, which coir is very resistant to in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recommend sterilizing to noobs because it's more prone to contamination, but for people with flowhoods and experience, they can darn sure pull it off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you haven't been a member here long enough to see some of Damion5050s coir grows or LargeDose's coir grows, or many others which are the equal of horse manure, then it would be wise to avoid accusing those of us who have of talking out our ass. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/nono.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:nono:&quot; title=&quot;:nono:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14260502</next>\n<prev>14260385</prev>\n<first>14255995</first>\n<last>15723817</last>\n<when>1302314887</when>\n<utime>04/09/11 05:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
