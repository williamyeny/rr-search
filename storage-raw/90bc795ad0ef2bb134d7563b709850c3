You don't decide which questions are appropriate, the moderating staff does.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majlo, your tray is fully colonized, but will fruit fine.  You're fruiting essentially an uncased bulk substrate because it is impossible to add moisture to the casing layer once it's fully colonized.  Cakes spawned to coir, then cased in peat/verm is a great combo, but horse manure is much cheaper(free) as a substrate than coir.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5633934</next>\n<prev>5632225</prev>\n<first>5583339</first>\n<last>5636832</last>\n<when>1147735572</when>\n<utime>05/16/06 02:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
