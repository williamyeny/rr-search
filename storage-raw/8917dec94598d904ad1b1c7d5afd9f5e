Straw is a good substrate, but being hollow, there isn't much there.  I like at least 6 to 10cm thickness.   In my experience, straw does just as well uncased as cased.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5714128</next>\n<prev>5714119</prev>\n<first>5713948</first>\n<last>5717411</last>\n<when>1149514779</when>\n<utime>06/05/06 04:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
