I've had them go from pins to large mushrooms in three days.  Something else is wrong.  Is your substrate dry?  If so, pour some water to it.  You should be able to lift the tray and get an idea of moisture content by how much it weighs.  If it's light, you can simply pour some water around the edges.  It's hard to get enough moisture to it by misting once you get behind the curve.  Don't go overboard, but get it hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5882635</next>\n<prev>5882494</prev>\n<first>5882467</first>\n<last>5883059</last>\n<when>1153447841</when>\n<utime>07/21/06 05:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
