{"key":"post-5036602","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5036602</id>\n<content>I have three or four large HEPA filters sitting in my storage shed.  They're worthless, imo.  They cause too much turbulence in a room and seem to stir up the contaminants more than they filter them.  I actually have less contaminant trouble without them running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix up a 10% bleach solution and saturate everything in that room.  Walls, ceiling, carpet, bedding, curtains, etc., etc.   Fill the room up with a mist and close all the doors and windows.  Repeat hourly for half a day or so.  The bleach will kill the mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5036623</next>\n<prev>5036508</prev>\n<first>5035801</first>\n<last>5038936</last>\n<when>1134105374</when>\n<utime>12/09/05 07:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
