(if youre sure its contam) do not be skimpy, take the contam, and plenty of substrate touching the contam, away from the healthy myc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very bad advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never attempt to cut contamination away from a substrate.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing so releases billions of spores into the air, making the problem ten times worse for future grows. In addition, the knife spreads the mold into good areas of the cake or tray, compounding the problem further. Toss out contaminated substrates on first sight, placing them in a compost or manure pile outdoors where they may recover and fruit at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14990568</next>\n<prev>14990356</prev>\n<first>14990040</first>\n<last>14999794</last>\n<when>1314548075</when>\n<utime>08/28/11 07:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
