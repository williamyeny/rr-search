There's always a reason why the mycelium stalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER dump dry grains into boiling hot water.  That will burst the kernels quicker than anything else.  Soak the grains in hot tap water for at least a few hours to soften them up.  24 is better.  Bring to a boil, then drain, allow to steam-dry on the surface of the seeds, and load the jars 2/3 full.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7470302</next>\n<prev>7464852</prev>\n<first>7464473</first>\n<last>7470484</last>\n<when>1191019106</when>\n<utime>09/29/07 01:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
