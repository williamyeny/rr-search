Im challenging myself. Before you tell me &quot;just because you can doesnt mean you should&quot; just understand thats its something I want to do. But thank you for the input. If you have any actual design ideas feel free to put it down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.&amp;nbsp; It's a rite of passage for new growers with electronics background to want to combine hobbies.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure you'll go to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt; after you're done though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say that is I'm an electrical and mechanical engineer with 40 years experience in industry, mostly in computerized automation.&amp;nbsp; After playing with automated mini-greenhouses for several years, I developed a love for engineering ways to make nature work all by itself.&amp;nbsp; This led to the shotgun terrarium as well as our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Mountain-Mushroom-Farm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;mom-and-pop mushroom farm&lt;/a&gt; where there are no blowers or humidifiers, automated misters, etc., at all.&amp;nbsp; Air exchange is passive(due to elevated stacks which work like chimneys) similar to a shotgun terrarium where the air exchange creates the humidity, so it all runs without electricity except for the LED lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you're going to find is the transducers don't hold up well in the environment you need them to hold up in.&amp;nbsp; Plus, the first time mushrooms release spores and coat the sensors, they're toast.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17883187</next>\n<prev>17882877</prev>\n<first>17879793</first>\n<last>17948325</last>\n<when>1362110136</when>\n<utime>03/01/13 05:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
