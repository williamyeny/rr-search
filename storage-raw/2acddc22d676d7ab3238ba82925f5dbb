Lay the cow manure out in the sun for a few days so the ammonia can flash off before using.  I would also use five to ten percent gypsum in the compost mix, as well as up to five percent calcium carbonate if you have it, or half a teaspoon of hydrated lime per cup of manure/coir.  The mixture will have a PH of around 5, so you want to add something to buffer it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6053672</prev>\n<first>6053652</first>\n<last>6053720</last>\n<when>1158093864</when>\n<utime>09/12/06 11:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
