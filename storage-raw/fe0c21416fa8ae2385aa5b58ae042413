That is a bunk procedure that only serves to steal moisture from your project and supplies no energy for the grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One to three is a good ratio for spawning to manure.  Keep the substrate to 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick for pans.  They fruit poorly from a thick substrate.  use no more than 1/4&quot; casing layer on them as well.   Cubes do better on a thicker substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold shocking is for cold weather, fall fruiting edibles.  If you cold shock tropcial species, you delay fruiting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6397264</next>\n<prev>6396179</prev>\n<first>6396008</first>\n<last>6397264</last>\n<when>1166801471</when>\n<utime>12/22/06 05:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
