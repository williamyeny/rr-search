Divide 670 by 4 to get feet per minute = 168.&amp;nbsp; That's about right by the time you get a prefilter and account for drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find a blower which will deliver 600 to 700 cfm @ .8 to 1&quot; W.G. and you'll be good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19633823</next>\n<prev>19623076</prev>\n<first>19566863</first>\n<last>19633823</last>\n<when>1393469991</when>\n<utime>02/27/14 04:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
