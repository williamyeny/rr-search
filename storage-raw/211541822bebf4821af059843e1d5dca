If you have it after two days, something was done terribly wrong.  Peroxide right from the bottle will kill cobweb on contact, but you need to find the root cause.  Either the cobweb was already growing on the substrate, or you sterilized the casing material, or some other such mistake was made.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5962325</prev>\n<first>5961916</first>\n<last>5962435</last>\n<when>1155576751</when>\n<utime>08/14/06 08:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
