{"key":"post-8039203","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8039203</id>\n<content>You shouldn't 'incubate' the substrate or the casing(or even the spawn for that matter), but you should allow a week or so for the casing layer to partially colonize before introducing fruiting conditions.  Doing so will result in a fuller, more even flush.  Many growers place the tray into fruiting conditions right after casing, but your flush will be fuller if you wait a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want it fast, coir/coffee fruits very well uncased.  You can simply apply fruiting conditions as soon as the substrate has been colonized for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8039891</next>\n<prev>8039150</prev>\n<first>8038062</first>\n<last>8039891</last>\n<when>1203382442</when>\n<utime>02/19/08 02:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
