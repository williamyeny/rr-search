A little over a week ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is barely enough time to see any growth with the naked eye under the best of conditions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use rye flour, it has to be sterilized in a pressure cooker, not boiled/steamed as per the pf tek.  You also needed to 'almost' double the water.  If you fully double the water for pints, it will be too wet.  The larger the container, the drier you need to make the mix.  I recommend 1/2 pints for brf or rye/verm.  You don't get twice the bang from pint jars, and they take at least twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7689272</next>\n<prev>7688551</prev>\n<first>7687826</first>\n<last>7689272</last>\n<when>1196228301</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 07:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
