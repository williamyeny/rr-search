Since perlite is porous it has a much higher surface area.  A similar sized tray of damp perlite would have a thousand or more times the square inches of surface area exposed to air, thus would evaporate much more water into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said above however, a mono-tub gets humidity from the substrate and generally requires no additional humidification.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8303859</prev>\n<first>8295220</first>\n<last>8303998</last>\n<when>1208622919</when>\n<utime>04/19/08 07:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
