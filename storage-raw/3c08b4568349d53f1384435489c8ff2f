Proper air exchange will correct any temperature differential, but people need to realize that a greenhouse isn't appropriate for pf style cakes because they require a very high humidity.  Cased substrates do very well in the 80% range which should not result in condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know from experience if I allow the cool mists to run for more than two minutes, they begin to drip because the air can't absorb the moisture as fast as one of those can put it out.   However, you can run them one minute on, then two to ten minutes off and get 80 to 90 percent humidity with no drips.  It takes a good cycle timer to do it, but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5776160</next>\n<prev>5775573</prev>\n<first>5773191</first>\n<last>5776958</last>\n<when>1150895031</when>\n<utime>06/21/06 04:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
