The idea of a forum is to share information, not to prove the other guy right or wrong.  That's how we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you tell someone who's been around for many years that his idea is 'awful advice' you're bound to get a reaction.  If you push your luck, you get spanked.  I've personally never put uncured silicone into the PC before so can't say one way or the other, but that isn't the point.  Until you try it, don't flame another member for saying it works.  Get to experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;go back to mycotopia no one likes you here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't stir up shit between sites.  The forum is about mycology, not popularity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7514986</next>\n<prev>7514923</prev>\n<first>7448173</first>\n<last>7515012</last>\n<when>1192370054</when>\n<utime>10/14/07 04:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
