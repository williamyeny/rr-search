I discovered this by accident by using paper towels to place near where the humidifiers were causing drips.  There was always a big puddle of water on the floor of the mini greenhouse, but a few layers of paper towels, and they never got saturated.  They absorb the water, and then evaporate it away again.  Of course, they need to be changed out every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax paper layed over the top of any tray will help to hold humidity high right at the surface where it's needed most.  Lift it to fan, and replace the wax paper every two days or so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6962289</next>\n<prev>6961962</prev>\n<first>6961881</first>\n<last>6962353</last>\n<when>1180047484</when>\n<utime>05/25/07 01:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
