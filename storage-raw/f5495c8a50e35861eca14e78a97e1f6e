What I do is leave the foil on my lids until right before I inoculate. I flame sterilize my needle, enter my glove box, quickly but carefully pull back the tin foil and then inoculate through my self healing silicone injection port(SHIP). Leaving the foil on the tops of your jars will keep the spot you're injecting into relatively sterile, and that is much more sterile than if you were wiping it with cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bad procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil should be removed when the jars come out of the pressure cooker so they can dry.&amp;nbsp; Leaving the foil on gets the filter damp and a damp filter will allow contaminants to colonize right through to the substrate below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the holes are covered with micropore tape(as they should) it's a good practice to wipe the tape with alcohol before injecting.&amp;nbsp; Same for silicone ports.&amp;nbsp; Flame the syringe needle and inject while still hot.&amp;nbsp; The first drop of two of solution will cool the needle.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>20417861</next>\n<prev>20416443</prev>\n<first>20415033</first>\n<last>20418923</last>\n<when>1408031850</when>\n<utime>08/14/14 06:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
