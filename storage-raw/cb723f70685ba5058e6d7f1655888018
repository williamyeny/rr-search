{"key":"post-6902794","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6902794</id>\n<content>Nice find.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those growers who are still confused by all the pH talk, mushroom mycelium is &lt;i&gt;tolerant&lt;/i&gt; of a high pH, while trichoderma and especially cobweb(Dactylium) molds prefer an acid pH.  In fact, mushroom mycelium also prefers an acid pH, so in a perfect world without molds, we wouldn't use lime at all.  However, the world isn't perfect, and since our mushroom mycelium can &lt;i&gt;tolerate&lt;/i&gt; a high pH, while the chief bad guys can't, we use it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also found an initial pH of 7.5 to 8 seems to keep trichoderma at bay until you get a few flushes, but doesn't hinder the mushroom mycelium too much.  Gypsum also tends to help keep the pH where we set it, preventing wild swings in either direction.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6910202</next>\n<prev>6902382</prev>\n<first>6900673</first>\n<last>7337936</last>\n<when>1178921735</when>\n<utime>05/12/07 01:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
