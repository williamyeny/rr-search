This is exactly why I say to let them sit in the jars for one full week after they're fully colonized.  When you birth early, all they do is dry out.  Try a dunk and roll, but next grow, don't birth so early.  Being in a hurry with this hobby always delays things.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6768851</next>\n<prev>6768457</prev>\n<first>6768457</first>\n<last>6768851</last>\n<when>1176191125</when>\n<utime>04/10/07 10:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
