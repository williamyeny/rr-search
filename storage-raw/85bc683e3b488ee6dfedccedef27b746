{"key":"post-6467787","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6467787</id>\n<content>I see at least two different molds growing there.  Notice the line of separation between them near that bad spot.  There's no way to save those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jars look too wet, so use less moisture next time.  Also, I'd suggest removing the foil.  If the foil allows moisture to get your filter material damp, contaminants can colonize right through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds are killed by low temperatures, so when you see them in sterilized substrate, they usually either got in through a bad filter, or they were introduced at inoculation.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6467869</next>\n<prev>6467527</prev>\n<first>6460421</first>\n<last>6472311</last>\n<when>1169008524</when>\n<utime>01/17/07 06:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
