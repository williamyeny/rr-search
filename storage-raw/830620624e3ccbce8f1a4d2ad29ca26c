Casing is applied to the top where fruits form, not the bottom.  Coir/verm applied to the bottom is an additional &lt;i&gt;substrate layer&lt;/i&gt; however, and works fine.  It increases your substrate mass.  Both substrate and casing material should be pasteurized, not nuked or pressure cooked.  The beneficial bacteria that survive will help deliver a better pinset as well as protection from contaminant molds by keeping the material &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.  A sterilized substrate or casing is like a person with no immune system.  Whatever lands on it will grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6334704</next>\n<prev>6332191</prev>\n<first>6331808</first>\n<last>6335467</last>\n<when>1165258451</when>\n<utime>12/04/06 08:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
