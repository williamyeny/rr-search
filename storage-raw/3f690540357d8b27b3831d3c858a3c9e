What I did, was I cased as soon after I crumbled up the jars and put them in their new container. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I look back on it and have done some more research, I believe that you should let them recover for some period of time before you case. That way they don't waste all their energy trying to do many things at once. Don't stress them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply casing layer immediately which allows the grains or brf to recover right into the casing.&amp;nbsp; This way you don't stress the mycelium out by having to recover twice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18527642</next>\n<prev>18527155</prev>\n<first>18520357</first>\n<last>18533860</last>\n<when>1373251445</when>\n<utime>07/08/13 05:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
