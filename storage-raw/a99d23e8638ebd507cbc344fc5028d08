Direct misting, and then not increasing air exchange until the water either soaks in or dries off will also cause aborts.  Condensation is in no way an indication of humidity.  Condensation only indicates a temperature differential between inside the terrarium and outside.  Drill some holes in the sides and top to allow for more air exchange, and try to keep the humidity as close to 100% as you can get it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7066947</next>\n<prev>7066475</prev>\n<first>7066363</first>\n<last>7071017</last>\n<when>1182294196</when>\n<utime>06/20/07 02:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
