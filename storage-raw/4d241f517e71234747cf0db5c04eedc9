Then, put the moisture for fruiting in by soaking an hour or so after full colonization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've gone as low as 1:10 on spawn ratio using this method and still get colonized in ten to fourteen days or so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19682580</next>\n<prev>19680278</prev>\n<first>19679970</first>\n<last>19682580</last>\n<when>1394568462</when>\n<utime>03/11/14 11:07 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
