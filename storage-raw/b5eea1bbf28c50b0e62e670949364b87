How many humidity threads do you need to simply build a terrarium with three to five inches of well drained perlite in it?  That will provide 99% humidity, provided you drill holes in all six sides as suggested.  I have explained the physics behind it so many times already, I'm not going to type it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool mist humidifiers cost from $15 to $35 brand new, and a fraction of that at thrift shops.  If necessary, run one in the room your fruiting chamber is located in.  Right now, the ambient humidity in my house is 11% and my FC is at 98%, using only perlite and 1/4&quot; holes drilled into all six sides.  I fail to see why you're having so much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6906710</next>\n<prev>6906678</prev>\n<first>6906354</first>\n<last>6913370</last>\n<when>1179013879</when>\n<utime>05/13/07 02:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
