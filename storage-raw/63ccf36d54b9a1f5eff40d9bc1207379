Three sprayings 12 hours apart should take care of it.  If you wait for it to come back before you spray again, you'll never win the battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want 4 air exchanges per hour, not 4 per day.  Cut some holes in the FC or leave the lid crooked to provide the FAE you need.  Molds only thrive in still, stale air, so keep it fresh, and keep it moving.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6695452</next>\n<prev>6693462</prev>\n<first>6691747</first>\n<last>6695452</last>\n<when>1174455594</when>\n<utime>03/21/07 08:39 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
