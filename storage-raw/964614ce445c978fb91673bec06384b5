{"key":"post-5167699","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5167699</id>\n<content>My grain jars always have loose, dry looking kernels on top.  If you move the jar around, the kernels will roll around until they've been colonized.  In my opinion, that is the perfect moisture level.  If your grains are a bit on the dry side, they'll colonize much faster, and mushroom mycelium will be favored over bacteria.  I'd try using the jars just as they are.  I'll bet they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5167790</next>\n<prev>5167570</prev>\n<first>5167303</first>\n<last>5167895</last>\n<when>1137014936</when>\n<utime>01/11/06 11:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
