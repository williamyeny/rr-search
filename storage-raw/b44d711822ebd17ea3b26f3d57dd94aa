The reason is that it won't pin for that week anyway, so it's better to leave it in the jar so it isn't drying out during that 'consolidation' phase.  At that point, remove from the jar, rinse under the faucet, and then dunk and roll.  Don't wait for invitro pins.  It isn't necessary.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6854728</prev>\n<first>6853758</first>\n<last>6855114</last>\n<when>1177983538</when>\n<utime>05/01/07 04:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
