Also I read that people arent watering the cakes directly, but just adding the water to the perlite. I dont know what is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to mist several times per day. Once your substrate is fully colonized, evaporation of moisture from the substrate is the number 1 pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes we say massive air exchange is the number 1 pinning trigger, but it's simply two ways of saying the same thing.&amp;nbsp; Even if you have 99% humidity, if you're giving the correct amount of fresh air, your cakes or trays WILL begin to dry out after only a few hours.&amp;nbsp; This ebb and flow of substrate moisture content is what stimulates hyphal knot formation.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who only mists once or twice per week is going to have really crappy performance, either from a dry substrate, or from poor fresh air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly built mini-greenhouses work by circulating lots of fresh air within, and then you make up for the lost moisture by misting the substrate several times per day, and of course the overspray lands on the perlite, keeping it nice and moist.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you couple this with the proper frequency of light(5,000 Kelvin to 6,500 Kelvin) for several hours per day, stellar performance will ensue.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9694015</next>\n<prev>9693756</prev>\n<first>9693124</first>\n<last>9694015</last>\n<when>1233170660</when>\n<utime>01/28/09 09:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
