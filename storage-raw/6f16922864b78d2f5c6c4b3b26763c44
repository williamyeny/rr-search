However, turquoise isn't a mold color I know of.&amp;nbsp; Are you sure it isn't bruising?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9726137</next>\n<prev>9723073</prev>\n<first>9723073</first>\n<last>9734134</last>\n<when>1233621167</when>\n<utime>02/03/09 02:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
