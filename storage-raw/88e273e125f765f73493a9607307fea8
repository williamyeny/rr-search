I'll speculate your hygrometer needs to be calibrated.  If your pins sit there wet for any length of time, they'll abort.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest leaving the lid crooked when you go to work or otherwise leave for the day.  This will lower the humidity and provide air exchange while you're gone.  Definitely, those look too wet in your picture.  That's over 80% humidity for sure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5995725</next>\n<prev>5995592</prev>\n<first>5992286</first>\n<last>5995725</last>\n<when>1156526366</when>\n<utime>08/25/06 08:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
