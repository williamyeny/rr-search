It will keep the humidity near 100% right on the surface where primordia form, then as the pins grow, they will push the wax paper out of the way, opening the edges to allow for less humidity. It's sort of a self-regulating system.  Just be sure to change the wax paper out for a clean sheet every second day.  Also, you must use this tek right from the start.  If your casing has already been open and exposed, placing wax paper over it will help the contaminant spores to germinate and grow.  If used from the start, most contaminant spores falling from gravity will land on the wax paper, which you carefully remove and replace every 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just lay the wax paper over the top.  Don't try to tuck it under the cake or other substrate or you'll do more damage than good.  You can fold it if necessary to fit, but don't try to make a tight seal.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5139220</next>\n<prev>5137928</prev>\n<first>5136353</first>\n<last>5139504</last>\n<when>1136390470</when>\n<utime>01/04/06 06:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
