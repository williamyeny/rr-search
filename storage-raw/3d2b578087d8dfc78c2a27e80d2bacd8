Jars should be filtered so the PC can remain closed up until the thing returns to room temperature for safety sake.  Personally, I'd suggest ordering synthetic filter disks because they're thicker and stronger than tyvek with a smaller micron pore size, and just use them.  They're a lifetime investment because they don't wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use polyfill instead of tyvek or filter disks, just make a hole in the jar and stuff it with polyfill, then cover with foil.  There's no reason to try to use silicone and a polyfill filled syringe.  That adds several vectors of contamination that wouldn't be there the simple way.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5991377</next>\n<prev>5991161</prev>\n<first>5990060</first>\n<last>5992005</last>\n<when>1156394316</when>\n<utime>08/24/06 07:38 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
