These pictures were taken a few weeks ago, just before tossing the jars into the garbage without opening.  They were on the shelf behind some others, so I didn't catch it as fast as I should have.  However, there's no saving such a thing, even if you catch it early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest lesson to learn in mycology is to have no compassion.
