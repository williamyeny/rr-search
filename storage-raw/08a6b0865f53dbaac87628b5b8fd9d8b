Incubators cause way more problems then they solve.  I haven't used one in years.  Glass is an insulator and holds heat very well.  I've seen up to a ten degree increase over ambient in the temperature inside the quart jars of grains, when a thermocouple is inserted into the center of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem with using a tub as an incubator is stale air. It does little good to have filters and holes in your lids if they all just vent into a sealed tub.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal room temperature is fine for colonization of mycelium.  Colonization speed peaks in the 75F to 81F range, and falls off dramatically above 83F.  Stamets published a chart in one of his books that said 86F is the fastest for growth, and that is just plain wrong.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7087819</prev>\n<first>7086810</first>\n<last>7087855</last>\n<when>1182722888</when>\n<utime>06/25/07 01:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
