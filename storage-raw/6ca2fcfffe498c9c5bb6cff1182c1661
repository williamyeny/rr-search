After a few hours, simply pour off all that will pour off, then place back into fruiting conditions.  You can do it in still water or gently running water.  I prefer running water because it washes away possible contaminant spores that may have landed on the substrate/casing layer during the preceding flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6656527</next>\n<prev>6656424</prev>\n<first>6656205</first>\n<last>6659492</last>\n<when>1173575696</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 04:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
