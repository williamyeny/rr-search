You don't leave the verm dry or it sucks all the water out of the cake.  We only roll in dry verm because wet verm won't stick to the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should dunk for 24 hours, not 12, then rinse the cake under the faucet and roll the soaking wet cake in dry verm.  Once placed into the terrarium, you then mist the cake several times over the first few hours to slowly hydrate the vermiculite. That's how dunk and roll works.  If you left the verm dry, there's the answer to your problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it's impossible to have too high a humidity with cakes.  They do best at 99% to 100% humidity.  That's why terrariums with several inches of well drained perlite works best.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6760693</next>\n<prev>6760633</prev>\n<first>6755574</first>\n<last>6760761</last>\n<when>1176047817</when>\n<utime>04/08/07 06:56 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
