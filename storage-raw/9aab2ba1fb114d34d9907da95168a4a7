It looks like they could use an increase in air exchange.  Two humidifiers and perlite are total overkill in a terrarium, so I'd get rid of both humidifiers, and just keep the perlite.  That will give you 99% humidity.  You don't want your cakes waterlogged.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6342210</next>\n<prev>6341740</prev>\n<first>6341281</first>\n<last>6343012</last>\n<when>1165457990</when>\n<utime>12/07/06 04:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
