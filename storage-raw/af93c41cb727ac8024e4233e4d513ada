I've also seen no improvements from adding other seeds including flax seed to the brown rice flour mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see from some above posts there's still confusion on why we lime casing layers, when used.&amp;nbsp; Most important, don't lime substrates. Cubensis mycelium will colonize a slightly acidic substrate a bit faster than it will colonize a neutral or basic substrate.&amp;nbsp; The only reason we lime casing layers is because it tends to make a more inhospitable environment for mold spores to germinate.&amp;nbsp; Of course, with proper circulation of fresh air, molds will be rare, but the lime helps to raise the pH enough to hinder spore germination, while not bothering the mushroom mycelium, which is already well established.&amp;nbsp; Gypsum is not used to buffer pH. It will provide essential elements as said above, and it will help prevent clumping in grains as well as casing mixes.&amp;nbsp; It's not a case of you'll fail if you don't use gypsum, but simply a case of if you want the best performance, it's one of the things to add.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9819064</next>\n<prev>9814804</prev>\n<first>9806689</first>\n<last>9851934</last>\n<when>1234916328</when>\n<utime>02/18/09 02:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
