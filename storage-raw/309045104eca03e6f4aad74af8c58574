I tweak the cycle timer depending on season and ambient humidity in the room.  If you run it longer than fifteen minutes, you'll have water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burned up at least 20 coolmists before I stopped modding them and placed them inside.  The same two coolmists have now been in the mini-greenhouse for over two years.  Using hoses creates static pressure that ruins the bushings, thus burning out the motor in a very short time.  Coolmists are designed to provide humidity, not move air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7167094</next>\n<prev>7167013</prev>\n<first>7164555</first>\n<last>7200439</last>\n<when>1184281856</when>\n<utime>07/13/07 02:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
