Perlite will easily take the humidity to near 100% which is great for brf cakes, but much too high for cased substrates.  Shoot for 80% humidity, then lay a sheet of wax paper over the casing layer to help stimulate pinning.  Once the pins grow, they'll push the wax paper out of the way, naturally lowering the humidity at the casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember that proper air exchange is the key to avoiding molds. Cobweb and trichoderma will only grow in stale, damp, still air.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5167477</next>\n<prev>5166256</prev>\n<first>5166256</first>\n<last>5167807</last>\n<when>1136978716</when>\n<utime>01/11/06 01:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
