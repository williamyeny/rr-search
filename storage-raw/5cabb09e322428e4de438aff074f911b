Beans are mediocre at best, and contaminate with bacteria sooner and easier than other choices.  In all the times I've seen folks start bean grows, I've never seen one single fruit from the effort.  The beans are so large, that even if you did get them to colonize, a jar would have less than half the mycelium of a jar of popcorn, which has less than 1/4 the mycelium of rye or wbs. Beans are NOT just like grains.  Grains are the seeds of cereal stalks.  Beans are legumes.  That's a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6593002</next>\n<prev>6584376</prev>\n<first>6582929</first>\n<last>6619698</last>\n<when>1171894763</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 04:19 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
