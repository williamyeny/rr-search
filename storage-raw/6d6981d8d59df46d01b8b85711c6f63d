A bit of bacteria in the FC is actually good.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be assumed that mold spores are going to be getting into the fruiting chamber, so the key is to make sure there is enough air exchange to prevent their growth.  Molds grow in stale, still air, so the more you can do to keep fresh air flowing while still keeping the humidity high, the better.  Air exchange is the key to preventing contaminants in a fruiting chamber, not sterility.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6318799</next>\n<prev>6318795</prev>\n<first>6317907</first>\n<last>6318799</last>\n<when>1164831678</when>\n<utime>11/29/06 10:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
