Cool mist humidifiers are designed to raise humidity, not move air.  If you try to use one to move air, it will only last a very short time due to the static pressure produced, which ruins the motor and bushings.  For best results, use a humidifier for humidity, and vents for air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6413071</next>\n<prev>6413005</prev>\n<first>6412416</first>\n<last>6414826</last>\n<when>1167584326</when>\n<utime>12/31/06 06:58 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
