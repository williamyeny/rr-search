Loss of moisture from the substrate, which means give lots of fresh air exchange. Bright high frequency light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've left the polyfill in the holes, that could be part of the problem.&amp;nbsp; Remove it.&amp;nbsp; Allow the substrate to dry out somewhat, and then replace that moisture with misting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10703235</next>\n<prev>10703148</prev>\n<first>10699066</first>\n<last>10869121</last>\n<when>1248019163</when>\n<utime>07/19/09 06:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
