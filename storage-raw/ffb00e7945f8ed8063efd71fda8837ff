As to the bleach, I was just talking about your garden variety bleach used for clothes. Was just thinking in the event of a contam issue, just shooting 10-20 cc of bleach into the injection port of the bad jar, shake, let sit for a few hours, then open/dump/clean. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; The bleach wouldn't penetrate all the cells.&amp;nbsp; We dunk cakes for 24 hours to fully hydrate them, so a few hours isn't going to be effective.&amp;nbsp; Besides, bleach is not that effective on mold anyway.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest taking the jars outside to dump them out, or simply tossing them in the trash if you don't want to boil them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10110491</next>\n<prev>10104916</prev>\n<first>10079502</first>\n<last>10110491</last>\n<when>1238939719</when>\n<utime>04/05/09 04:55 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
