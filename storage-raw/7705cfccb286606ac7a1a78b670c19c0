Bacteria!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorrect.&amp;nbsp; Urea is toxic to fungi and this is the reason we use &lt;i&gt;field aged&lt;/i&gt; manure. This ensures the urea and the especially toxic byproduct after bacteria get to it; ammonia, is evaporated off.&amp;nbsp; Your entire concept is based on a false premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, chemical fertilizers are not made with urea. they're most often made using ammonium nitrate, something I doubt your bacteria would appreciate too much and mycelium isn't too appreciative of salts either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet observed anything which can be added to mushroom substrates to make the fruits more potent. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19515225</next>\n<prev>19515136</prev>\n<first>19511982</first>\n<last>24817404</last>\n<when>1391448019</when>\n<utime>02/03/14 07:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
