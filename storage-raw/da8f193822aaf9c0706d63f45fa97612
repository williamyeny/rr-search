It takes awhile usually to see any rhizomorphic mycelium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll rinse the heck out of your rye berries before you begin the soak or simmer, they won't clump up later.  Just put the dry grains in a kettle, fill with water and stir around, then drain out and repeat a few times until the water pours off clear.  You'll be amazed at how cloudy and dirty the first few washes will pour off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make my jars a bit on the dry side.  I don't ever just case the straight rye, but use it for spawn so it really doesn't matter, and the jars are much easier to shake when a bit dry then when a bit wet. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5597236</next>\n<prev>5595680</prev>\n<first>5593740</first>\n<last>5614194</last>\n<when>1146889136</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 07:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
