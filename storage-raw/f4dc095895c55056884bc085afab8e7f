{"key":"post-6859987","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6859987</id>\n<content>Don't use peroxide on grains and then expect to grow from spores.  Peroxide is toxic to spores and young, not well established mycelium.  In fact, don't use peroxide on ANYTHING except to kill Dactylium on casing layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless it's a HUGE bag, don't use over three to five ml of spore solution or liquid.  More than that will be too much and throw off your moisture content.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6860002</next>\n<prev>6859823</prev>\n<first>6859823</first>\n<last>6864239</last>\n<when>1178072664</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 05:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
