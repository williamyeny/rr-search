A few growers can get pf type jars finished in two weeks, but I'd say the average is about three, so yours have a week to go.  You then want to wait a week after full colonization in order to allow the mycelium to consolidate its hold on the substrate prior to birthing and dunk and roll, so you're looking at birthing in about two weeks from now.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6934031</next>\n<prev>6933967</prev>\n<first>6933967</first>\n<last>6934031</last>\n<when>1179503652</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 06:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
