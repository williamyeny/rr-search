They each got a few more flushes and the green didn't even appear again before I threw them out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as those few flushes were worth giving up the hobby until you move to a new house, you're good.&amp;nbsp; The reason we don't ever cut molds out of substrates is because it releases billions of spores into your home.&amp;nbsp; They stick to the walls, ceiling, curtains, floors, etc., only to break loose and become airborne with changes of temperature or a breeze, and will ruin your future projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect a much higher rate of contamination in the future.&amp;nbsp; A quick search will reveal many threads like this one claiming success.&amp;nbsp; They will be followed in a month or two with a thread asking 'why is everything I grow all of a sudden getting trich' when it wasn't like this before.&amp;nbsp; Another month or two and we never see that member again because they've given up on the hobby.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19009453</next>\n<prev>19007318</prev>\n<first>19006497</first>\n<last>19010260</last>\n<when>1382363455</when>\n<utime>10/21/13 04:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
