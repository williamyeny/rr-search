If the rye came from a feed store, it probably has fungicides in it, which means you can't grow from spores.  You'd have to use liquid culture or agar wedges to inoculate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've found the endospores to be in the dust and chaff that rinse off easily as long as you rinse the rye berries prior to the soak.
