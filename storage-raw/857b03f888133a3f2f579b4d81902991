{"key":"post-3936825","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3936825</id>\n<content>True, and cold shocking is a myth for cubies.  If anything it sets them back.  Cold shocking is for cold weather edibles, not hot weather tropicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mushies are fine.  It's bruising as you've been told.  PE's do that.  If it were too dry in your chamber, the caps would be cracked.  Misting directly on fruits will bruise them.  With the bruising all on one side like that, I'd say your mister is probably to blame, but who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tap water is fine for dunking.  If anything, the chlorine will help prevent bacterial growth during the dunk.  That is why we dunk in the refrigerator.  It is to keep the temp lower to prevent bacterial growth, not to cold shock.  After the dunk, I recommend you wash the entire cake or casing under a faucet of running water.  Wash it really well, to get any slime that built up during the dunk off. This will also wash off any trich spores that landed on the casing during the last crop cycle. Re-case and place back in fruiting conditions.  PE is my favorite strain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3936948</next>\n<prev>3936706</prev>\n<first>3933764</first>\n<last>3945685</last>\n<when>1111192139</when>\n<utime>03/19/05 02:28 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
