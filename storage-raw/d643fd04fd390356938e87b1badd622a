If you're comfortable walking around with a short sleeve shirt, so will your mycelium.  You might get an extra day or two earlier colonization by heating, but thermophilic bacteria and molds will also be encouraged.   I do not own nor use an incubator of any kind.  I incubate all jars at normal room temperature on a regular bookshelf.  I've done it this way for years. It works, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4468138</prev>\n<first>4467831</first>\n<last>4468215</last>\n<when>1122646904</when>\n<utime>07/29/05 05:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
