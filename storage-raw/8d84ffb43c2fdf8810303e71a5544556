The problem is new folks do a grow by incubating in the dark and everything works out ok, so they think it was because of the darkness, when in fact it was because of everything else they did right.  Just keep them on a shelf in 75F to 81F temperatures and they'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6592127</next>\n<prev>6589343</prev>\n<first>6589156</first>\n<last>6592184</last>\n<when>1172004106</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 10:41 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
