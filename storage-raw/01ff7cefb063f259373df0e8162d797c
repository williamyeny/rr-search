In addition, once the mycelium begins to weaken after a massive spore drop, green mold is usually only a few days away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;migraineur said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if someone is growing mushrooms in a small tray in a shotgun terrarium then would pouring some water in the tray after the first flush and letting it sit for X amount of time before pouring the water out be beneficial or would this encourage contamination due to the high water content? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how you're supposed to rehydrate trays.&amp;nbsp; You can do it as you stated, or you can leave it in the sink with water slowly running for an hour or so, which tends to help wash the substrate clean as it soaks.&amp;nbsp; You can also mist, but if the substrate is really dry, that might not work so well.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to let the tray sit for a week after picking the flush in order to 'rest' before soaking.&amp;nbsp; Doing so will increase the performance of the next flush.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15993268</next>\n<prev>15992989</prev>\n<first>15992862</first>\n<last>15993426</last>\n<when>1332688101</when>\n<utime>03/25/12 06:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
