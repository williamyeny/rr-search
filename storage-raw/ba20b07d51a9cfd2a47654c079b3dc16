This time, cut some holes in the bottom of the bag near the perlite and another hole or two at the top to provide for some air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5905067</next>\n<prev>5905045</prev>\n<first>5904923</first>\n<last>5905121</last>\n<when>1154021748</when>\n<utime>07/27/06 08:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
