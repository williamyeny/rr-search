In the tech it calls for a thin layer of berm and coir on top of the mix, I assumed it was a casing due to the nature of it. So after this tech is fully colonized a casing would be a good to apply?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tek calls for a thin layer of verm/coir over the top after spawning for the purpose of covering all the exposed grains.&amp;nbsp; It's not a casing layer and it colonizes at the same time as the substrate, which it's a part of.&amp;nbsp; If one leaves grains exposed, they dry out which causes the mycelium to die-back.&amp;nbsp; Green molds then move into the available habitat, ruining the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your thread title should have read 'ideal amount of colonization for &lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt;'.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19451908</next>\n<prev>19451895</prev>\n<first>19448610</first>\n<last>19457859</last>\n<when>1390319069</when>\n<utime>01/21/14 05:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
