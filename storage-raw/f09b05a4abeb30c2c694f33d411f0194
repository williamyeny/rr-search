You still want to mist.  Cakes require as close to 100% humidity as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fact of physics is that a 20F(11C) rise in temperature cuts humidity in half, and a 20F(11C) drop in temperature doubles humidity, providing the amount of moisture stays the same.  You're better off fruiting at 22-24C than at 27C anyway.  Fruit quality will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drilling holes in the terrarium, especially on the bottom will raise humidity by providing for circulation through the perlite, and as the air passes the perlite, it will absorb moisture.  This also provides some of the air exchange you need.  I have a few hundred holes drilled into my terrariums, and they're always in the upper 90% humidity range.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6746164</next>\n<prev>6745459</prev>\n<first>6744881</first>\n<last>6748093</last>\n<when>1175701142</when>\n<utime>04/04/07 06:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
