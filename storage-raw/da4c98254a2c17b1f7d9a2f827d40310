{"key":"post-11579192","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>11579192</id>\n<content>I now have four 75X sterilizers, a 921 and a 941.&amp;nbsp; The 941 is too heavy for most stoves, unless you still have a good stove made in the 80's or earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start the 75X with hot water, and as said above, allow it to preheat while you're preparing your jars or whatever.&amp;nbsp; By the time you load the unit, you want the water boiling, and pressure will be reached much sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd go for the 75X, and then order a new burner and thermostat, plus a new blowout plug, relief valve and toggle valve.&amp;nbsp; This way, you'll have a good stock of spare parts, and it's still half the price of a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>11578469</prev>\n<first>11577482</first>\n<last>11579192</last>\n<when>1259891949</when>\n<utime>12/04/09 03:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
