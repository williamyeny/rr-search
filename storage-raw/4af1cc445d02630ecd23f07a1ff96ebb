Good Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is inappropriate in mushroom cultivation.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a hard time making a point about something with which you are not familiar, take time to compose yourself properly. Read carefully what the other has to say and don't draw conclusions based on a quick read where hot tempered emotion causes you miss the entire point. I was showing that we're in agreement on 90% of what is being discussed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flaming is never allowed in cultivation.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, public discussion of masturbation in the same breath as claiming a dedication to academia are mutually exclusive. Don't do that again.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13697508</next>\n<prev>13697171</prev>\n<first>13684454</first>\n<last>13720036</last>\n<when>1293586503</when>\n<utime>12/29/10 03:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
