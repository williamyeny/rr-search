I've managed to keep mine above 95% humidity by having two coolmists running on timers inside the greenhouse, with trays full of damp perlite on the floor to absorb the drips, and trays of damp perlite also go on any empty shelf space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My greenhouse is simply a PVC frame with plastic sheeting covering it.  It's very primitive, but works well and is three times the size of a Martha closet, and is 8 feet tall, running all the way to the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6152128</next>\n<prev>6151603</prev>\n<first>6150483</first>\n<last>6152128</last>\n<when>1160451807</when>\n<utime>10/10/06 06:43 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
