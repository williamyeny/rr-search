With oyster mushrooms, it's almost mandatory or the CO2 levels will be too high, even with all those holes.  You'll have to mist more often, but the air exchange makes it work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sproket13, you should have NO standing water.  There should be holes in the bottom of the terrarium for this system to work properly.  Rinse the perlite to get it uniformly damp, and then after draining, dump into the terrarium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7243855</next>\n<prev>7241268</prev>\n<first>7237368</first>\n<last>7244650</last>\n<when>1185852667</when>\n<utime>07/31/07 06:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
