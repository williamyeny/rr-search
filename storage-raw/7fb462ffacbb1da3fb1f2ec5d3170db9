You also said kernels were mixed in.  Are you speaking of the corn kernels?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the corn cobs were the casing layer, what was the substrate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn cobs are quite nutritious, so not suited for a casing layer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They make a nice substrate however.  Can you clarify what you did?  From what I can gather, you put colonized corn cobs and kernels into a tray to fruit.   If so, that would be a corn substrate, not casing.  It's interesting the corn could sprout after sterilization.  If it wasn't sterilized, it's hard to see how it didn't turn to a mass of green.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6012563</next>\n<prev>6010694</prev>\n<first>6010682</first>\n<last>6016365</last>\n<when>1156948434</when>\n<utime>08/30/06 05:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
