You can keep an isolated strain for a lifetime that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a piece of wood, such as a popsicle stick or medical tongue depressor into the slant with the agar.  The mycelium will colonize the wood(even non-wood decomposers, like cubes), and live for years in stasis in the refrigerator.  Once each three years, remove the slant from the refrigerator, let it sit at room temp for a few days, then use it to inoculate a petri dish.  Let the petri dish grow for a week, then immediately use the outer edges of the new growth, to inoculate more fresh test tube slants and start the process over again.  Using this method, even a 20 year old culture will have no more than two months worth of growth on it, thus still being young and viable.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6591207</next>\n<prev>6590824</prev>\n<first>6590824</first>\n<last>6598217</last>\n<when>1172025928</when>\n<utime>02/21/07 04:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
