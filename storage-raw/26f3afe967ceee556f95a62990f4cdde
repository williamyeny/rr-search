The yellow liquid looks like metabolites, but I'm not so sure that what you have growing is mushrooom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of condensation inside the jar too, so it looks like you might be colonizing at too high a temperature.  Any temperature over 80F is going to encourage molds and metabolite discharges.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When was that jar inoculated and what are the conditions of temperature?  Also, did you provide for gas exchange through holes in the lid?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6841789</next>\n<prev>6840502</prev>\n<first>6833275</first>\n<last>6846431</last>\n<when>1177695611</when>\n<utime>04/27/07 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
