This H2O2 method of doing things has been used, just not well documented around shroomery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull.&amp;nbsp; This so-called 'tek' has been around for at least 15 years that I know of.&amp;nbsp; It was bunk then, and nobody uses it because its still bunk today, and it always will be bunk.&amp;nbsp; Peroxide has a purpose for cobweb control, but won't kill most mold.&amp;nbsp; It's tough on the spores, but not on the mold mycelium itself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has all been gone over hundreds of times before.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to fail again if you'd like.&amp;nbsp; It's your time and your money.&amp;nbsp; We're telling you it's a crap method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayne says, it needs to adapt up to 2 weeks.
