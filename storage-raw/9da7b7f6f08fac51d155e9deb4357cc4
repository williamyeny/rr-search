Don't open it either or you'll just release the contaminant spores into the air, making future projects more likely to fail.  If you need to save the jar, PC first, or open outdoors and wash with the garden hose before bringing the jar back inside to wash properly.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6606784</next>\n<prev>6603407</prev>\n<first>6603383</first>\n<last>6607072</last>\n<when>1172282713</when>\n<utime>02/24/07 04:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
