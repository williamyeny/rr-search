Hold the mushroom upside down and tear the stem in half from the base to the cap.  Don't use a knife, just tear it.  This will expose some 'virgin' territory in the center of the stem.  Take your clone from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon,&lt;br /&gt;we must have similar shifts.  I work four days on, four days off.  12 hour days.  The four days on kinda sux.  I like getting four days off at a time though.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>2400079</prev>\n<first>2397617</first>\n<last>2400107</last>\n<when>1078367046</when>\n<utime>03/04/04 04:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
