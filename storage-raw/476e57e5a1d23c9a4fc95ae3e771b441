That would be like jumping off a tall building to see if you can fly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molds will be on or above the surface of a substrate or fruit.  They will look like a layer of sand or powder laying on the surface.  Bruising will be the color of the fruit itself.  Imagine if you took food coloring and dropped it on your mushroom.  It would soak in and turn the fruit that color-this would be bruising.   Now imagine if you took thick paint, and painted the substrate or mushroom.  The paint would be a layer above the surface-this would be mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6999473</next>\n<prev>6994023</prev>\n<first>6994023</first>\n<last>6999473</last>\n<when>1180700945</when>\n<utime>06/01/07 03:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
