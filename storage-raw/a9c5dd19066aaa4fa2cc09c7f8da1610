I normally spawn rye berries to bulk, but there's no denying the fact that pf cakes can outperform any other method.  Rye grains are my preferred source of spawn, and I use them ten times as much as pf cakes, but nothing else in 1/2 pint size will perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7005102</next>\n<prev>7004476</prev>\n<first>7002862</first>\n<last>7006718</last>\n<when>1180920026</when>\n<utime>06/04/07 04:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
