I believe that was an anomaly in the samples sent for testing.&amp;nbsp; After picking thousands of each, I'm firmly in the camp that says &lt;i&gt;P cyanescens&lt;/i&gt; is better, both from a potency standpoint and a quality of trip standpoint.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I quit making the annual fall run down to the mouth of the Columbia river a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a P cyanescens isolate that I'd have to say is a 3 to 4 on the scale that places cubes at 1. The average &lt;i&gt;P cyanescens&lt;/i&gt; would be at around 2.5, and the average &lt;i&gt;P azurescens&lt;/i&gt; I'd give a 2. &lt;i&gt;Mexicana A&lt;/i&gt; scerotia would be a 2 as well.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't that impressed with atlantis sclerotia, but I only grew them twice, so they're not really a representative sample.&amp;nbsp; As for subbs, I'd put them at .6 or so.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11796223</next>\n<prev>11796128</prev>\n<first>11795004</first>\n<last>13191896</last>\n<when>1263068119</when>\n<utime>01/09/10 10:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
