{"key":"post-6660821","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6660821</id>\n<content>I couldn't find the wiring diagram on graingers site either.  That's a single speed, dual voltage 115/230 volt motor, so you'll need to get a picture of the data plate.  I don't want to venture a guess and have you burn it up.  It's also 1000+ cfm at .8&quot; static pressure so I hope you have a huge flowhood or you'll need a motor speed controller to slow it down. It's too big even for a 48&quot; X 48&quot; HEPA without a speed controller. &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6660826</next>\n<prev>6660792</prev>\n<first>6658814</first>\n<last>6666845</last>\n<when>1173709898</when>\n<utime>03/12/07 05:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
