If you're interested in every grow being the same, isolate strains and pick a good one.&amp;nbsp; Then, you know what you have.&amp;nbsp; It makes no difference the name some jackoff wrote on a print.&amp;nbsp; Cubes don't even grow naturally in Hawaii, so obviously some moron made up a name to give to a cubensis he picked somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to consider that cubes didn't evolve separately in each area.&amp;nbsp; Spores are microscopic and can travel tens of thousands of miles on the trade winds.&amp;nbsp; This means cubes in America constantly exchange genetic information with cubes from Asia, and cubes in Africa are constantly getting new spores from the Americas, thus the species is one big melting pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt; is also the easiest mushroom to grow.&amp;nbsp; If anyone wants to improve their skills and understanding of mycology, it's important to learn to grow new species.&amp;nbsp; Then, you can take that wisdom and understanding and apply it to cubensis to create an isolated super strain, should you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12437030</next>\n<prev>12436383</prev>\n<first>12421168</first>\n<last>12437042</last>\n<when>1271952180</when>\n<utime>04/22/10 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
