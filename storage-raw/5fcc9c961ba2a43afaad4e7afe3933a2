It won't hurt, and with some species such as Shiitake, it's considered beneficial and makes them command a higher price.  In fact, they often lower humidity a few days before harvest to get the caps to crack.  With cubensis, they also tend to bruise, and many times cubes bruise more green than blue.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6940310</next>\n<prev>6938686</prev>\n<first>6937964</first>\n<last>6940310</last>\n<when>1179615345</when>\n<utime>05/20/07 01:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
