With few exceptions, one can't tell what kind of mycelium it is by looking.   An experienced cultivator on the other hand, can recognize the fragrance signature of different mycleia.  Shiitake has a distinct smell, as does oysters.  Ditto for morels.  Cubensis has a distinct mushroomy scent.   Trichoderma has a 'dirt' type smell to it.  If I have an outbreak of trich, I can smell it when I open the greenhouse door, a few days before it's visible as a green spot when it sporulates.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6589513</next>\n<prev>6589425</prev>\n<first>6589425</first>\n<last>6589513</last>\n<when>1172004476</when>\n<utime>02/20/07 10:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
