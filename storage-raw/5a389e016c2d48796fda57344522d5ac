Treat them like cubes only with a thinner substrate.  I go with no more than 1 1/2&quot; thick manure substrate, with 1/4&quot; to 1/3&quot; peat/verm casing layer.   They need a tad longer than cubes to pin generally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contaminants grow on substrates like any mycelium, and if they get a head start will ruin any grow.  Copes are no more susceptible to them than other species.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6772121</prev>\n<first>6772085</first>\n<last>6772428</last>\n<when>1176260481</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 06:01 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
