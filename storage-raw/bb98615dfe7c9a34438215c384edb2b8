I have never liked it. Its too fussy and dirty as hell. it is best to let it soak for a day or two, then boil/steep it for anywhere from 10-60 mins, drain it , fill jars, maybe wait another 24 hours and then pc it for 60-90 mins at 15psi. its so friggen acidic that the contams love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's pretty scary stuff there, and incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should never soak rye over 24 hours, or the rate of contamination will explode.&amp;nbsp; Rye grows on stalks of straw above the ground and is not dirty.&amp;nbsp; It has grain dust and chaff on it which needs to be rinsed off, same as any grain or bird seed.&amp;nbsp; Once jars are filled, they need to be sterilized immediately, not a day later, or bacteria bloom will have set in.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, rye is the exact pH favored by mushroom mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contaminants are not caused by choice of grain.&amp;nbsp; They're caused by failure to follow sterile procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster, unless you shook the jars just before taking the picture, that isn't trichoderma.&amp;nbsp; Trich won't pick out individual grains in a jar to colonize.&amp;nbsp; If you're going to use grains, pick up a bunch of synthetic filter disks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13939033</next>\n<prev>13931137</prev>\n<first>13921457</first>\n<last>13939843</last>\n<when>1297347414</when>\n<utime>02/10/11 04:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
