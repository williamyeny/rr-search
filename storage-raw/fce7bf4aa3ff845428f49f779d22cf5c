You want bright, intense light on your substrate for around 12 hours daily for best pinning and fruiting performance.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12922306</next>\n<prev>12914426</prev>\n<first>12914362</first>\n<last>12922306</last>\n<when>1279460109</when>\n<utime>07/18/10 04:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
