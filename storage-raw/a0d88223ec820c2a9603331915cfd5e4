Buy a 1/2&quot; 'romex connector' to act as a strain relief where the wire enters the electrical box on the motor.  This gives mechanical protection to the power cord so that if you pull or trip over the cord, it doesn't pull the splices apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREEN WIRE from your power cord goes to the chassis.  There should be a green screw to stick it under.  Don't skip this step.  The ground is what keeps you from getting shocked if something else goes wrong and/or shorts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITE WIRE goes to the white wire from the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLACK WIRE from your power cord goes to the black wire from the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tape up or otherwise insulate the RED wire from the motor.  You won't use it.  The red wire is for low speed operation.  You want high speed(black wire) with that 1/5 HP motor.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5976161</next>\n<prev>5976108</prev>\n<first>5976108</first>\n<last>5976199</last>\n<when>1155935307</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 12:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
