It's innefective as I said in dunk water because it breaks down so fast.  Besides, it's not necessary.  Yes, the only reason for using the refrigerator during the soak is to prevent bacteria from growing unabated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70F to 75F is great for fruiting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't confuse yourself with cold shocking right now.  You won't need to use it until you tire of cubes and move to edibles, at which time you'll want to build a refrigerated greenhouse like mine.  I maintain my greenhouse in the upper fifties to lower sixties for the shiitakes, enokis and hericium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6163879</prev>\n<first>6163464</first>\n<last>6164274</last>\n<when>1160715609</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 08:00 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
