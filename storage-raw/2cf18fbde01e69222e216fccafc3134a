It grows in the dead grasses and topsoil &lt;i&gt;below&lt;/i&gt; the cow pies.  The cow manure, which gets leached by rain and dried by the sun, serves as 'shade' to keep the area in the grass/manure boundry area moist, which is where the cubensis mycelium actually grows.  After a rain, the cow pie gets wet and serves as nature's casing layer, so the fruits pop out of it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6196819</prev>\n<first>6194293</first>\n<last>6196851</last>\n<when>1161525755</when>\n<utime>10/22/06 05:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
