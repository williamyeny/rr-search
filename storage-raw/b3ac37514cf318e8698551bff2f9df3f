Then the mycelium gets a head start on competitors when the coated disclets get dropped into the LC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you're missing is the cardboard won't be sterile and LC must be.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it's a myth that cube spores germinate well on cardboard.&amp;nbsp; They don't.&amp;nbsp; Even if they did germinate on cardboard, the mycelium would only be on the surface, not permeating the whole piece.&amp;nbsp; In addition, mold loves cardboard.&amp;nbsp; Ever leave a box out in a damp shed?&amp;nbsp; If so, it was covered in black mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest following established teks and later on with more experience, experiment all you want.&amp;nbsp; If you went two weeks with no activity on brf cakes, then either the procedure or your spores were bunk.&amp;nbsp; Normally, they're fully colonized in two to three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>10400969</prev>\n<first>10395753</first>\n<last>10400997</last>\n<when>1243351494</when>\n<utime>05/26/09 06:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
