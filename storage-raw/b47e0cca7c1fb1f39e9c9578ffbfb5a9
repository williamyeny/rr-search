Use one teaspoon of hydrated lime, and one tablespoon of gypsum per cup of peat, and mix into the dry peat.  Mix the dry ingredients very well, then slowly bring to field moisture level and pasteurize.  If you can't find hydrated lime, you can get it online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitbest.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doitbest.com&lt;/a&gt;   When you get to their website, do a search for hydrated lime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5371633</next>\n<prev>5370789</prev>\n<first>5369043</first>\n<last>5371880</last>\n<when>1141686937</when>\n<utime>03/07/06 01:15 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
