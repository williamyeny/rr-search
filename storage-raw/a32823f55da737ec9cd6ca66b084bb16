The scaling on the caps indicates low humidity.  Make sure your perlite was rinsed well, and then drained before placing in the terrarium.  Fluff it up with your fingers so it's loose and airy.  Raking some mountains and valleys into the perlite will also increase surface area.  Try to get the humidity into the mid 90's.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7769423</next>\n<prev>7769025</prev>\n<first>7769025</first>\n<last>7769423</last>\n<when>1197916095</when>\n<utime>12/17/07 08:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
