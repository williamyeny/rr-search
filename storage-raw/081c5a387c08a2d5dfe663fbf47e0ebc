That will preserve the small ones on the cluster from aborting.  The knife need not be sterile, just clean and very sharp so you don't bend the fruit or disturb it while making a slice a bit above where the others join. A razor blade works well. Once you cut the big one off, the small ones will be ready to pick within two or three days.  When you harvest them, remove the remnants of the stump.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6932812</next>\n<prev>6932573</prev>\n<first>6932497</first>\n<last>6932812</last>\n<when>1179467369</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 08:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
