{"key":"post-5391721","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5391721</id>\n<content>Back on topic, I see little to no correlation between substrate depth and pinset.  Pinset seems much more strain or substrain related, along with the skill of the cultivator.  Of course with a very thin substrate, a nice pinset will be more likely to have a lot of aborts, and a thicker substrate will be better able to support that same pinset.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5391925</next>\n<prev>5391627</prev>\n<first>5387531</first>\n<last>5392061</last>\n<when>1142190208</when>\n<utime>03/12/06 09:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
