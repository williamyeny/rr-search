Lift it to fan and/or mist.&amp;nbsp; Increased CO2 levels are detrimental to pinning, not an asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freshly made straw logs will drip for a couple of days due to the excess water being squeezed out of the straw.&amp;nbsp; Remember to pack straw logs tightly.&amp;nbsp; Put a tray under them for a few days.&amp;nbsp; The full tek is on my DVD, but you can get the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iplayerhd.com/player/f4d6984c-0a2f-42b0-852e-e49a9ed5daff.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;this short clip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can fruit straw logs in a mini-greenhouse or even in the open air if your house isn't too dry.&amp;nbsp; They also do well in the spring and fall months outdoors in a shady spot, especially if it's the rainy season.&amp;nbsp; Ditto for laundry baskets.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8629013</next>\n<prev>8627408</prev>\n<first>8627385</first>\n<last>8629497</last>\n<when>1215958634</when>\n<utime>07/13/08 05:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
