They don't care one whit whether the substrate is cased or uncased.  You should maintian humidity in the upper 90% range for best results when growing mushrooms.  The oft repeated advice that 'casings only require 80% humidity' is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dunk and rolled cake is simply dunked and rolled, not cased.  The verm serves as a &lt;i&gt;mini-casing&lt;/i&gt; to an extent because the verm acts as a moisture reservior to store water from misting, releasing it slowly to the mycelium.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7079412</next>\n<prev>7077580</prev>\n<first>7077527</first>\n<last>7080571</last>\n<when>1182486992</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 07:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
