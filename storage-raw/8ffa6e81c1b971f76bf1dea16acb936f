You are fruiting an uncased bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want as close to one hundred percent humidity as you can get.  I'd use three inches of damp, but not wet perlite covering the whole bottom of the tub.  If you keep it at or above 95% humidity, you won't need to mist.  Be sure to give plenty of air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6443163</next>\n<prev>6443094</prev>\n<first>6442983</first>\n<last>6444208</last>\n<when>1168399780</when>\n<utime>01/10/07 05:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
