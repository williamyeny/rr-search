The first time you drop the lid, your gauge is going to break off. I keep two blowout plugs, two gauges, two toggle valves for my sterilizers and a brand new nozzle and weight assembly for my AA 921 in stock at all times.&amp;nbsp; I also keep a spare heating element and thermostat for my AA 75X sterilizers.&amp;nbsp; This way, if something breaks, I'm back in operation in minutes, rather than days or weeks.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13700260</next>\n<prev>13699970</prev>\n<first>13696752</first>\n<last>13704002</last>\n<when>1293643932</when>\n<utime>12/29/10 07:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
