{"key":"post-5807081","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5807081</id>\n<content>I've never seen 1/2 gallon jars at fungi perfecti, other than on their website for sale. They used to use 1 gallon, but they were incubated at a 45 degree angle to allow for gas exchange. 1/2 gallon jars bite in my opinion.  The failure ratio I experienced was completely unacceptable due to anerobic conditions in the center of the jars.  You'll run into the same problem with 1 gallon unless you build angled shelves.  Personally, for home growers, 1 quart or 1 liter jars work best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5806734</prev>\n<first>5804813</first>\n<last>5807081</last>\n<when>1151702212</when>\n<utime>07/01/06 12:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
