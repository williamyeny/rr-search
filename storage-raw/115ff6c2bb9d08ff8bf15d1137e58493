We don't allow new members to post immediately in our Sponsors forum for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, new members can be a bit impatient and tend to shoot first and ask questions later. For example, if they do not receive their order within a week, or a handful of days go by without communication from the vendor, we have seen complaints and cries of being &quot;ripped off&quot; posted, only to see that their order was ultimately fulfilled and the vendor did come through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some sponsors have been known to provide incentives to customers who will sign up to post positive reviews. By implementing post restrictions in the Sponsors forum, we help mitigate this manipulation by ensuring that those who post in the forum are foremost community members, and not just someone stopping by to &quot;hit and run&quot; for a freebie in exchange for their positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick around for a while and participate in some of our other forums, your ability to post in the Sponsor's forum will automatically unlock after 30 days and 25 posts. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/cheers.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:cheers:&quot; title=&quot;:cheers:&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Do not bump your own thread for at least 24 hours.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; It's not fair to the other posters to have your thread constantly bumped to the top.&amp;nbsp; Violators will have their thread deleted.

If you're curious about if mushrooms are growing in your area, get out there and look! Mushrooms don't read the books. Sometimes they fruit outside of season. There is no set date for any season, only vast generalizations. Your best bet is that if it's close to the season for the mushroom you are looking for and its been raining, you just might find some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt; &lt;b&gt;Do not make threads or posts discussing or reporting the weather.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes complaining about the weather, asking if the current weather is &quot;good for shrooms&quot;, or how long to wait after rain fall to go hunting.&amp;nbsp; If it has rained within the last 1-10 days, and the temperatures are correct for the type of mushroom you're looking for, and the time of year is correct then it is certain that that the mushroom you are looking for is growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;14.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;No asking &lt;u&gt;when&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;where&lt;/u&gt; mushrooms, or a specific mushroom species will grow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes, asking what habitat a mushroom[s] can be found- or their preferred fruiting conditions.&amp;nbsp; This can be very simply answered by using the &quot;search posts&quot; feature: &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/search.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;search.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt; &lt;b&gt;No requesting or revealing specific locations.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use common sense about what might be considered a specific location.&amp;nbsp; Anything that could lead someone right to the spot is not allowed - It is perfectly fine to mention places that are more than a couple square kilometers.&amp;nbsp; When in doubt, do the moderators a favor and just don't say it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harassment of other members will not be tolerated at the Shroomery, and may result in an immediate ban depending on severity.&amp;nbsp; If you have a problem with another member, please make your peace with them.&amp;nbsp; If you cannot behave in a respectful manner, keep your words to yourself.&amp;nbsp; Failure to comply will result in administrative action at the sole discretion of the staff.&amp;nbsp; All members are encouraged to PM a moderator or administrator with relevant information if they cannot resolve their conflict privately. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger&quot;&gt;CONTESTS, GIVE AWAYS, TRADES, ECT...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--/larger//--&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must go in the marketplace forum, not here. If you want to give away prints, great.&amp;nbsp; Just do it in the marketplace please.&amp;nbsp; If you don't have access yet, wait until you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketplace access rules regarding time since registering were put in place for a reason, not the least of which is to discourage our members from giving their names and addresses to people who just recently joined and/or are not known. We don't allow new members to make posts seeking trades, as a means of protecting our established members, for obvious reasons.&amp;nbsp; You can't make a trade without giving your address, and receiving the address of someone else.&amp;nbsp; That's why we require 90 days since registration before having access to the marketplace forum.&amp;nbsp; 90 days is no guarantee of course, but it's long enough for most of the jerkoffs to become known and avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are trade ratings in addition to general ratings. These can be an indicator of who would be someone you have a safe bet trading with. That's not to say 50 positive trade ratings is a guarantee of anything. There have been cases of members with &amp;gt;50 +5 trade ratings later posting google image pictures of people's residences. As well as sending things months later which is evidence that people don't always destroy your address after sending. Play it safe and keep yourself safe when in doubt it's not worth saving the $10-20 it may cost to obtain what you're looking for a safe way. Trading is an amazing benefit that comes with our online mushroom community. Do your part and be a responsible trader. Delete addresses from your online mailboxes and shred letters with personal information. Misuse of personal information is grounds for permanent removal.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please follow the rule, and if you see a post asking for a trade in this forum, please hit the notify moderator button, which is the train whistle icon at the bottom of every post.&amp;nbsp; Don't argue with or flame the person making the inappropriate post, but simply hit that button and let us handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This sticky will be updated as necessary, so please check back often.**</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14960170</next>\n<prev></prev>\n<first>14960167</first>\n<last>14960170</last>\n<when>1314027030</when>\n<utime>08/22/11 06:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
