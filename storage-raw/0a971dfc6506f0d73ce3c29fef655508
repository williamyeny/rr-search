I'm all for research and development, and the ways we grow mushrooms today are quite a bit different than they were even five years ago when NOBODY thought coir could be used as a substrate.&amp;nbsp; Experimenting is what keeps our hobby fluid, and I hope that never changes.&amp;nbsp; Just try to avoid posting the cart before the horse, if that makes sense. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/peace.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:peace:&quot; title=&quot;:peace:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8887801</next>\n<prev>8886880</prev>\n<first>8883395</first>\n<last>8887891</last>\n<when>1220744548</when>\n<utime>09/07/08 02:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
