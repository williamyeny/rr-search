{"key":"post-6201432","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6201432</id>\n<content>You guys need to make a distinction between oven or water bath temperature and substrate temperature.  The &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;substrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; needs to be at 140F to 170F for an hour, but not over 1 1/2 hours.  Use a meat thermometer stuck into the middle of the substrate and manipulate whatever you have to in order to achieve the above.  Ovens are horrible for pasteurization because air is a poor at transferring heat.  Water is much better.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11885218</next>\n<prev>6201289</prev>\n<first>6199297</first>\n<last>11885218</last>\n<when>1161623017</when>\n<utime>10/23/06 08:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
