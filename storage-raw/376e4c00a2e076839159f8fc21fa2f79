I also tried elevating the jars up to 4 inches to expose jars to steam only.&amp;nbsp; I started out cooking for 90 mins at 15psi and worked my way down to 60 mins at 15 psi to try and reduce burning.&amp;nbsp; These are all the variables I can think to adjust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the grains are not burned.&amp;nbsp; The only thing that would burn the grains is having them on the bottom of the pc, exposed to the extreme heat of the stove burner, OR running out of water and roasting them, both of which usually also crack/break the jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's normal for the grains to be darker in color after sterilizing.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13182023</next>\n<prev>13181934</prev>\n<first>13181869</first>\n<last>13182023</last>\n<when>1284260820</when>\n<utime>09/12/10 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
