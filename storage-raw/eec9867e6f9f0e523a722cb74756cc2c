You don't have grocery stores in your area?  I live 65 miles from the nearest traffic signal, and 18 miles from the nearest town (with a population of 600), and the small local market has agar.  It's hard to imagine not being able to find it.  Look in the ethnic foods section.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8421805</next>\n<prev>8421757</prev>\n<first>8421319</first>\n<last>26817261</last>\n<when>1211251327</when>\n<utime>05/20/08 05:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
