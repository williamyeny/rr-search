We toss out contaminated substrates to avoid spreading billions of contaminant spores all over our grow areas, which would ruin future grows.

Toss out contaminated projects.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7313948</next>\n<prev>7313182</prev>\n<first>7309725</first>\n<last>7314188</last>\n<when>1187613225</when>\n<utime>08/20/07 03:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
