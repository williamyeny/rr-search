Check thrift shops or the goodwill/salvation army type places for a cheap used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pans will fruit on straw, but do much better on manure.  I've used both cow and horse and both work fine.  I prefer horse manure because of its texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ovens are horrible for pasteurization.  The reason is that air is a poor conductor of heat.  By the time the heat penetrates to the middle of your substrate, the outside edges are cooked/sterilized, which is bad.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pasteurize small amounts of manure in a large pot of water.  I put the fully hydrated manure into quart jars and pasteurize that way.  Simply heat the water until the center of the jars are at 140F to 170F for an hour.  This will require a meat thermometer and standing over the operation the first few times until you get the procedure down with your stove/pot/jars combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make the spawn with pf tek, then use those cakes to spawn to the manure.  Make the substrate no more than 1 1/2&quot; thick.  Pans fruit poorly on thicker substrates.  At full colonization, case with 1/4&quot; of casing material.  Pans colonize and fruit best at around 80F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6520612</next>\n<prev>6519708</prev>\n<first>6518550</first>\n<last>6520612</last>\n<when>1170357442</when>\n<utime>02/01/07 09:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
