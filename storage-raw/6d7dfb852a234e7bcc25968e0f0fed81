If you have powdered limestone, I imagine it would also go to work very soon.  Hydrated garden lime is what I've used for many years.  I think somebody accidently bought hydrated lime from an industrial supply and got the kind used in cement work which is ten times or more as potent, and it burned up his crop.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hydrated garden lime, I use 1 teaspoon per cup of peat.  Don't count the verm, because it's neutral.  Mix the lime with the dry peat before wetting it and mixing with the verm.  I also use about ten percent by volume garden gypsum.  My latest bag of garden gypsum came from a drywall factory, because I can tell it's crushed sheetrock.  It even has little scraps of drywall paper in it, so you can always find gypsum just by buying a sheet of drywall.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5687306</next>\n<prev>5686946</prev>\n<first>5686946</first>\n<last>5687396</last>\n<when>1148941997</when>\n<utime>05/30/06 01:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
