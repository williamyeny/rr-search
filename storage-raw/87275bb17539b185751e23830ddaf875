All you need to do is kill any trich or other fungi spores that are present.  That's why we only pasteurize casings.  You actually want a small amount of bacteria in your casing, as it helps to promote a better flush.  I would recommend pasteurizing in quart jars.  Place the jars in your PC or other large covered pot with COLD water half way up the jars.  Turn on the stove.  As soon as the water boils, turn off the stove.  After one hour, you can remove the jars.  When cool, they're ready to use.  Don't forget to use hydrated lime mixed with the peat at the rate of 5%.(that means one tablespoon of lime for each 20 tablespoons of dry peat)  Don't count the verm when figuring how much lime to use.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3007279</next>\n<prev>3006227</prev>\n<first>3006227</first>\n<last>3010556</last>\n<when>1092618961</when>\n<utime>08/16/04 04:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
