You can mist or you can wash the whole darn block under the faucet, even when it has fruits on it.  I'd put it outside at night if it's cool, and then bring it in during the day, but try to keep it in a cool place indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll want to learn agar and sporeprinting/cloning techniques if you want to perpetuate the cycle.  The chances of getting the shiitake spores to take on sawdust as opposed to all the other spores floating around are not good.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7641093</next>\n<prev>7640232</prev>\n<first>7640036</first>\n<last>7641618</last>\n<when>1195173196</when>\n<utime>11/16/07 02:33 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
