There are 4 videos......lol  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR are you spamming on amazon???? :p &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  I would never write a bad review of a competing product.  Besides, amazon can't seem to keep my dvd in stock anyway.  It sells out within days of their receiving a fresh carton.  They received another shipment Friday, so they should update it to show in stock by Monday or Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRF will deliver the most product for the size substrate, bar none.  It's not my choice to grow with, but nobody can deny that pf cakes, which only have a few tablespoons of brf in each jar, produce more mushrooms than any other substrate used at the same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grains require a pressure cooker.  If no pressure cooker, use brf cakes.  Flowers grow on plants.  Flour is ground grain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7938632</next>\n<prev>7935066</prev>\n<first>7934836</first>\n<last>7942968</last>\n<when>1201386230</when>\n<utime>01/27/08 12:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
