{"key":"post-4273836","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>4273836</id>\n<content>True, nothing is better than free shit, except perhaps shit that actually works.  Post office tyvek is mediocre at best, and downright crappy at worst.  Synthetic filter disks are best, polyfil is perhaps second best, but be sure to keep it dry, and thick kite or garmet grade tyvek would be a distant third, while the post office tyvek is a very far fourth choice.  I've used them all.  You can't expect something no thicker than a piece of paper to perform a function as well as something manufactured for the purpose.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4273866</next>\n<prev>4273811</prev>\n<first>4273659</first>\n<last>4280937</last>\n<when>1118288870</when>\n<utime>06/09/05 06:47 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
