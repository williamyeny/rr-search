I've had a coir doormat outside my house for years, and it stays damp for months every spring and fall without a single spot of trich forming. Your LC is contaminated.&amp;nbsp; It's very common for molds to be fully colonized into grains and not sporulate until spawned to a bulk substrate material.&amp;nbsp; Always sniff each and every jar of spawn before using.&amp;nbsp; You can detect most molds by scent, since they smell a lot like dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd suggest moving on from LC.&amp;nbsp; It's a very lame procedure that takes much longer than expanding mycelium on grains.&amp;nbsp; In addition, LC favors molds over mushroom mycelium, and you never know if it's contaminated until you use it, wasting months of time.&amp;nbsp; It's the exact reason there's no LC tek on my DVD.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13664598</next>\n<prev>13664521</prev>\n<first>13664521</first>\n<last>13669601</last>\n<when>1292945055</when>\n<utime>12/21/10 05:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
