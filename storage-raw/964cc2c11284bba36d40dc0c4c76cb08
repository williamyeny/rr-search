That's why you're reading only 78% humidity, which won't grow mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a heating pad under a shotgun terrarium defeats the principle of operation.&amp;nbsp; You want it slightly cooler under the perlite than above, in order to stimulate air currents to travel up from the holes in the bottom through the damp perlite, absorbing moisture as they go, thus increasing humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to run a small heater in the room your terrarium is located in, raising the temperature in that room up to 22C to 26C.&amp;nbsp; The down side is that heating a room lowers the humidity, so I'd suggest running a humidifier or vaporizer in that room to raise the ambient humidity up to 50% or greater.&amp;nbsp; Raising the humidity in your room will not only make your terrarium work better, but it will lower your heating bills, because moist air holds the heat better due to its thermal mass.&amp;nbsp; Once you get the humidity in your room to 50% or greater, your terrarium will easily hold humidity in the upper 90% range.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to use a calibrated analog hygrometer, not electronic, which isn't accurate in near saturation humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read the principles of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium tek&lt;/a&gt; on my website.&amp;nbsp; I put it up there because it's easier to link than to type it out each time.&amp;nbsp; Good luck to you.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8552860</next>\n<prev>8550022</prev>\n<first>8549465</first>\n<last>8552860</last>\n<when>1214141792</when>\n<utime>06/22/08 04:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
