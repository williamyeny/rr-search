In addition, be sure to stack the dishes in a vertical configuration for colonization.  Temperature differential causes condensation, so both the hot agar, and also the heat produced by the mycelium will cause condensation.  Stacking the dishes helps prevent condensation from the latter by equalizing the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8152710</next>\n<prev>8152694</prev>\n<first>8152668</first>\n<last>8152710</last>\n<when>1205680588</when>\n<utime>03/16/08 06:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
