I fill trays with damp perlite and keep every bit of open shelf space covered with them.  This will help to keep it in the upper nineties, and you can adjust the timer so your humidifier runs less.  If you're going to be gone, simply adjust your timer so the humidifier runs half as long as normal.  This will keep it from running totally out and drying your crop on the last two days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6699664</prev>\n<first>6699664</first>\n<last>6699892</last>\n<when>1174602999</when>\n<utime>03/23/07 01:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
