If you're doing it in the oven, make sure it's in plastic bags so it doesn't dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick a meat thermometer into the center of the manure, and give it an hour from the time it reaches 140F.  Try not to let it go over 170F.  I'd suggest upping the oven to 250F or so to speed things up.  Still, water is a better heat transfer media than air, so it would work better in a pot of water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7071957</next>\n<prev>7071458</prev>\n<first>7071312</first>\n<last>7074754</last>\n<when>1182395264</when>\n<utime>06/21/07 06:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
