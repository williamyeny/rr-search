If you heat the terrarium, it will draw moisture from your substrate in order to use it as condensate on the sides of the terrarium.  I neither heat my house in the winter nor cool it in the summer(mild climate), so I experience fluctions in temperature too.  It's not really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5738157</prev>\n<first>5723227</first>\n<last>5738816</last>\n<when>1150068264</when>\n<utime>06/12/06 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
