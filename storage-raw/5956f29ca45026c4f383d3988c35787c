{"key":"post-6228203","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6228203</id>\n<content>Gloveboxes are not sterile.  The air inside a glovebox is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt;.  By having still air, the contaminant spores that are there don't get blown in by natural room circulation which is what happens in open air.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps to mist the air within the glovebox.  The mist will tend to collect spores in the air and drop them to the floor of the glovebox.  Don't use Lysol or oust if you plan to use a flame to sterilize needles or scalpels, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grain to grain transfers are much easier with a flowhood, but a tall rubbermaid makes a glovebox big enough to pour from one jar into the other.  I wouldn't recommend doing 20 to 1 though.  10 to 1 is a good ratio.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6228349</next>\n<prev>6228138</prev>\n<first>6226899</first>\n<last>6234475</last>\n<when>1162262575</when>\n<utime>10/31/06 04:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
