It's also a great way to crack the metal, destroying the pressure cooker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the original poster, simply follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf tek&lt;/a&gt; to the letter and you'll get great results.&amp;nbsp; You'll also see some of fahtster's cakes in the video, part 3.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9533562</next>\n<prev>9533302</prev>\n<first>9530928</first>\n<last>9543482</last>\n<when>1230945531</when>\n<utime>01/03/09 03:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
