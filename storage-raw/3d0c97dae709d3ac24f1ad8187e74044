{"key":"post-15344027","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>15344027</id>\n<content>I'm too anal about my stuff to let the Mrs or especially an employee take care of it.&amp;nbsp; She does the mushroom house chores and prepares all the grain spawn, but it took nearly ten years to trust her with those two jobs. (did I mention I'm anal about that shit?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can stuff the boiler with logs and go 8 hours, but it causes a lot of smoke and creosote buildup in the chimney.&amp;nbsp; I've already had one chimney fire, and it scared the hell out of me.&amp;nbsp; The whole stack was glowing red-hot and flaming creosote was shooting out the top.&amp;nbsp; If we hadn't already had snow cover on the ground, I'd have started a forest fire.&amp;nbsp; Can't let that happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to lighten up and let the Mrs fill in now and then, but I'd lay awake worried she'd screw it up. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm working on taking it &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/15325625#15325625&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big-time&lt;/a&gt; with a new mega-facility, at which time I'll retire this operation.&amp;nbsp; Until then, I doubt I'll get much sleep.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15344028</next>\n<prev>15344001</prev>\n<first>15343842</first>\n<last>15411749</last>\n<when>1320858227</when>\n<utime>11/09/11 07:03 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
