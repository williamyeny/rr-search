The holes should be on all six sides, and the tub should be at least three times as tall as that one.  It isn't so much space for the fruits to grow as it's about more room to dissipate the stale air.  I'd suggest a tub much taller, with three to five inches of well drained perlite on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any perlite that is covered up by the tray renders it useless.  The tray should be supported above the perlite, so the perlite can do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn't bacillus on the top of the turkey pan tray, but rather metabolites.  It's also too dry, so I'd let some water from the faucet gently run into that tray, overfilling it for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7580139</next>\n<prev>7577264</prev>\n<first>7576419</first>\n<last>19712214</last>\n<when>1193841085</when>\n<utime>10/31/07 05:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
