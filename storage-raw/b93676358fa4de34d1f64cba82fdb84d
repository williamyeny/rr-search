Water will seek the lowest spot, so it won't just flow if the level drops below the jug. The entire jug will drain as soon as you put it in place.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my cheapo vics coolmist will run for nearly two weeks without refilling and that's humidifying a greenhouse about three to four times the size of a martha. We leave for a week at a time on a regular basis and all is fine. It only needs to run for a minute, then off for six to ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5735616</next>\n<prev>5735581</prev>\n<first>5735539</first>\n<last>5735720</last>\n<when>1149994704</when>\n<utime>06/11/06 05:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
