The problem is noobs have an idea and write up a &quot;I wonder if this would work?&quot; post, but phrase it as a tek, which then becomes searchable and other noobs see it and follow the darn thing, losing their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple fact of physics is the air that flows up from the oven MUST be replaced by cold air below.  Therefore, there is just as much air flowing IN as there is flowing OUT.  The result is a higher rate of contamination than if you were using open air, which is also not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7817403</next>\n<prev>7817360</prev>\n<first>7816366</first>\n<last>7817560</last>\n<when>1199137969</when>\n<utime>12/31/07 11:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
