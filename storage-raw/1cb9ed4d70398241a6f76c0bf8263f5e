You want STILL air, not turbulent air.  Open the holes up inside a glovebox.  You can easily make one out of a cardboard box with two arm holes cut into it with a knife.  It doesn't need to be sterile, just no air currents.  You can also hold an alcohol soaked rag around the nail when you punch the hole so the air has to flow past the alcohol, killing 'most' of the contaminant spores.  Spray oust, or even just a bleach/water solution inside the box to cause the contaminants inside to settle to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use synthetic filter disks.  They're the best and longest lasting, in my opinion.  I have some that are five years old and still work like new.  They've been used and reused hundreds of times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5968564</prev>\n<first>5968007</first>\n<last>5968795</last>\n<when>1155735358</when>\n<utime>08/16/06 04:35 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
