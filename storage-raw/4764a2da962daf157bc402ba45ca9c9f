In addition, the foil wouldn't stop a mold spore anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always remove the foil when the jars come out of the sterilizer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14649495</next>\n<prev>14648821</prev>\n<first>14623042</first>\n<last>14649647</last>\n<when>1308696133</when>\n<utime>06/22/11 01:42 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
