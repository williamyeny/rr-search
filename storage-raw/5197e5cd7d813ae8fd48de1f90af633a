Lift them up and do as I suggested above, cutting away the mycelium that has departed the cake.  Your mycelium will waste energy on cell-division with no intake of food by colonizing the perlite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, water logged cakes perform poorly.  You want your cake to dry out slightly during a flush, then you re-hydrate for the next flush.  Mist as required to supply the moisture needed as the fruits grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8419990</next>\n<prev>8419895</prev>\n<first>8419653</first>\n<last>8420123</last>\n<when>1211221894</when>\n<utime>05/19/08 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
