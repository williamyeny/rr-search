Bagged composted cow manure is available in 40 lb bags at any hometown nursery so don't waste your money getting a 5 lb bag mailed to you from somebody that simply gets a $4 bag at the nursery and divides it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've used it many times as part of my substrate mix.  It should be mixed with something to fluff it up such as coir, verm, or horse manure because composted cow manure can tend to pack down, which makes it hard for the mycelium to colonize.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6703998</prev>\n<first>6703998</first>\n<last>6704090</last>\n<when>1174698521</when>\n<utime>03/24/07 04:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
