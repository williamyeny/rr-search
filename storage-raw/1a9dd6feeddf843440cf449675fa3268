Do you really think all of us who are preparing coir this way are stupid and like getting trich? The more you rail on it the more you'll seem antiquated and out of touch with current trends. Hell you should make a video on it. I don't think you have any coir prep videos up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;anonjon said:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps be less snarky and self-righteous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps follow your own advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're apparently not aware of this, but several years ago, I was the first person to use and suggest coir to the community as a bulk substrate material.&amp;nbsp; Prior to that it was considered at most a 'casing' layer with no nutrients.&amp;nbsp; I made many coir grows, and showed them here.&amp;nbsp; Still, people were saying it wouldn't work, wouldn't be potent, wasn't as good as manure, etc.&amp;nbsp; Today it's the substrate of choice for people in cities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your original question was about thermophilic bacteria.&amp;nbsp; If you feel dumping boiling water on them is productive, then why the original statement about pasteurizing over sterilizing?&amp;nbsp; The fact is, coir has very few of these, and that's why people get away with sloppy procedure.&amp;nbsp; Use that so-called bucket tek with manure, compost, straw, coffee grinds, etc., and see how far antiquated and out of touch I am for suggesting otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13887243</next>\n<prev>13886244</prev>\n<first>13870557</first>\n<last>13889630</last>\n<when>1296574630</when>\n<utime>02/01/11 05:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
