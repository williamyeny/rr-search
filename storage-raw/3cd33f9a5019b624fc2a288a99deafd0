A large bag of substrate will take much longer than a small bag, but you can't do it with the oven only on 170 or it will take overnight at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ovens and microwaves are terrible for pasteurization.  Ovens are bad because air is a poor conductor of heat, and it's hard to get a thermometer into your substrate in an oven without drying it out.  Microwaves don't pasteurize, they partially sterilize which is less than desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to pasteurize in a large pot of water.   Do whatever you have to do to get the center of your bag of substrate to reach 140F to 170F for one hour.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6170930</prev>\n<first>6167391</first>\n<last>6170995</last>\n<when>1160912656</when>\n<utime>10/15/06 02:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
