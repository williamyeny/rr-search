{"key":"post-6593820","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6593820</id>\n<content>I was blowing up half my bags with the nozzle and weight setup.  That's why I changed it out.  Actually, I replaced my nozzle with a brass valve from the auto parts store for radiator drains that I can open and shut tight.  It only cost $3   However, it has to be watched because the only safety feature becomes the rubber blow-out plug and that's not a good thing, so I don't recommend my setup unless you're anal about watching the PC the way I am.  You should have dual redundancy on any safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6593869</next>\n<prev>6593680</prev>\n<first>6593058</first>\n<last>6724355</last>\n<when>1172090341</when>\n<utime>02/21/07 10:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
