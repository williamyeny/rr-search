The lack of diversity is what makes it have the distinctive shape more often than not, and probably why it has consistent potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see this first hand for yourselves, all you guys need to do is get a sporeprint and do a series of strain isolations.&amp;nbsp; Fruit each one and you'll see the diversity.&amp;nbsp; You'll have large fruits, small fruits, large caps, small caps, tall fruits, short fruits, various colors, thick stems, thin stems, and potency that varies across the spectrum, just like the other factors listed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11790032</next>\n<prev>11789764</prev>\n<first>11784347</first>\n<last>16191903</last>\n<when>1262985369</when>\n<utime>01/08/10 11:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
