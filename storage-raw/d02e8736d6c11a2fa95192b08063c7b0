I know you need to dilute it normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wondering if it would kill the cake to be exposed to peroxide straight out of the bottle or damage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anobody ever tried?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not even sure you could GET pure peroxide unless you're NASA or some other agency like that.&amp;nbsp; The highest concentration I've seen is around 40%, and that would melt your cake away in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why on earth would you want to dunk your cakes in something toxic?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13450265</next>\n<prev>13450245</prev>\n<first>13450184</first>\n<last>13450479</last>\n<when>1289181946</when>\n<utime>11/08/10 04:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
