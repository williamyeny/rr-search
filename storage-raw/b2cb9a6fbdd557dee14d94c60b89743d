They were probably fighting a bit of bacteria that got a start due to low gas exchange and high temperatures. You do want to keep it fairly well sealed up during colonization.  The reason is to hold in the CO2, because a high CO2 level during colonization keeps the mycelium from 'eating' as much of your substrate.  I'd avoid saran wrap in the future, and use a black tray with foil crimped over the top and two or three nail sized holes poked into it.  This will allow a bit of gas exchange around the edges of the foil, and also keep it dark.  You don't need to keep colonizing jars in the dark, but it's a good idea to keep bulk substrates and casing layers dark during colonization so you can time the major pinning triggers to occur at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to case that, wait until it's fully colonized and then apply a casing layer.  Otherwise, you can fruit it uncased.  At full colonization, place into a fruiting chamber and increase the air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6656584</next>\n<prev>6656400</prev>\n<first>6655355</first>\n<last>6658432</last>\n<when>1173575150</when>\n<utime>03/11/07 04:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
