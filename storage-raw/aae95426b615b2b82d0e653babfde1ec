{"key":"post-8860247","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8860247</id>\n<content>After 35 years of mushroom cultivation, I've learned a little bit about what works, what doesn't, and what &lt;i&gt;works better&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My advice is based on that, and will change as new/improved information and research shows something better, not on what my old friend wrote 15 to 20 years ago based on the state of our hobby at the time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've said previously, grow some mushrooms to learn the life-cycle first hand, post the pictures, try different methods and post the pictures along with the results of your experiments.&amp;nbsp; You're not the first new member to quote Stamet's books to prove I'm wrong, and I'm sure you won't be the last.&amp;nbsp; That's a good thing actually; it shows you're researching the hobby before you start. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/thumbup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:thumbup:&quot; title=&quot;:thumbup:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With biology/chemistry knowledge, I'm certain you understand that the major difference between medicine and poison is dosage.&amp;nbsp; Hydrated(water soluble) lime is a much more potent base than simple ground limestone.&amp;nbsp; Limestone(calcium carbonate) is 'weaker' and needs time to dissolve, therefore is more forgiving of new growers who use too much.&amp;nbsp; Hydrated lime dissolves instantly and is much less forgiving of noobs who use too much, but gives the pH correction immediately while the casing layer is still uncolonized, thus preventing contaminant mold spores from germinating in the numbers that can overwhelm the mushroom mycelium, which is far more tolerant of a basic pH.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy growing to all.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8860737</next>\n<prev>8860013</prev>\n<first>8853832</first>\n<last>8860737</last>\n<when>1220293331</when>\n<utime>09/01/08 09:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
