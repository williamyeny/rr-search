You can probably just leave it partly open.  I have a home made greenhouse with two slits cut from floor to ceiling, plus a few other holes big enough to stick my hands through for ventilation.  A cool mist can easily keep up with the humidity requirements of a well ventilated greenhouse, and the more air exchange, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even have a small air conditioner ducted into my greenhouse for use with cold weather species that require cold shocking.  Right now, I'm maintaining 58F and 90% humidity with two coolmists running three minutes on, three minutes off.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6003355</next>\n<prev>6003207</prev>\n<first>6003207</first>\n<last>6007685</last>\n<when>1156737916</when>\n<utime>08/28/06 07:05 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
