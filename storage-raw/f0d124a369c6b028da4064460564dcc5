Contamination problems are cumulative, thus the more exposures your house has had to mold spores, the more likely they are to infect your future crops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When molds form in sealed, sterilized jars, they were introduced at inoculation.  It's either contaminated inoculant, or bad procedure such as failure to flame sterilize between jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room temperature colonization works great.  I'd get rid of any incubators and colonize in the open on a shelf.  Temperatures much above 80F stimulate molds and bacteria, while slowing down mushroom mycelium growth.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7794888</prev>\n<first>7794888</first>\n<last>7794941</last>\n<when>1198510345</when>\n<utime>12/24/07 05:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
