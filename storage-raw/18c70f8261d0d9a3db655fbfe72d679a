Casing layers are not, and should not be, sterile.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must always assume that contaminant spores by the thousands or millions are landing on your substrate/casing.  That is a fact of life.   The trick is to not give them the environment to germinate and grow.  Stale, still air is that environment.  Moving, fresh air will stimulate the mushroom mycelium, while being less than desirable for molds.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6146233</prev>\n<first>6137973</first>\n<last>6146530</last>\n<when>1160334576</when>\n<utime>10/08/06 10:09 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
