I've got a few cheapies that just sit on the shelf, and never get used anymore.  You won't get quality for less than $1,000 and that's the low end.  A decent C-mount microscope camera is going to cost $2,000 just for the camera.  In fact, the camera will cost more than the scope.  You can pick up a pretty good scope for $1,000 whether you want zoom or light microscope.  I actually use my zoom more than the light in mycology.  The zoom microscope is great for looking at mycelium on petri dishes, gills on mushrooms, and other stuff like that.  If you want to see on the cellular level, you'll need a light microscope and a box of slides and covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a whole section on microscopy filmed for my video, but had to cut it out because there just wasn't enough room on the 2 dvd set for it.  Perhaps it will fit into one of the future releases.  I'm already working on the next one.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6931155</next>\n<prev>6930933</prev>\n<first>6930221</first>\n<last>6932040</last>\n<when>1179444742</when>\n<utime>05/18/07 02:32 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
