Why did that yeild fruits with NO potency? Lack of nutes?&lt;br /&gt;I was simply looking for an answer and now you're being an ass. imagine that. RR's ego getting the best of him &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I beg your pardon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I responded in the Ben's white rice thread, as well as several follow-up threads, and the answer is searchable.&amp;nbsp; I won't type stuff over and over again endlessly for those who wish to argue rather than use the 'search posts' feature to get their answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, nobody had even thought of using coffee.&amp;nbsp; I was the first in the community to experiment with it, and had good results that I relayed here so others could also experiment.&amp;nbsp; I was also the first to use coir as a substrate, and reported my results here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use manure, coir, coffee grinds, etc., as bulk substrates for growing &lt;i&gt;P cubensis&lt;/i&gt;, which is a dung and straw loving species.&amp;nbsp; This thread is about azures, which is a wood decomposing species.&amp;nbsp; If you don't know the difference between the two, please study and learn, but don't flame those who are trying to help, which makes yourself look like an ass, not me.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9103889</next>\n<prev>9103873</prev>\n<first>9103171</first>\n<last>9104369</last>\n<when>1224525258</when>\n<utime>10/20/08 08:54 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
