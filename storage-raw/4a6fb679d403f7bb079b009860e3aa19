You'll send up so many spores your house will be a mess to try to grow in.  In fact, I had a substrate block with some trich on the bottom that I didn't notice untill a week or two later. Two months later, I'm still fighting trich that shows up in my cultures and grain jars, and that's after running my flowhood for an hour before I start work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always toss out green on sight.  You battle trich before it grows by providing good air exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6647709</prev>\n<first>6646716</first>\n<last>6648087</last>\n<when>1173367384</when>\n<utime>03/08/07 05:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
