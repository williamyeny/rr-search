{"key":"post-7757510","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7757510</id>\n<content>For years, anytime someone would say to give an extra week to allow the center to colonize, I'd jump in and try to set the record straight, but I got tired of typing the same thing dozens of times for nothing, so now I only type it once a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the outsides of a jar are fully colonized, the center will be also.  There is far more substrate on the outside edge of the jar(because it has more area) than on the inside, so there's no way the inside would not be colonized as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for waiting a week after full colonization is to allow the mycelium to &lt;b&gt;consolidate&lt;/b&gt; its hold on the substrate.  Until the mycelium digests some of the substrate it has colonized, it will not fruit.  If you birth the day of full colonization, the week spent consolidating the hold, will be a week spent drying out the cake, thus making pinning harder and yields weak.  If you wait a week after full colonization, pins often form within 48 hours of birthing/dunk and roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's just a few of many recent posts I've made stating the same thing. &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/7656057#Post7656057&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/7656057#Post7&lt;wbr&gt;656057&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6856360#Post6856360&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/6856360#Post6&lt;wbr&gt;856360&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6766280#Post6766280&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/6766280#Post6&lt;wbr&gt;766280&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/7499657#Post7499657&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.shroomery.org/forums/&lt;wbr&gt;showflat.php/Number/7499657#Post7&lt;wbr&gt;499657&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7757529</next>\n<prev>7757507</prev>\n<first>7757192</first>\n<last>7757529</last>\n<when>1197647211</when>\n<utime>12/14/07 05:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
