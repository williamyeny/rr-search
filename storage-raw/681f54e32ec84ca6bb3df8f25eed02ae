It's just that having a bit of mold on the substrate doesn't make the fruits from it toxic.  If in doubt, always dry or boil into tea before consuming.  If the fruits are dark inside, they could be aborts that bacteria is growing in.  Those will definitely give you food poisoning if you fail to dry or boil first.  Rotten fruits should be thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5595601</prev>\n<first>5594836</first>\n<last>5596692</last>\n<when>1146899772</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 10:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
