Rhizomorphic mycelium is strain, therefore genetic related.  When isolating strains, isolate rhizomorphic sectors.  Not all rhizomorphic sectors will be good producers, but nearly all cottony sectors will be poor producers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, rhizomorphic mycelium is a good sign that the hyphae have mated.  Monokaryons won't configure into rhizomorphs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6606410</prev>\n<first>6606410</first>\n<last>6606422</last>\n<when>1172367000</when>\n<utime>02/25/07 03:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
