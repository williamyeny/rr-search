Rheostats are for controlling currrent in DC applications.  For a heater you want a &lt;i&gt;thermostat&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since colonizing mycelium creates heat, don't use over 81F.  Room temperature works great.  You won't see anything for a few days, so don't bother looking.  Check on them a week from yesterday, and you'll probably see something.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6622226</next>\n<prev>6622169</prev>\n<first>6621887</first>\n<last>6624881</last>\n<when>1172722912</when>\n<utime>03/01/07 06:21 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
