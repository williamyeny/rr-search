Spawning is simply mixing a colonizied jar of grains or brf into a bulk substrate like manure or straw.  Don't dunk before you spawn.  Dunking cakes is to give them enough moisture to support a flush, and in your case that will come from the moistened manure.   If you get the prepasteurized tenn stud, use it as is unless you let it sit for a month or so.  If that happens, go ahead and repasteurize, but don't sterilize.  Don't use lysol on the outside of the bag.  Wipe it down with an alcohol soaked paper towel if you want to make sure it's clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no spot in PA that is high enough elevation to require extra time in the PC cycle.  People in Colorado above 5,000 feet will add extra time, or they can use a slightly higher pressure to get the same steriliztion temps.  You won't need to.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5644213</next>\n<prev>5640915</prev>\n<first>5636303</first>\n<last>9248747</last>\n<when>1147872753</when>\n<utime>05/17/06 04:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
