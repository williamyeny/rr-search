I cleaned it and put perlite and water in the bottom. I stuck a small humidity sensor in there that is meant to tell you if your room is in the &quot;comfort zone&quot;. I just put a piece of finished wood on top of the aquarium. After a day, its only at 75% humidity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, since fresh air is the number ONE pinning trigger, the last thing you want is a sealed aquarium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, water in the bottom of a terrarium LOWERS humidity and leads to contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, keep wood away from your fruiting environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those aquarium teks are old school from back in the day when home mushroom cultivation was in its infancy.&amp;nbsp; Today, we have developed far superior methods of obtaining proper fruiting parameters.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;, and you'll see humidity in the upper 90s, with the constant fresh air supply that's the number 1 pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9167867</next>\n<prev>9167735</prev>\n<first>9167724</first>\n<last>9172011</last>\n<when>1225559804</when>\n<utime>11/01/08 08:16 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
