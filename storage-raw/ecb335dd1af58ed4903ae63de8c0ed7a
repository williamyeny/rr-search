They often use it to wash the salts from fertilizers out of the fields and they buy it by the ton to spread over thousands of acres. There's always a place to get large bags or totes for cheap if you're in farm country.&amp;nbsp; I know they mine a lot of gypsum in Canada with several mines in ON, but more scattered around the rest of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I live we refer to Canada as&amp;nbsp; &quot;the free world&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just got a whole lot freer here in WA state recently. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/bigjoint.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:bigjoint:&quot; title=&quot;:bigjoint:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17941212</next>\n<prev>17941147</prev>\n<first>17940136</first>\n<last>17941212</last>\n<when>1363059249</when>\n<utime>03/12/13 06:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
