Cotton seed meal doesn't need to break down to become available.  It becomes available as soon as the mycelium consumes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use blood meal because it doesn't do much good unless it's been composted in a pile.  Fish emulsion does no good at all.  Remember, mushrooms are not plants and need to &lt;i&gt;eat&lt;/i&gt; their food to get energy.  They don't get energy from the sun, so fertilizers are useless.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7487536</next>\n<prev>7487488</prev>\n<first>5150228</first>\n<last>25081449</last>\n<when>1191588820</when>\n<utime>10/05/07 03:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
