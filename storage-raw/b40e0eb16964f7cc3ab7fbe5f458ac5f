They will cool too fast, and as the cake cools it shrinks.  When it shrinks very fast, it draws air in from the outside, which holds contaminants that can easily slip through the vermiculite filter.  Refrigerators are FULL of molds and bacteria from leftovers, cheese, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the jars cool at room temperature until they're cool to the touch.  A 1/2 pint jar is not so large that the insides will still be hot.  If it's cool to the touch, it's cool enough all the way through.  Besides, you inoculate towards the glass anyway.  Have your needle against the glass so you can see the spore solution as you inoculate.  This way, the spores germinate and start growing from the edges where they have the most gas exchange, and it also allows you to see sooner if the growth becomes contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6947257</next>\n<prev>6946742</prev>\n<first>6946706</first>\n<last>6947257</last>\n<when>1179767740</when>\n<utime>05/21/07 08:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
