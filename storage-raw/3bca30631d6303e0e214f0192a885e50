When growing out spawn you do not want light you do not want premature pinning if you are colonizing bulk grains for use with casing layers or to spawn to poo or straw or both you do not want light. Why? The answer is simple you want the mycelium to stay in it's vegetative state this is where it grows out linearly if triggered to fruit linear growth slows and stops as it transitions to a generative state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grain spawn won't pin for at least a week after full colonization regardless of light exposure, and you should spawn to bulk right at full colonization anyway while the cells are still rapidly dividing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also disagree on the vegetative vs fruiting mycelium, which is a holdover theory for many ex pot growers, since so many of us come to mushroom cultivation from that background.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mushrooms are 100% mycelium, and if you put pins or fruits on agar, they continue to grow linearly as pure mycelium.&amp;nbsp; In past years I did many side by side tests of colonizing in the dark vs colonizing in normal ambient light.&amp;nbsp; In every case, the jars that colonized in the light produced fruits sooner and with more abundance.&amp;nbsp; Shiitake growers routinely expose substrate blocks to light for at least the last two weeks of colonization in order to get the circadian rhythm established.&amp;nbsp; Paul Stamets, who wrote in TMC to colonize many species in total darkness, now disavows that advice and colonizes all his spawn on open shelves with 12/12 light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it's hard to get away from what works to try something new, but if you'll colonize on an open shelf at normal room temp and ambient light exposure from day one, performance is better and contamination is less. I suspect it's because the mycelium gets a normal cycle established and is healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was making my DVD, the original name I wanted was 'Mushroom Growing Made Easy', so I did a search for the term, and found that lame ass thing.&amp;nbsp; That's why it's called &lt;i&gt;Let's Grow Mushrooms!&lt;/i&gt; instead. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/tongue.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:tongue:&quot; title=&quot;:tongue:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10595555</next>\n<prev>10594481</prev>\n<first>10592239</first>\n<last>10603835</last>\n<when>1246342702</when>\n<utime>06/30/09 09:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
