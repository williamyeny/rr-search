I don't recommend injecting spores into karo water to make an LC.  That method seems to be all the rage lately, but for every success, there's more than one failure.  That's pretty poor odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only make LC's from tested and proved isolated strains.  They are run on agar to make sure they're contaminant free, then the petri dish of agar/mycelium is Eberbached and placed into the nutrient solution under constant stir.  This results in full colonization of the LC within six to seven days.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6109039</next>\n<prev>6106103</prev>\n<first>6106103</first>\n<last>6109351</last>\n<when>1159373135</when>\n<utime>09/27/06 07:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
