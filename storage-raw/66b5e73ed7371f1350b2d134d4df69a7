A given sized substrate can only produce so much finished product, so when you have a nice pinset, they're always going to be smaller than if there's only a couple of pins and they turn into monsters.&amp;nbsp; Total yield is going to be similar anyway, but as said, smaller fruits are better, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium tek&lt;/a&gt; written up and posted on my site for those who don't know what it is yet.&amp;nbsp; There's also a few paragraphs about lighting on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8540279</next>\n<prev>8539577</prev>\n<first>8533504</first>\n<last>11888868</last>\n<when>1213882390</when>\n<utime>06/19/08 04:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
