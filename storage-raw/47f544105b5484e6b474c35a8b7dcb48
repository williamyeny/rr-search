{"key":"post-6949783","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6949783</id>\n<content>It's common if you leave jars for too long, for mycelial metabolites to build up in the bottom of the jar.  It usually isn't a problem if you're going to spawn them to bulk, but I wouldn't use them for grain to grain transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure they smell ok when you use them.  As long as they're white and smell like fresh mushrooms, you'll be fine.  Wetspot is actually a bad 'slang' name for bacterial contamination, which makes your jars stink.  If your jars don't smell like the kitchen trash you forgot to empty for a couple of days, they're ok.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6947206</prev>\n<first>6947206</first>\n<last>6949783</last>\n<when>1179811672</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 08:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
