You use them to spawn into a bulk substrate such as manure or coir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might try loosening the lid 1/4 turn, but without a filter, you're asking for trouble.  Next time, use tyvek or a synthetic filter disk so you can have filtered gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a few searches for 'bulk substrate' and 'casing layer' and read up.  You still have a week or so to study before that jar is ready to be spawned into bulk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6382474</next>\n<prev>6382449</prev>\n<first>6382327</first>\n<last>6383601</last>\n<when>1166457171</when>\n<utime>12/18/06 05:52 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
