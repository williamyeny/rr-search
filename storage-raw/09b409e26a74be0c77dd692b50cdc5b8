I use 60 cc with fine verm and it's perfect.  The mixture should feel dry when you load the jars.  If the jars were totally out of the water, that rules out water from the pc getting in, so they must have been too wet when made.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6771120</prev>\n<first>6771072</first>\n<last>6771145</last>\n<when>1176245086</when>\n<utime>04/11/07 01:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
