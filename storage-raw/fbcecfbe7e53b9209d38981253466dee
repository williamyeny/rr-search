I've been doing a lot of research and I think I have everything planned out for the most part, except for my actual container itself. I plan on doing a bulk monotub grow, and I want to use a cool mist for FAE and humidity. I think I know pretty much how to knock that out, but my real question is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm probably going to have to keep everything in a closet, because that's really the only room I have to do this. I know it's probably not a good idea to do this with a humidifier, as it may end up ruining the closet. Would I be able to put a bowl of desiccant outside of the tub, like on the floor or up on a shelf maybe, to keep the moisture levels outside of the tub at a minimum? Or would the desiccant end up pulling moisture out of the tub as well? I feel like it might end up working properly, but want to know what any of you guys think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chance of that mess working.&amp;nbsp; I'd suggest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/BRF-Pf-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;brf cakes and a shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt; to learn the basics.&amp;nbsp; Leave it sitting on a shelf or table right out in the open.&amp;nbsp; Hiding things is the surest way to call attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18871859</next>\n<prev>18871838</prev>\n<first>18871780</first>\n<last>18871859</last>\n<when>1379786706</when>\n<utime>09/21/13 09:05 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
