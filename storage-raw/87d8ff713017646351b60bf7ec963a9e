Im just trying to find out why other strains are suppressed, and what determines the fruit phenotype when you have many strains present in a given substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search: anastomosis.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strains don't compete, but usually combine into a coherent whole.&amp;nbsp; There can be more than one strain active in a single fruit, but not always.&amp;nbsp; It's more common in nature when there's an established mycelium and then spores get dropped on it to germinate and join the network.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17927031</next>\n<prev>17926655</prev>\n<first>17882602</first>\n<last>17936366</last>\n<when>1362805617</when>\n<utime>03/09/13 07:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
