I'd start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it doesn't matter how long one simmers. Simmering/boiling doesn't cause burst kernels if you soak first.  I've proved this by RAPID boiling for an hour, after a 24 hour soak.  No burst kernels and perfect moisture.  Rye will only hold so much water.  Once it's hydrated, it won't absorb any more.  The key is to soak first to soften up the shells.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7957594</next>\n<prev>7957467</prev>\n<first>7955782</first>\n<last>7957776</last>\n<when>1201748766</when>\n<utime>01/31/08 05:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
