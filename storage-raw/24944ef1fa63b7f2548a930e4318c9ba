There will be 25 sleeves of 20 pre-sterilized dishes.  By ordering like that, I've never had more than a handfull of broken dishes, and those were mostly just cracked along the edges, and were still usable, since all dishes get wrapped with parafilm anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 30 seconds on Google to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fisher.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.fisher.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt; and they have the 90mm X 15mm polystyrine petri dishes I use in boxes of 600 for 48 pounds.  Use the search feature on their website to find them.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6862535</next>\n<prev>6862099</prev>\n<first>6846401</first>\n<last>6866151</last>\n<when>1178125228</when>\n<utime>05/02/07 08:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
