It isn't suitable as a spawn material due to the large kernel size and it's tendency to contaminate easily.  A jar of popcorn will have only 1/4 to 1/3 the amount of mycelium in it that the same size jar of rye or wbs will have.  Remember, the mycelium colonizes the surface of the grains.  Larger kernels mean fewer kernels per jar, thus less mycelium.  The larger kernels also take longer to recover when damaged by spawning, leaving a larger window of opportunity for contaminant spores to land on them and begin growing before the mycelium recovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye, rye grass seed, millet and wbs are all viable spawn choices.  The grain of choice for the commercial mushroom community is rye for a good reason.  It works dependably and the uniform kernel size makes hydration even, unlike the different sized grains in wbs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5769690</next>\n<prev>5769673</prev>\n<first>5769637</first>\n<last>5769865</last>\n<when>1150769867</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 05:17 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
