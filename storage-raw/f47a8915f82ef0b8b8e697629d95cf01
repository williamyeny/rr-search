However, live bacteria will grow very well on brf, as many careless growers have discovered.&amp;nbsp; It has the same &lt;i&gt;greasy&lt;/i&gt; appearance and &lt;i&gt;garbage smell&lt;/i&gt; as when found on grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing we do know is that sterilizing brf cakes at 100C for an hour renders them able to grow mushroom mycelium, provided sterile procedures are followed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether there are no endospores, or the ones that are present are simply easier to kill than grain endospores, remains to be discovered.&amp;nbsp; Rice grows under completely different conditions than rye or wheat, so it's likely the endospores formed on grain crops in a hot, dry climate are better able to survive than endospores formed on a crop grown in wetter conditions, such as rice.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8883405</prev>\n<first>8883405</first>\n<last>8883999</last>\n<when>1220665747</when>\n<utime>09/06/08 04:49 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
