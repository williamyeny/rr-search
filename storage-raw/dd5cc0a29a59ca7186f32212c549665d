Condensation shows there is a temperature differential between the inside and outside of the terrarium, and nothing else.  It doesn't in any way indicate humidity.  One needs a hygrometer to tell humidity.  There is no way around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asking how to judge humidity without a hygrometer is like asking how to know when you're going the speed limit if your car doesn't have a speedometer.  Nobody can answer that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6829073</prev>\n<first>6828209</first>\n<last>6829164</last>\n<when>1177467783</when>\n<utime>04/25/07 05:23 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
