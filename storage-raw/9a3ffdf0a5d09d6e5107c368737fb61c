I've seen others post using storm chasers, they got fruits to grow. I'm going to call the guy and see what he thinks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find that link again, please hit the 'notify moderator' button at the bottom of that post.&amp;nbsp; It's the cartoon train whistle that's right next to the finger with a string tied around it.&amp;nbsp; A mod will delete the link.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That guy has screwed too many people with shitty product and outrageous prices for common strains that he pulled a fancy name for out of his ass to justify charging more money. At least you got your order, but if he knew shit from shinola, he'd be peddling 1/2 pint jars rather than pints, which take more than twice as long to colonize, IF they ever do.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, your jars will finish up and give you some fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9827846</next>\n<prev>9827669</prev>\n<first>9645314</first>\n<last>10148098</last>\n<when>1235088502</when>\n<utime>02/20/09 02:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
