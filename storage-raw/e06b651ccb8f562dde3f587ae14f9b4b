I cased a cube and didn't put into FC until casing was about 40% colonized. This might have contributed to this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the correct method if one is using a casing layer.&amp;nbsp; If it's blue around the edges, it implies the substrate needs to be misted more often to make up for moisture which is evaporating away.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind, an overly wet or dry substrate will both bruise.&amp;nbsp; You can determine visually which is causing your bluing reaction.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14235877</next>\n<prev>14235853</prev>\n<first>14235668</first>\n<last>14254172</last>\n<when>1301940621</when>\n<utime>04/04/11 09:10 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
