My theory is that the smoke particles (be it cigs or pot) grab the contams out of the air and they land on your substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% correct. Those of you who suffered painful ear infections as kids can usually thank one or both of your parents for smoking in the house.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoke particles act like a 'flying carpet' carrying contaminants piggy-back into your fruiting chamber.&amp;nbsp; Generally, mold spores are constantly landing on your substrates anyway and to keep them from germinating and growing we use massive fresh air exchange which stimulates mushroom mycelium and discourages molds.&amp;nbsp; However, to be safe you should keep smoke and dust around your terrarium to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16390531</next>\n<prev>16390375</prev>\n<first>16388451</first>\n<last>18393003</last>\n<when>1339878835</when>\n<utime>06/16/12 11:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
