I'm convinced many growers who think they 'cut away lipstick mold' and succeeded, actually cut away harmless metabolites from their jars.  Metabolites are produced by the mycelium in order to attack competitors.  They're a weapon.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spot was just under one of the inoculation holes in a pf jar, and the mycelium had completely colonized the dry verm barrier, so when it got to where the contaminant spores were on the dry verm, these were secreted in order to destroy the mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first picture is at 40X,  showing that the spot is nothing but liquid, and the surrounding mycelium doesn't change textures or mycelial types.  It only changes color where it's been stained by the secretions, thus no molds are present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next picture shows the microscope/camera combination I took the pictures with.  The ring of light on the liquid is a reflection from the LED light ring around the objective.  Short of going into photoshop and removing it, I don't know how to get rid of the reflection.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/212441515-Oyster_metabolites_1a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-008/212441515-thumb_Oyster_metabolites_1a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-008/212212173-Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_006a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-008/212212173-thumb_Metabolites_in_oyster_pf_jar_006a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6596213</next>\n<prev>6596050</prev>\n<first>6594993</first>\n<last>6596283</last>\n<when>1172125444</when>\n<utime>02/22/07 08:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
