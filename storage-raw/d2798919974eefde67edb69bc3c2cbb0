I've used large hedge clippers before, but what a pain in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I will say again. I have never had a contam with hay. I don't understand why people say its more likely to contract a contam because something is more nutritious. Its not like a contam controls where it goes... It just floats through the air until it happens to land on your work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with hay is the seeds that are in it tend to make an ideal habitat for molds.&amp;nbsp; Pasteurize with lime, to RAISE the pH.&amp;nbsp; I don't know of anybody who uses gypsum with straw.&amp;nbsp; Use gypsum with coir, and never try to adjust the coir pH down, because it's already about a pH of 5.&amp;nbsp; Bacteria is not a contaminant of bulk substrates-Green molds are, and the lower the pH, the greater the chances of trichoderma.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-006/108452877-SEM_of_Straw.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-006/108452877-thumb_SEM_of_Straw.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10103309</next>\n<prev>10102991</prev>\n<first>10098302</first>\n<last>10105700</last>\n<when>1238821127</when>\n<utime>04/04/09 07:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
