As said, heat lowers humidity by among other things causing the humidity that is there to form condensation on the sides, which robs it from the air.  For each 20F rise in temperature, humidity is cut in half.  That's a basic law of physics.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6838298</prev>\n<first>6836644</first>\n<last>6839212</last>\n<when>1177649636</when>\n<utime>04/27/07 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
