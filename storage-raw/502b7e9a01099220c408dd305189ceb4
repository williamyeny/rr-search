Normally I lock for that reason, but I'll let it slide this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, put the fresh mushrooms in a paper bag and they'll stay fresh for a few days, just like mushrooms from the grocery store.&amp;nbsp; Don't put them in a box, backpack, etc.&amp;nbsp; They must be able to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16391422</next>\n<prev>16391373</prev>\n<first>16391012</first>\n<last>16391938</last>\n<when>1339894757</when>\n<utime>06/17/12 03:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
