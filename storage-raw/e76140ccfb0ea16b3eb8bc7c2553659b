It has little to do with light.  Light is always going to spill down the sides as the substrate shrinks.  Remember, you also had light on the top and it didn't pin there.  Light is only ONE of the pinning triggers, but is probably not even the most important one.  Perhaps your casing layer ph is off?  Also, if you mist and then put the lid on right away where the water can't evaporate, it can cause primordia to abort before you ever see them.  The sides of your substrate are protected from the mister.  What casing method/materials and ph control did you use?&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5597481</next>\n<prev>5597466</prev>\n<first>5597410</first>\n<last>5601369</last>\n<when>1146934918</when>\n<utime>05/06/06 08:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
