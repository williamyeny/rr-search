Twice per day is too little to fan in a small container.  Stamets recommends one to four air exchanges per hour, not day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, most mushroom growth occurs in the period of darkness.  24 hour light is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crumbling the cake in my opinion was a mistake.  It had already finished vegetative growth, and now must knit itself back together again. Patience is a virtue in this hobby. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6075297</next>\n<prev>6072164</prev>\n<first>6070632</first>\n<last>6075297</last>\n<when>1158551905</when>\n<utime>09/18/06 06:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
