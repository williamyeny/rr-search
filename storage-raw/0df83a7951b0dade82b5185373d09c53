However, it's entirely possible to inoculate an unsterilized pf cake with enough liquid/mycelium inoculant that the mushroom mycelium colonizes the cakes before contaminant molds, which must germinate from spores, can get a foothold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Advanced Forum guidelines, this belongs in general cultivation.  I'll move it over there for you.  Good luck with your experiments!&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7884325</next>\n<prev>7883214</prev>\n<first>7877789</first>\n<last>7886622</last>\n<when>1200427570</when>\n<utime>01/15/08 10:06 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
