Fully colonized substrates are very resistant to contaminants.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We filter our colonizing jars because sterile, uncolonized substrates will grow whatever lands on them.  There is no reason or need to filter a fruiting chamber.  Aquarium pumps and airstones will not deliver nearly enough air exchange for good results.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7107050</next>\n<prev>7105450</prev>\n<first>7105028</first>\n<last>7109898</last>\n<when>1183092879</when>\n<utime>06/29/07 07:54 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
