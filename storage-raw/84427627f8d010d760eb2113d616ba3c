You need a hygromter.  Humidity is invisible microscopic particles of moisture that are suspended in the air and can't be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drill holes in your tub, even if it means going to the hardware store and buying a drill.  Drill holes in all six sides and use three to five inches of well drained perlite for humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indirect sunlight from the sides is fine.  If you notice them all growing towards the window, simply rotate the terrarium every day.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6888383</next>\n<prev>6888022</prev>\n<first>6887674</first>\n<last>6888478</last>\n<when>1178637634</when>\n<utime>05/08/07 06:20 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
