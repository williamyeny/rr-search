{"key":"post-8658948","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8658948</id>\n<content>I have no idea where all these 'ideas' come from that are posted in this thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Strains of the same species don't 'fight', nor does one 'win' over the other.&amp;nbsp; That's like saying a black woman and a white man that make a baby will have genes that 'compete' with each other instead of 'cooperating' with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Various species may or may not 'compete' with each other.&amp;nbsp; I've seen alder logs in the forest with at least ten species of mushrooms happily fruiting at the same time within inches of each other.&amp;nbsp; If they're 'competing', they're not doing a very good job of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;i&gt;Strains&lt;/i&gt; of the same &lt;i&gt;species&lt;/i&gt; can be easily combined without snake venom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Some strains are not compatible, but most are.&amp;nbsp; If you inject the same cake with two strains of the same species, you might or might not get a cross(regardless, it isn't a hybrid).&amp;nbsp; You may end up with one strain or the other, or a combination of the two.&amp;nbsp; However, there's such little difference between strains that you'd probably never know anyway unless you wanted to send it off for dna testing along with each parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Most compatible strains will 'combine' genetics via a process called &lt;i&gt;anastomosis&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;-- Google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. If you don't know the answers to such questions, please avoid making shit up.&amp;nbsp; It's sickening to see the amount of disinformation that gets spread on this and other boards, and then noobs repeat the BS to other noobs.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8660270</next>\n<prev>8658798</prev>\n<first>8657567</first>\n<last>8661588</last>\n<when>1216582254</when>\n<utime>07/20/08 10:30 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
