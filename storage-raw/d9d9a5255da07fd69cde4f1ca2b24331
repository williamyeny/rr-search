Cut the storebought cow manure by mixing it evenly with coir/verm.  You will end up with a substrate of 33% bagged cow manure, and 33% each of coir and verm.  Mix well and pasteurize.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5681299</next>\n<prev>5681017</prev>\n<first>5680809</first>\n<last>5681299</last>\n<when>1148776048</when>\n<utime>05/28/06 03:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
