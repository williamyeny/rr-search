And I mean ready to use as spawn on that 3rd or 4th day. I have done tons of experimenting over the years and this works the best for me. Good luck.......MM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main danger in too much air to grain jars is drying them out, and premature pinning in the jars.&amp;nbsp; They do colonize faster though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the OP, synthetic filter disks are the best.&amp;nbsp; You can get them pre-cut to the size of the jar lids.&amp;nbsp; There's no need to cut them and glue, which makes it awfully hard to clean them between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use tyvek, get cloth tyvek such as chemical protection suits, or kite building tyvek.&amp;nbsp; Construction grade and envelope grade are different weaves and not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13432262</next>\n<prev>13431489</prev>\n<first>13431295</first>\n<last>13437562</last>\n<when>1288847181</when>\n<utime>11/04/10 08:06 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
