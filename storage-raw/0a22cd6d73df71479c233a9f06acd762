It also looks fairly small for large grain jars, but if you're doing brf tek in 1/2 pints, it will be fine.&amp;nbsp; That's a pretty good price for an electric pressure cooker.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to keep your jars elevated on a shelf out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11099382</next>\n<prev>11099219</prev>\n<first>11098559</first>\n<last>22727525</last>\n<when>1253547896</when>\n<utime>09/21/09 06:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
