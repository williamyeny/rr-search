{"key":"post-8543607","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>8543607</id>\n<content>To prevent boil over, you need to cool the pressure cooker very slowly after the sterilization time expires.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for boil over is that glass is an insulator, so after you shut off the stove, the agar inside the jar is still at 250F, but due to the large surface air exposure of the PC itself, it cools faster.&amp;nbsp; Therefore as the pressure in the PC drops, the agar boils over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A work-around is to use a LOT of water in the PC.&amp;nbsp; I usually fill the pressure cooker with water to half way up my bottle of agar.&amp;nbsp; This thermal mass causes it to cool slower, and as it does, it draws heat from the bottle of agar, cooling it at the same time.&amp;nbsp; Another tip is to allow a few psi of pressure to drop, and then turn the stove back on high for several seconds to stop the pressure from dropping further.&amp;nbsp; Repeat a few times, thus dropping pressure much slower than it would naturally.&amp;nbsp; Practice the above a few times, and you'll get it done without any boil over at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey type bottles with a long neck and screw on caps work much better for agar.&amp;nbsp; You can drill a hole in the lid and then use tyvek, micropore tape, or cut a filter disk to fit.&amp;nbsp; The smaller opening makes it easier to pour, and also makes less area for contaminants to enter as you're pouring.&amp;nbsp; Allow the agar to cool until you don't need a glove or pot holder to handle the bottle with your latex gloved hands, before removing the filtered lid.&amp;nbsp; This will result in less condensation in your dishes, and because less air will be drawn into them as the agar finishes cooling, contamination rates will be lower.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>8543381</prev>\n<first>8543021</first>\n<last>8543607</last>\n<when>1213971303</when>\n<utime>06/20/08 05:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
