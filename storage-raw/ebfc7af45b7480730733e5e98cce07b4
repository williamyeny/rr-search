{"key":"post-6541705","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6541705</id>\n<content>Grains are MUCH more nutritious than bulk substrate materials. That's why they must be maintained under perfectly sterile conditions until fully colonized or they will get contaminated.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edible growers put up to 20% wheat or rice bran into their sawdust/chip substrates in addition to inoculating with grains.  When you fruit a manure or other bulk substrate, the grains/brf you used for spawn is a major supplier of nutrients to the mycelium.  You'll get nowhere trying to inoculate a bulk substrate with liquid culture.  You need the mass of the colonized grains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6541952</next>\n<prev>6541586</prev>\n<first>6541165</first>\n<last>6550103</last>\n<when>1170899980</when>\n<utime>02/08/07 03:59 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
