Some growers case when the substrate is about 90% finished, but personally, I like to let it go 100% before casing, unless there's a stubborn area like in your project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just cover with foil after applying the casing layer until the mycelium starts poking through.  Don't worry about it getting a bit of light.  It won't hurt.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6047424</next>\n<prev>6047195</prev>\n<first>6047195</first>\n<last>6047650</last>\n<when>1157930657</when>\n<utime>09/11/06 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
