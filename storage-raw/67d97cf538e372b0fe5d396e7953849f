You want the sides and top to be clear.  You can cut a window above your arm holes, or just start over with  clear container.  The two arm holes are all you want.  Gloveboxes work by having &lt;i&gt;still air&lt;/i&gt;, not sterile air inside.  A cheap paper filter will give neither.  It looks like you also have a small hole on the left side of the box to fill in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5856408</next>\n<prev>5855568</prev>\n<first>5855372</first>\n<last>5858121</last>\n<when>1152838335</when>\n<utime>07/14/06 03:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
