It works great for our uses and does not contain asbestos.  The mine in Libby was shut down.  You can get a better deal on a 3 cubic foot bag if you'll find an insulation supplier in your area.  I bought 9 cubic feet for $5, which is what the garden and hardware stores charge for the little bags.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5482574</next>\n<prev>5482559</prev>\n<first>5481832</first>\n<last>5484411</last>\n<when>1144259340</when>\n<utime>04/05/06 08:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
