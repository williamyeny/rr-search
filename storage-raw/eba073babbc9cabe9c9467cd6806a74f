{"key":"post-6000948","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6000948</id>\n<content>Fresh mexicana sclerotia by weight is considerably more potent than fresh cubensis by weight.  The rocks are dense and heavy. 20 to 30 grams of fresh sclerotia isn't that much.  It won't be more than half a golf ball in size, which is easy to eat.  They also have a taste and texture similar to almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn't take four months either, although the stones will get a bit larger if you give them longer to grow.  A good strain will begin producing sclerotia at full colonization.  I've harvested them from quart jars after 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do just set them on a shelf and forget they're there.  Nothing could be easier.  I've found that using weak coffee to hydrate the grass seed or rye berries results in faster sclerotia production.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6001104</next>\n<prev>6000588</prev>\n<first>5999281</first>\n<last>6001302</last>\n<when>1156685892</when>\n<utime>08/27/06 04:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
