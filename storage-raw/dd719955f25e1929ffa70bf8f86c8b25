Mushroom mycelium prefers an acidic substrate, and since we pasteurize horse manure and then allow it to fully colonize, it's resistant to contamination.  Therefore, a pH in the 5.5 to 6.5 range is perfect.  I used to add a touch of lime to bulk substrates, but no longer do and performance is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We add lime to casing layers to protect them against molds, since they don't fully colonize with mushroom mycelium.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7513366</next>\n<prev>7513288</prev>\n<first>7513265</first>\n<last>7513473</last>\n<when>1192327331</when>\n<utime>10/14/07 05:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
