Another option is to hang a wet bath towel in front of a box fan.  This will drop the temp another couple of degrees. The ice will also help.  You can freeze several milk jugs, then just rotate them into the greenhouse as needed. I also grow on an upper floor, west facing room and have the same problems all summer.  If it cools off at night, be sure to open your place up so it can cool off inside as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5446523</prev>\n<first>5445379</first>\n<last>5446688</last>\n<when>1143475445</when>\n<utime>03/27/06 06:04 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
