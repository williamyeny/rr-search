However, only being gone for a weekend, I think I'd have just let them grow until Friday, then harvest the young fruits.  They're better quality anyway if the veils haven't torn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they're already in the refrigerator, your plan sounds good.  You might want to leave them in there a bit longer than 24 hours though.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6090676</next>\n<prev>6081694</prev>\n<first>6081694</first>\n<last>6096247</last>\n<when>1158768938</when>\n<utime>09/20/06 07:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
