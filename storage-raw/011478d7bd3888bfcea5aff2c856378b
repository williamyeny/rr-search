People have a right to get paid for the work they do, period.&amp;nbsp; Those of you with jobs expect a paycheck on Friday.&amp;nbsp; If someone hacked into your bank and stole your money, you'd expect the 'government' to get it back for you and arrest the thieves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i undrstand totally, but i bought your dvd. i had previosly downloaded them for free off of your website. if it wasn't for the free downloads, i might never have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are sample clips.&amp;nbsp; I put them there and everyone is welcome to download them.&amp;nbsp; That's why they're there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if it does pass sites like this will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonsense.&amp;nbsp; If a site like this gets notice there's copyrighted material posted, they have ample time to take it down.&amp;nbsp; If they refuse, THEN they get taken to court where they still have an opportunity to tell their side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR uses AOL dial-up internet compact discs to connect to the interwebs. Of course he's not going to mind if these bills pass. It's not like it will effect him negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, now you're just making shit up.&amp;nbsp; I get internet via satellite dish because of my remote location.&amp;nbsp; Dial up is not even available here because it's 45 miles to the nearest hardwire phone switch.&amp;nbsp; Satellite is not a whole lot faster than dialup in speed, but I'd cut off my nuts before sending money to AOL.&amp;nbsp; If you think the only reason I don't pirate other people's work is because I have slow internet, you seriously misjudge my moral character.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15687403</next>\n<prev>15687012</prev>\n<first>15683852</first>\n<last>15691498</last>\n<when>1326984191</when>\n<utime>01/19/12 04:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
