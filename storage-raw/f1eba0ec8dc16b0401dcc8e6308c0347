If a third sector begins to grow from the zone of isolation, it's a cross between the two.  You can verify by placing all three growths on a petri dish and see if a three-way line of isolation opens up.  If so, you've successfully created a hybrid.  Get ready to burn up a few hundred petri dishes before you get your first success, but it's very possible.  The red spore producing cube that is about to go into circulation is a cross between the original Redboy and the PR strain, and the PE6 that is going around is a cross between PE and the Texas strain.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>4772341</next>\n<prev>4771852</prev>\n<first>4770340</first>\n<last>4772341</last>\n<when>1128771212</when>\n<utime>10/08/05 02:33 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
