{"key":"post-6181588","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6181588</id>\n<content>I've grown pans and cubes in the same cased manure tray as a novelty, but it was done by mixing grain spawn from both species after colonization.  Cubensis mycelium is much more aggressive than copelandia and will simply overrun it in a spawn jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have lightening fast colonization 4 days after scraping spores directly into grain jars, my money is on mold, not mushroom mycelium.  I hope I'm wrong.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6181596</next>\n<prev>6181567</prev>\n<first>6181567</first>\n<last>6206731</last>\n<when>1161182229</when>\n<utime>10/18/06 05:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
