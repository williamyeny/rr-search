One difference is they generally take a bit longer to pin than cubes do, and another is they prefer to fruit in the 80's, so they're great for the summer months when our houses are naturally hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, you want a thin substrate, no more than 2&quot; thick.  My best results came from 1 1/2&quot; substrates with a 1/4&quot; casing layer of peat/verm.  Horse manure is great, but I've also had decent results using composted cow manure out of the bag, mixed with a touch of coir and garden compost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provide 80F to 90F at fruiting time and keep the humidity very high.  Wax paper helps to lay over the casing layer to keep humidity at the surface high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I've found the trip from pan cyans to be on the 'dark' side, so I don't do them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7560745</next>\n<prev>7560547</prev>\n<first>7559934</first>\n<last>7570385</last>\n<when>1193365605</when>\n<utime>10/26/07 05:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
