The reason is that more mycelium is created per jar.  As I said above, it works, but if you have access to rye berries, they're the overwhelming preferred choice, with wild bird seed typically a preferred second choice.  Once the grains are spawned to bulk, it's the bulk that supports the fruits, so other than the extra nutrition that the spawn provides, it really doesn't make much difference.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6614240</next>\n<prev>6613293</prev>\n<first>6611968</first>\n<last>6616698</last>\n<when>1172534882</when>\n<utime>02/27/07 02:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
