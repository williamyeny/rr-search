Don't worry about the hot needle.  The first drop of solution cools it, allowing the rest to flow cleanly.  Don't do sterile work outdoors.  Use an indoor room with closed doors, no fans or vents, and a glovebox.  There is NO sterile procedure that is unnecessary.  Jars such as below are a bitch and sometimes happen even when all precautions are taken.  Those are mine, and I understand sterile work.  Don't cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/07-009/255718132-jar_contaminants_001a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/07-009/255718132-thumb_jar_contaminants_001a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6620143</next>\n<prev>6620095</prev>\n<first>6616859</first>\n<last>6620509</last>\n<when>1172687699</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 08:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
