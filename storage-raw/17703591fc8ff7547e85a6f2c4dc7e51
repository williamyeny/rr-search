About one spore out of one hundred will germinate when fresh, meaning 99% are duds.  By one year, that ratio drops to less than one spore out of a thousand that will germinate.  It goes downhill from there.  With multispore inoculation, you often use several million spores, so you up the chances of the few that survive being in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7077823</next>\n<prev>7077230</prev>\n<first>7075627</first>\n<last>7094611</last>\n<when>1182482164</when>\n<utime>06/22/07 06:16 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
