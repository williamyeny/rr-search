{"key":"post-5672253","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5672253</id>\n<content>My advice was for cased substrate as well.  Cakes are no differnt from bulk grows, only smaller.  Never pick pins/primordia between flushes.  If so, you ruin the next flush.  Aborts will have black heads and be obviously dead.  If the pins have normal color heads, they're just sitting dormant waiting their turn at the nutrients the substrate has to offer.  Sorry to be gruff about it, but folks read these boards and act upon what they read.  Bad advice can cause someone to destroy their perfectly good grow.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8070395</next>\n<prev>5672086</prev>\n<first>5671862</first>\n<last>23963717</last>\n<when>1148575747</when>\n<utime>05/25/06 07:49 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
