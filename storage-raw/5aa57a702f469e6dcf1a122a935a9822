Look in the paint section for tyvek coveralls.  They can be cut up to make a hundred or more jar filters for five bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye berries can be obtained from any health food store.  If you just get a small amount, they'll whack you by the pound, usually around 79 cents or so.  If you'll have them order a 25 pound bag, the price drops by half or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peat is the old standard casing mix. Potting soil also works, but often has wood debris in it that is prone to trichoderma contamination. Coir is better used as a substrate unless you mix it 60/40 coir-verm, but is still prone to overlay.  It will work in a bind though, but peat moss stays largely uncolonized, which allows it to do its job of serving as a moisture reservoir for the developing fruits.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6400937</next>\n<prev>6400272</prev>\n<first>6399756</first>\n<last>6400937</last>\n<when>1166930817</when>\n<utime>12/24/06 05:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
