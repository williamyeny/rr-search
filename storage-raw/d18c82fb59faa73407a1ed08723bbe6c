You don't need or want more than that. If the mix comes out muddy, it means you added too much water.&amp;nbsp; Squeeze it out and try again.&amp;nbsp; Other additives such as coffee, coir and straw are fine, but not mandatory.&amp;nbsp; Dump the contents of your morning coffee filter into the mix for an added boost.&amp;nbsp; Make sure any coffee grinds you use have been previously used to brew coffee, so they're already leached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use gypsum at up to ten percent, so your mix of 5% is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER pH balance substrates, so don't use lime.&amp;nbsp; If it's a bit on the acidic side, that's great.&amp;nbsp; Mushroom mycelium prefers a pH in the 5 to 6.5 range, which is what most bagged up cow manure is right out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8696861</next>\n<prev>8696310</prev>\n<first>8694036</first>\n<last>8696978</last>\n<when>1217341409</when>\n<utime>07/29/08 05:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
