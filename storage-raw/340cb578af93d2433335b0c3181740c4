We let Cervantes strain thread slide, and it's spawned all these, just as I was afraid would happen. I won't make that mistake again.&amp;nbsp; The problem is it fools noobs into thinking the name on the print actually makes a shit.&amp;nbsp; PE tends to look different, and that appearance carries over even when grown from spores.&amp;nbsp; However, PE also generates lots of low potency strains, just like any other cube, which it is.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a pure, single sector isolate deserves to be called a strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone tried to print a shiitake or oyster, etc., and sell the spores to commercial growers as a strain, they'd get laughed out of the community for being a dumbass.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, you have to isolate if you want to find the best performing strains, and it doesn't matter the name somebody wrote on the print you isolate from.&amp;nbsp; Cubes are cubes.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11861048</next>\n<prev>11861003</prev>\n<first>11851622</first>\n<last>13296984</last>\n<when>1263946478</when>\n<utime>01/20/10 02:14 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
