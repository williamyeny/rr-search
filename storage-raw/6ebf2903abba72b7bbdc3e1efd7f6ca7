{"key":"post-7485700","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>7485700</id>\n<content>My experiments show a color temperature of 6,000K to 7,500K seems to generate the best pinsets across a wide range of species.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intensity is also a factor, and you can get great pinsets with metal halide, even though its output is still in the 'red' range of around 4,000K.  However, a cost effective/low heat solution is natural daylight fluorescent which comes with a color temperature of 6,500 to 7,500.   Sorry, I haven't tried the 10,000K tubes, but that's getting pretty close to the uv spectrum, and we know that tends to cause problems, especially long term.  Good luck to all.  Don't be afraid to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7485781</next>\n<prev>7485683</prev>\n<first>7485266</first>\n<last>7489403</last>\n<when>1191539947</when>\n<utime>10/05/07 02:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
