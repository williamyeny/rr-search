But, of course, the cakes are filled with water anyways and so evaporation is an ongoing process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaporation is the number one pinning trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, if proper fresh air exchange is taking place, the cakes will dry out in short order.&amp;nbsp; This is commonly misunderstood, mostly due to earlier texts and guides which advised sealed terrariums, or 'a few air exchanges per hour', but such is insufficient for maximum performance.&amp;nbsp; Constant fresh air is superior, and with a constant exchange of fresh air taking place, substrates will dry out in a few hours, require misting to replace that which was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An understanding of this concept is why experienced growers today consistently turn out flushes which would blow the minds of people just five or six years ago.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15461607</next>\n<prev>15461275</prev>\n<first>15460193</first>\n<last>15462816</last>\n<when>1322971024</when>\n<utime>12/04/11 05:57 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
