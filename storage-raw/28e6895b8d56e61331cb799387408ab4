These are mushroom growing books, not specifically psilocybe growing books.  Those I've seen that only show how to grow cubes are lame and inaccurate at best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7549482</next>\n<prev>7548749</prev>\n<first>7548310</first>\n<last>7550551</last>\n<when>1193108593</when>\n<utime>10/23/07 06:03 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
