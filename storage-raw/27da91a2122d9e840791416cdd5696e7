The reason we add coffee to the soak water of grains like WBS or rye is to adjust pH levels mainly, not to &quot;add nutrients&quot; or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly disagree.&amp;nbsp; There's other and better ways to change pH.&amp;nbsp; Coffee has over 200 compounds, and none of us know exactly what in coffee gives the increase in performance, especially fruiting performance.&amp;nbsp; Coffee also makes humans healthier, but nobody knows what compound or compounds are responsible for that boost either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding 'nutrients' tends to slow down growth, but coffee speeds it up.&amp;nbsp; The pH of coffee and brf are roughly similar anyway, so no real change is being made.&amp;nbsp; I suspect it's one or more of the other structures in coffee either alone or in tandem which provides the boost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18543372</next>\n<prev>18542699</prev>\n<first>18474683</first>\n<last>18655299</last>\n<when>1373546053</when>\n<utime>07/11/13 03:34 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
