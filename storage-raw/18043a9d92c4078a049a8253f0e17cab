Don't twist them off because it damages the cake and green mold often follows in the divot left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need a naked cake to soak.&amp;nbsp; You can soak with pins.&amp;nbsp; Use 12 hours after harvesting all the fruits rather than the 24 hours we soak prior to first flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, you don't have to dunk.&amp;nbsp; You can set a cake full of mushrooms in a saucer of water for a few hours if it needs moisture mid-flush.&amp;nbsp; Alternatively you can pile up some vermiculite on top of the cake and keep that soaked.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>19957812</next>\n<prev>19957698</prev>\n<first>19948366</first>\n<last>19957945</last>\n<when>1399551930</when>\n<utime>05/08/14 03:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
