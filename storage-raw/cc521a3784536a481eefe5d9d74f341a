Contaminant spores will pass through a coffee filter like a mosquito will pass through an open window.  Save the coffee filters for brewing coffee unless they just make you feel better, but they do nothing for contaminant prevention.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6483570</prev>\n<first>6482563</first>\n<last>6483737</last>\n<when>1169430952</when>\n<utime>01/22/07 03:55 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
