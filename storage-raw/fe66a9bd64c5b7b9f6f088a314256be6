If it's a mold it will wipe off. If it doesn't wipe off just leave it alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The q-tip test was debunked years ago.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; Mold spores will often not rub off and bruised mycelium often will, giving a false reading.&amp;nbsp; This is at least the 100th time I've typed this.&amp;nbsp; It's extremely easy to tell mold spores from bruising.&amp;nbsp; Mold sits on the surface, while bruising is the color of the mycelium itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's bruising.&amp;nbsp; Either you've handled your cakes too much, or they're dry.&amp;nbsp; Pick them up to test for weight.&amp;nbsp; If they're light, dunk them overnight.&amp;nbsp; If not, they're fine.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10858579</next>\n<prev>10858176</prev>\n<first>10840214</first>\n<last>10864015</last>\n<when>1250262677</when>\n<utime>08/14/09 06:11 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
