This becomes especially true with grain jars that must be opened to insert an agar wedge or other inoculant.  Always wear gloves to protect your spawn from the germs and bacteria under your fingernails that doesn't wash out, then brush your teeth and use mouthwash just before going to work.  Invest in a package of surgical masks.  Dust masks are useless, so be sure to get yours from a pharmacy supply and make sure they're labeled 'surgical'.
