Horse/cow manure, coir, coffee grinds, chicken manure, compost, etc., are all good and even better mixed together.  The more ingredients in your substrate the better, provided all are fungi food.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7383007</next>\n<prev>7381874</prev>\n<first>7381596</first>\n<last>7383007</last>\n<when>1189265860</when>\n<utime>09/08/07 06:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
