What we sterilize for is bacterial endospores, which can be really tough to kill.  Many begin to form new endospores within hours of germination, so if you go too long between boilings, you're screwed. I'd start over and do the three boilings 24 hours apart as suggested in the tek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this method has a very high failure rate, so I'd still recommend using the brf tek.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Many very experienced growers do very well with pf tek, and stick with it even though they're also experts at bulk.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16722826</next>\n<prev>7318516</prev>\n<first>7318247</first>\n<last>16725278</last>\n<when>1187736724</when>\n<utime>08/22/07 01:52 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
