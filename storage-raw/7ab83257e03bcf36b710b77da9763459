Anything over 20,000 ppm will greatly inhibit colonization, and prevent pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of CO2 helps prevent the mycelium from eating up all the substrate during colonization, but too much is going to stall it out.  That's why we use filters on jars and bags to let the gasses exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During pinning, you want a massive DROP in CO2 levels.  This is the number 1 pinning trigger.  If you're trying to fruit in the bag, at full colonization, cut the bag open to release the gasses and allow fresh air to enter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can cut a few slits into the top part of the bag, essentially turning the bag into a mini greenhouse.  I do this all the time when my greenhouse is too full to accept more blocks, yet I have them ready to fruit.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6619786</prev>\n<first>6618958</first>\n<last>6620047</last>\n<when>1172685736</when>\n<utime>02/28/07 08:02 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
