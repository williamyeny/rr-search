There are numerous bacteria that thrive on petroleum jelly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's warmer inside the FC than outside there will be condensation. Remember, your substrate produces heat. With Kilroy's setup, the heat from the light makes it warmer on the outside, thus. . .no condensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation in a FC is actually stealing moisture from your air, lowering the humidity inside.  Avoid it.  As said above, the water droplets falling on your mushrooms is bad as well.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5769776</next>\n<prev>5769008</prev>\n<first>5718240</first>\n<last>5769776</last>\n<when>1150771264</when>\n<utime>06/20/06 05:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
