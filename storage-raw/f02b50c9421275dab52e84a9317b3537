I've posted many times on this subject to try to help clear the misunderstandings and down right ignorant shit I've seen posted here, but little can rival this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have a CO2 sensor?  I do.  Do you have an O2 sensor?  I do.  Do you have a meter that can read ppm of particulate in the air?  I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More BS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What you guys and RR especially seem to neglect in your thought process is that the Earth has huge massive air currents to keep everything balanced out. Convection is constantly churning the air around us, pretty much evenly distributing the CO2 that occurs in the atmosphere all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO2 IS heavier than air, and without any kind of air current to keep it from sinking, it will. An FC is generally a fairly still-air environment, meaning the CO2 is dispersed very little thoughout the air inside the chamber. I'm sure if you had some kind of gas composite analyzer to take a sample of the air lower in the FC, it would more than likely read at least marginally higher levels of CO2 near the bottom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a news flash.  The fruiting chamber I designed has holes in all six sides.  This results in convection and circulation.  It is NOT a still air environment! The mushroom substrates produce heat, and also the lighting that shines through the fruiting chamber produces heat.  These two produce convection. Perhaps if you'd read posts before jumping into shit you know nothing of, you'd have seen that.  Sorry, but this pisses me off.  Don't attack my work because you don't understand the science behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in a so-called 'shotgun' fruiting chamber with holes on all six sides, would you suppose the CO2 &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;drains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; out the bottom?  It doesn't.  It mixes with the air.  I see absolutely NO change in CO2 concentration from the top to the bottom of the fruiting chamber.  CO2 levels are higher than ambient in the room, but lower than they would be in a 'still air' terrarium, as if anyone who has knowledge of the life cycle of fungi would ever make such a thing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your homework before trashing others work please.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7546108</next>\n<prev>7545795</prev>\n<first>7511309</first>\n<last>7564969</last>\n<when>1193066116</when>\n<utime>10/22/07 06:15 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
