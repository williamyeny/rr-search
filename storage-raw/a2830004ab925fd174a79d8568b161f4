If there is any change in intensity, it would be virtually negligible. I wish I had a light meter on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shit-ton of those from doing videography, but they're just filters.&amp;nbsp; They only 'change' the color temperature in the sense they filter out the undesired bandwidths.&amp;nbsp; If they could amplify the correct range, they'd be great but they don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a 6500K, you're damn close to the best artificial light you can use.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16687229</next>\n<prev>16687062</prev>\n<first>16686313</first>\n<last>16687624</last>\n<when>1344793507</when>\n<utime>08/12/12 08:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
