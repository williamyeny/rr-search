With some things (I have &lt;i&gt;P. azurescens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. cyanescens&lt;/i&gt; in mind) I've been told by experienced cultivators that they will grow every year until they have run out of substrate to fruit on. If you continue adding more substrate they will continue to grow indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is correct if you also leave 20% or so of the fruits to drop their spores to refresh the genetics of the mycelium below.&amp;nbsp; If you constantly pick all the mushrooms and add substrate, the patch will fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With cubes, they'll come back if you're in an area they are native to.&amp;nbsp; It's not just the freezing, because I've seen 6&quot; of snow on the ground in Tyler, TX and cubes are everywhere, coming back year after year.&amp;nbsp; Patches I've started in the PNW don't come back, even though Seattle winters are milder than East Texas winters. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13230459</next>\n<prev>13230346</prev>\n<first>13229612</first>\n<last>13230459</last>\n<when>1285166563</when>\n<utime>09/22/10 05:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
