It's mostly used when cloning wild mushroom tissue that is infused with bacteria and molds within the mushroom itself.  You pour the piping hot agar over the contaminated culture until it's completely covered with agar, and then watch it carefully over the next few days.  The bacteria and molds are 'pasteurized' by the hot agar, but in this case, the mushroom mycelium is more resilliant and begins to grow up through the top layer of agar, reaching the surface in 48 hours or so.  Shave off the mycelium with a scalpel as it appears on top without taking any of the agar.  Do this with each growth that appears on top as soon as you see it, preferrably within an hour or two of its appearance.  This tek separates healthy mushroom mycelium from the contaminants.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the transfers, each dish is inspected under the microscope to identify perfect vs imperfect fungi.  The molds are tossed out and the mushroom mycelium is kept.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7012207</prev>\n<first>7011717</first>\n<last>7012647</last>\n<when>1181085052</when>\n<utime>06/06/07 02:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
