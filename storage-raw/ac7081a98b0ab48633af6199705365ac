Mycelium cleans up toxins by metabolizing them.  Other than heavy metals, toxins in the substrate are not conducted into the fruit bodies.  Stamet's example of the diesel oil spill in Washington State that was cleaned up with oyster mycelium, yielded non-fuel contaminated mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've grown on plywood and particle board several times with good results.  The mycelium rips between the sheets, gobbling up the glue first, and then goes to work on the wood.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7666193</next>\n<prev>7665763</prev>\n<first>7661622</first>\n<last>7669146</last>\n<when>1195746135</when>\n<utime>11/22/07 05:42 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
