If yes is there a time window in which lighting should be done in 12 hr increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; Light is a secondary pinning trigger, but it's effects are much more important &lt;i&gt;after pinning&lt;/i&gt; when proper lighting can double or more the size and quality of your finished harvest.&amp;nbsp; Remember, P cubensis will pin in total darkness.&amp;nbsp; You have to be very careful around here with what you read, since new growers often repeat bad info they heard somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply mist a bit heavier if you're leaving for 2 days.&amp;nbsp; I loathe the term &quot;set and forget&quot; because it implies laziness and this isn't a hobby for the lazy, but many growers have placed freshly dunked cakes in a shotgun terrarium and rarely if ever misted and had success.&amp;nbsp; It's not ideal, but it also doesn't ruin your substrates to leave them for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>17178177</next>\n<prev>17177404</prev>\n<first>17171232</first>\n<last>17189425</last>\n<when>1352300023</when>\n<utime>11/07/12 04:53 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
