I think either the black or red ones are intended for outdoor use so are UV tolerant, but I don't know if that makes them heat tolerant or not.  I've just used the six inch long white ones and they work fine.  Bailing wire or stainless steel aircraft wire(which I use) works as well or better because you can reuse it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6184199</next>\n<prev>6183585</prev>\n<first>6183541</first>\n<last>6184446</last>\n<when>1161220048</when>\n<utime>10/19/06 04:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
