What you are describing is a grain to grain transfer.   You'll need to do it under sterile conditions.  The problem is going to be getting the cake out of the jar and into the jar or bag of grains without allowing it to be exposed to room air.   A laminar flow hood is best, but at least use a glovebox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As CC said, make sure these are freshly colonized pf jars, not spent cakes and not cakes that have sat around for a long time, birthed or not.  Fresh spawn works best.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6234100</prev>\n<first>6231102</first>\n<last>6234172</last>\n<when>1162394043</when>\n<utime>11/01/06 05:14 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
