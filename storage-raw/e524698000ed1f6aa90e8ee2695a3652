You want the center of the manure to reach 150F and stay there for an hour.  Get a meat thermometer to take the guesswork out.  Don't use the oven for the obvious reason that dry heat will dry your substrate.  Air is also a poor conductor of heat, while water is an excellent conductor, and your substrate won't dry out if it's in a bag or jars sitting in water.  &lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5603282</prev>\n<first>5592226</first>\n<last>5604139</last>\n<when>1147094565</when>\n<utime>05/08/06 04:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
