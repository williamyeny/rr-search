A glove box is better for this, because it's not blowing shit around. As long as the the contam hasn't spread more than a few mm's I proceed under the hood as normal and as always keep it fast, and cover the dish as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;FT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should never open a contaminated petri dish in front of a flow hood.&amp;nbsp; If I'm isolating away from molds or bacteria, I'll run the flow hood right up until just before I open the dish, and then shut it off, make the transfer and then turn it back on.&amp;nbsp; If you open a moldy dish in front of a flowhood, you'll just blow the contaminant spores all over your new dish and/or work, not to mention yourself and your lab.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13118540</next>\n<prev>13118387</prev>\n<first>13117327</first>\n<last>13122661</last>\n<when>1283102666</when>\n<utime>08/29/10 08:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
