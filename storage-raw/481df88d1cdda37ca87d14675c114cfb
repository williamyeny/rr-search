{"key":"post-6161321","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6161321</id>\n<content>I've printed up to a hundred caps at once on a table, by covering the caps with tyvek coveralls.   I strongly disagree with putting a glass or bowl over the cap as it prints.  That cuts off air circulation, leading to bacterial contamination on the prints you make.  Tyvek covering prevents mold spores from getting to your printing medium, while allowing air exchange to keep the caps from rotting.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6161342</next>\n<prev>6161223</prev>\n<first>6155043</first>\n<last>6164793</last>\n<when>1160663798</when>\n<utime>10/12/06 05:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
