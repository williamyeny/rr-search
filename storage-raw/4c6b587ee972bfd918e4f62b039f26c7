It spreads the mycelium around so it colonizes the casing layer more evenly.  It helps to get a more even pinset. As said, it's not usually done with cubes, but is great with coprinus and agaricus species.  You scrape when the mycelium is first beginning to colonize the casing layer surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can set the tray directly on the perlite.  With cased substrates in a terrarium, perlite is not required.  The casing layer will evaporate enough moisture off to supply the required humidity. With perlite however, the extra humidity allows you to leave the lid crooked for constant air exchange, cutting down on the need for fanning, especially when you're gone all day to work. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5977318</next>\n<prev>5977297</prev>\n<first>5976971</first>\n<last>5977733</last>\n<when>1155961877</when>\n<utime>08/19/06 07:31 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
