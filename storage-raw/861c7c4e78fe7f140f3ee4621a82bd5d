Thanks man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No,&amp;nbsp; the mushrooms did fine.&amp;nbsp; It just gave my wonderful wife terminal cancer.&amp;nbsp; She's just been sent home from the hospital to die because there's nothing they can do for her.&amp;nbsp; Get out of that house or apartment now and don't ever enter it again.&amp;nbsp; Black mold is deadly to humans and bleach doesn't kill it, nor does replacing the sheetrock.&amp;nbsp; It's in the framing timbers and will be until the building is burned down, which is what local codes should require.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16436663</next>\n<prev>16436483</prev>\n<first>16436343</first>\n<last>20310187</last>\n<when>1340663397</when>\n<utime>06/26/12 01:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
