Coffee grinds, coir, straw, worm castings, etc., all make great additives.  If you're using bagged cow manure, a bit of vermiculite will help keep it from compacting.  You can use up to 10% gypsum by volume the amount of manure/compost for a nice boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use one part colonized cakes or other spawn to three or four parts manure.  Just eyeball the measurement.  That will get you close enough.  It's pretty easy to figure a handfull of spawn to three or four handfulls of manure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to correct your nomenclature, that isn't 'casing'.  It's what we call 'spawning to bulk'.  Casing is later on, when you apply a casing layer over the fully colonized manure.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6942891</next>\n<prev>6942844</prev>\n<first>6942844</first>\n<last>6946338</last>\n<when>1179690459</when>\n<utime>05/20/07 10:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
