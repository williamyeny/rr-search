It means not using chemicals in your grows.  I doubt seriously that honey should ever qualify for an 'organic' label because there's no way to control where the bees go to collect nectar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also no fan of using spores to make an LC because it's soooo slow growing and there's no way to isolate healthy mycelium from contaminants.  But, that's a subject for another thread. . .&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6424212</next>\n<prev>6424144</prev>\n<first>6423607</first>\n<last>6424245</last>\n<when>1167932704</when>\n<utime>01/04/07 07:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
