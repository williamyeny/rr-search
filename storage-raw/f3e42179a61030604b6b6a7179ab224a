A petri dish will fully colonize in two weeks or less.  I usually transfer away when it's 2/3 colonized to make sure to get that rapid growth transferred into my grains.   If you let a petri dish sit for a week or two after they fully colonize, that happens.  It proves you have a fruiting strain.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5573585</next>\n<prev>5571206</prev>\n<first>5571206</first>\n<last>5573789</last>\n<when>1146355873</when>\n<utime>04/30/06 03:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
