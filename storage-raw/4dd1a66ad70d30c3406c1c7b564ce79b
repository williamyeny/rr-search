I've also been working on one for a long time, and the last six months, I've been working on mine full time.  It should be out in a couple of months.   It won't be free though, and I'll go nuts if I find it copied and posted online.   People deserve to be paid for their work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't post links to copyrighted material on the  boards.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6230035</next>\n<prev>6229956</prev>\n<first>6229129</first>\n<last>6329973</last>\n<when>1162305506</when>\n<utime>10/31/06 04:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
