{"key":"post-3840349","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>3840349</id>\n<content>I incubate on a shelf at room temperature.  In the winter, I simply run a small space heater in the room.  My quart jars of rye always finish within two weeks this way, so no real need to build an incubator unless the inside of your house is very cold.  As said above, it's best not to use things like xmas lights around cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when something feels warm to the touch, that doesn't mean it's warmer than body temperature.  Your skin is most definitely not 98.6F, but usually somewhere around 80F.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3840362</next>\n<prev>3839826</prev>\n<first>3836626</first>\n<last>3841844</last>\n<when>1109510555</when>\n<utime>02/27/05 03:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
