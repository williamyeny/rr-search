What you want is the stuff they piled up last year.  A year of sun and rain will render it perfect.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to collect the manure on a very dry day when it's been dry for long enough to ensure that what you collect is totally dry.  If you bring damp manure in a bag into your apartment, it will mold.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5562314</prev>\n<first>5560383</first>\n<last>5562326</last>\n<when>1146155490</when>\n<utime>04/27/06 07:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
