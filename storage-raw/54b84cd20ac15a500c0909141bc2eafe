I figured that the air, when not physically circulated, would just sit, and CO2 would stratify forming a layer at the bottom, around the mushrooms/cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is based on the fact that air flows from high pressure to low.&amp;nbsp; There is a high pressure area in the perlite, since it's damp and at a slightly lower temperature due to evaporative cooling.&amp;nbsp; The interior of the terrarium is at a lower pressure due to being slightly warmer because of the substrates and the lighting.&amp;nbsp; This causes a natural circulation that is self sustaining.&amp;nbsp; I've posted the &lt;a href=&quot;/forums/showflat.php/Number/6880451#Post6880451&quot; class=&quot;pp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;engineering behind it&lt;/a&gt; several times.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>9867490</next>\n<prev>9867011</prev>\n<first>9854236</first>\n<last>9907641</last>\n<when>1235632420</when>\n<utime>02/26/09 09:13 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
