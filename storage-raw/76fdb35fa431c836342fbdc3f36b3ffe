Peroxide breaks down within minutes in the presence of organic material such as a substrate, so is ineffective for an overnight soak.  Rinse the substrates under running water both before and after the soak.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6163722</next>\n<prev>6163473</prev>\n<first>6163464</first>\n<last>6164274</last>\n<when>1160705443</when>\n<utime>10/13/06 05:10 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
