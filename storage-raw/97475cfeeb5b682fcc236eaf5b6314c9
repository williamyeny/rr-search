The only real way for 'strain' to have meaning is if isolated strains were exchanged on agar, but that's considered illegal, so talk of spore strains belongs in the strain thread to keep from cluttering up the forum. There are a few genuine strains in circulation, PE being one of them.  However, as I've said before, the fancier the name, the more likely it's just one of the standard strains packaged up with a new name.  Every cow pasture that has mushrooms doesn't deserve to have a new 'strain' named for it, which seems to be in vogue nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this isn't going to become another strain thread.  I'll dump the one that's up there now, and you guys can begin exchanging opinions on a clean slate.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7955062</next>\n<prev>7955043</prev>\n<first>7946995</first>\n<last>7955062</last>\n<when>1201715495</when>\n<utime>01/30/08 07:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
