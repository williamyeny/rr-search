First of all, the polyfill provides almost no filtering on a monotub.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the top just sits there and has a huge unfiltered gap all the way around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO2 does not sink to the bottom.&amp;nbsp; CO2 mixes with the air which is also being heated by the colonizing substrate.&amp;nbsp; The currents are thus in through the polyfill, and out(mostly) through the gap in the lid.&amp;nbsp; The polyfill mostly serves to slow down the rate of air/gas exchange, thus keeping humidity and CO2 above ambient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If CO2 settled to the lowest point we'd all be dead from power plant and auto, etc., emissions.&amp;nbsp; Instead, CO2 can be measured at the top of the highest mountains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18902485</next>\n<prev>18902451</prev>\n<first>18902304</first>\n<last>18902872</last>\n<when>1380390293</when>\n<utime>09/28/13 08:44 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
