That means a 1000 watt lamp running for one hour, will burn 1 kwh.  In most areas, a kwh costs around ten cents.  That means a 250 watt heater would have to run 4 hours to equal a kwh, thus 10 cents worth of electricity, provided it didn't shut off during that time.  A 100 watt light bulb would run ten hours to equal 1 kwh, etc.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6753033</next>\n<prev>6751647</prev>\n<first>6750965</first>\n<last>6754697</last>\n<when>1175820095</when>\n<utime>04/06/07 03:41 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
