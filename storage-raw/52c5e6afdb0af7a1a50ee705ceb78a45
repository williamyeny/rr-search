Certain brands of wild bird seed are second, but still can't compare to rye berries. They're available everywhere I've ever lived.  You won't find them at a grocery store.  Go to a health food supplier or grainery.  I get 25 pound bags of organic rye berries in Seattle for $8.75.  I'm sure they're cheaper in other areas.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>11555562</next>\n<prev>6869695</prev>\n<first>6864893</first>\n<last>11561340</last>\n<when>1178253408</when>\n<utime>05/04/07 07:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
