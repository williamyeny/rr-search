We try to keep questions of suppliers out of the cultivation forum, so it can concentrate on growing questions.  To answer your question, &lt;i&gt;Sawdust Supply&lt;/i&gt; in Seattle often has Alder chips, and always has alder sawdust.  You can probably get them to deliver a dump truck load to your house.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7621496</next>\n<prev>7621082</prev>\n<first>7621082</first>\n<last>7653326</last>\n<when>1194791849</when>\n<utime>11/11/07 04:37 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
