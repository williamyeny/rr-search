It is normal to dunk in very cold water.  The reason for this is to slow down bacteria growth while the cake/casing is dunking, and therefore dormant and unable to fend off the contamination itself.  Use a tight sealing jar, and it doesn't matter how nasty your refrigerator is.  Just clean the jar before opening.  Some use 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of dunking water, but I just use plain tap water without problems.</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>2527725</prev>\n<first>2527678</first>\n<last>2527737</last>\n<when>1081193330</when>\n<utime>04/05/04 10:28 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
