Necessary nutrients will have to be added according to the plant that is to be grown exclusively in cocopeat.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats what happens when you use plant information in regards to mushrooms.  Mushrooms are far more closely related to animals than plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coir is a substrate material, not casing.  If used in a casing, it needs to be heavily diluted with vermiculite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verm is not necessary for a good casing layer.  Peat, buffered with calcium carbonate or oyster shell flour was the standard for many years.  Vermiculite helps but is not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6691741</next>\n<prev>6691700</prev>\n<first>6691534</first>\n<last>6691997</last>\n<when>1174423393</when>\n<utime>03/20/07 11:43 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
