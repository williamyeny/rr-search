{"key":"post-6102745","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6102745</id>\n<content>After colonization, I like to roll the log over so that what was the bottom becomes the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With straw logs, you really should have let it develop a few pins before unwrapping.  Once a few pins form, the sudden drop in CO2 levels experienced upon removing the plastic will generate a huge pinset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you've already birthed the log, keep it at 100% humidity.  Pins should form soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, straw logs don't require a FC.  You can just use the plastic it was wrapped up in to fold loosely over it to maintain a humidity tent.  This way, they can be used on an open shelf without a greenhouse or FC of any kind.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>10178422</next>\n<prev>6102424</prev>\n<first>6101799</first>\n<last>10211147</last>\n<when>1159291283</when>\n<utime>09/26/06 08:21 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
