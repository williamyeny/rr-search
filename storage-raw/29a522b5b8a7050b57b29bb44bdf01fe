If you or anyone has experience/preference for any reason I'm happy to listen and learn,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're fine, relax.&amp;nbsp; It's often going to take more than a few days to see pinning.&amp;nbsp; You don't really need to be fanning the terrarium, but it doesn't hurt either.&amp;nbsp; Mist, and then check back in half an hour.&amp;nbsp; The cakes(and mushrooms once they start growing) should have absorbed all the water and none should be standing or on the walls, etc.&amp;nbsp; If there is, mist less next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's important for the substrate to begin to dry out slightly, and then have this moisture put back in.&amp;nbsp; The changing moisture content is a major pinning trigger.&amp;nbsp; This is why fresh air exchange is so important.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15566176</next>\n<prev>15541430</prev>\n<first>15540580</first>\n<last>15578113</last>\n<when>1324358338</when>\n<utime>12/20/11 07:18 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
