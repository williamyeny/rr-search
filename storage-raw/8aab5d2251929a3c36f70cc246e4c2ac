Mushrooms don't thrive on pure O2 any more than humans do.&amp;nbsp; Plain, fresh air is what mushroom mycelium needs to be happy and fruit prolifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best use for your concentrator is to keep it by your bed for those mornings you wake up with a bad hangover from tequila or budweiser.&amp;nbsp; A tall glass of water followed by fifteen minutes @ 4 liters will flat out &lt;b&gt;cure&lt;/b&gt; a hangover. To this day, I keep the O2 bottle from my welding rig near my bed if I'm planning a major drinking night.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>8787773</next>\n<prev>8787638</prev>\n<first>8774279</first>\n<last>8788531</last>\n<when>1219018061</when>\n<utime>08/18/08 03:07 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
