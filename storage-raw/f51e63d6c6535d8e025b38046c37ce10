Mushrooms are very well known to pop up and grow rapidly after rains.&amp;nbsp; Disregard any comment you read that is so stupid as to defy basic science and ten thousand years of human experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek#lighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Lighting requirements of mushrooms.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>18703254</next>\n<prev>18702957</prev>\n<first>18702508</first>\n<last>18703812</last>\n<when>1376483776</when>\n<utime>08/14/13 03:36 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
