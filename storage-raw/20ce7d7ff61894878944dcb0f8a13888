Copes like 100% humidity to pin.  I like to wrinkle up the wax paper first, and then flatten it back out before using.  This makes a lot of little passageways for air to circulate under the wax paper, while still keeping your very high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pan Cyans fruit on their own schedule, and are generally a bit slower to pin than cubes, so just be patient.  It sounds like you're doing it right, except i would have kept them covered with foil for a week or so before fruiting to let the casing layer colonize a bit more.  Don't try to fix it now though, just leave it in the fC.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6956612</next>\n<prev>6955372</prev>\n<first>6950613</first>\n<last>15651762</last>\n<when>1179933913</when>\n<utime>05/23/07 06:25 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
