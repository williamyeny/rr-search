If I were you I would just make a large SGFC, instead of dealing with that mess. I really don't think that air stone in water will provide enough humidity or FAE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're correct about the silly airstone not providing enough fresh air, but that setup is not overkill.&amp;nbsp; It's drastic underkill.&amp;nbsp; There's no way an aquarium pump will provide proper fresh air, as I've typed thousands of times, but nobody uses the search engine here to find answers anymore. &lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:shrug:&quot; title=&quot;:shrug:&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New growers tend to obsess over humidity, which is a secondary consideration, while remaining totally ignorant of the most important pinning trigger which is fresh air exchange.&amp;nbsp; The OP is worried about not finding a 'humidifier', when he should be worried about enough fresh air to grow mushrooms, which will never happen in a sealed tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;A shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt; can be used with perlite, geolite, pebbles from a creek or from the garden, etc.&amp;nbsp; The idea is to have a surface which is damp that the air can pass from below to the fruiting area, absorbing moisture as it travels.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15321238</next>\n<prev>15321128</prev>\n<first>15321112</first>\n<last>15481323</last>\n<when>1320419839</when>\n<utime>11/04/11 06:17 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
