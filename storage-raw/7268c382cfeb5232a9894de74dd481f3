Keep them dry on an upper shelf and they should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One common mistake people make with rye and wbs is failing to rinse the grains before soaking with HOT tap water.  By using hot water for the rinse and to begin the soak, not only do they absorb water better, but the heat 'pasteurizes' the rye, preventing germination.  Those who rinse/soak in cold water often have germination problems.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7090541</next>\n<prev>7084175</prev>\n<first>7082961</first>\n<last>7090541</last>\n<when>1182645974</when>\n<utime>06/24/07 03:46 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
