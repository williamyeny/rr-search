Casing refers to the non-nutritious layer on top of a substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Quote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you say, &quot;place the casing into the FC&quot;, or &quot;place the tray filled with bulk substrate with a casing layer on top in the FC.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither.  You would say, &quot;place the cased substrate into the FC&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nomenclature that has evolved serves the purpose very well.  The problem is with people throwing around terms they don't understand, which makes it almost impossible for new folks to learn.  I can't emphasize enough the importance of learning a subject first, before trying to teach it to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7855415</next>\n<prev>7855385</prev>\n<first>7848080</first>\n<last>7860334</last>\n<when>1199930523</when>\n<utime>01/10/08 04:02 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
