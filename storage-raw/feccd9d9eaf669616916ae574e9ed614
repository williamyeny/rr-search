The perlite can't do its job if it's sitting in water.  Think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also don't want a tight seal.  If you don't have air exchange, you'll get contaminants without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensation is not an indicator of humidity in any way.  Condensation is only an indicator of a temperature difference between inside and outside the tub.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>5735745</prev>\n<first>5735150</first>\n<last>5736115</last>\n<when>1150001596</when>\n<utime>06/11/06 07:53 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
