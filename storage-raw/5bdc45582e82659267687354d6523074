{"key":"post-5650985","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>5650985</id>\n<content>I've also seen karo carmelize, and that's a fact.  It matters little whether it's glucose or fructose.  It's &lt;i&gt;karo&lt;/i&gt; and it carmelizes.  Perhaps there's levels of carmelization, and the higher temps will &lt;i&gt;fully&lt;/i&gt; carmelize the substance for candy making or some such, who knows.  All I do know is if it has turned very yellow, it doesn't work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I prefer brewers malt and yeast over karo by a mile.  20 grams of malt and 2 grams of yeast per liter of distilled water.  Never had THAT carmelize...lol.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5650994</next>\n<prev>5650978</prev>\n<first>5650628</first>\n<last>5651999</last>\n<when>1148081041</when>\n<utime>05/20/06 02:24 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
