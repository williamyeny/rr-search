A 20F rise in temperature cuts the humidity in half until more moisture evaporates from the perlite.  That is just a fact of physics.  Warm air can hold more moisture, so if you heat it, more moisture is required to have the same &lt;i&gt;relative&lt;/i&gt; humidity.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6894751</next>\n<prev>6894725</prev>\n<first>6893786</first>\n<last>6899180</last>\n<when>1178757011</when>\n<utime>05/10/07 03:30 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
