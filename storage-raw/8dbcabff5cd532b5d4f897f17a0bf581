That's the main problem.  There's no need to keep colonizing jars in the dark, but 400W and larger MH's tend to stimulate pinning early.  It's the high color temperature that does it.  HPS doesn't cause that.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6876250</next>\n<prev>6875659</prev>\n<first>6875659</first>\n<last>6876250</last>\n<when>1178384356</when>\n<utime>05/05/07 07:59 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
