You can get four, 5 lb filter patch bags in a AA 921 by packing it all the way to the top.  That means the large, gussetted spawn bags can be filled no more than 1/3 full if you're going to put four of them in a AA 921, which is what I use.  Shape and configuration of the PC means more than how many quarts of water it would take to fill it to the top.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6584675</next>\n<prev>6583236</prev>\n<first>6583139</first>\n<last>6584675</last>\n<when>1171895075</when>\n<utime>02/19/07 04:24 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
