It will take several mistings an hour apart over a day or two to get your moisture back.  I'd also pour, &lt;i&gt;yes pour&lt;/i&gt; water around the edges.  Wait two hours, then pour any excess back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once pins are the size of yours they won't abort from misting as long as you up the FAE to let them dry off.  Misting, then closing a container up tight will cause them to abort.  Don't allow them to sit wet is the idea.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6621390</next>\n<prev>6620911</prev>\n<first>6620911</first>\n<last>6628355</last>\n<when>1172704103</when>\n<utime>03/01/07 01:08 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
