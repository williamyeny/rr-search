Coir is fine by itself, or you can mix in coffee grinds, worm castings, horse manure, etc.   Inoculate the coir with your spawn, leaving 1&quot; at the top of the container.  When the coir is fully colonized, place 1/2&quot; of pasteurized peat/verm on top as a casing.  When the mycelium breaks through the top, introduce to fruiting conditions.  You can read up on 'patching', but it's an optional procedure.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7405061</next>\n<prev>7404656</prev>\n<first>7399935</first>\n<last>7406463</last>\n<when>1189721504</when>\n<utime>09/14/07 01:11 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
