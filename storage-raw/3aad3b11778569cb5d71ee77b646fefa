The first $100 offered will put either one of them in your possession. The condenser coil on the back puts out way more heat than you get in cool air from the evaporater coil on the front.  They also suck air from your room to blow out the dryer hose to cool the condenser, so they result in a net heating effect, even though right in front of the unit appears cooler.  I've thought about modifying them by using two dryer hoses to the outside so I can draw outdoor air to pass through the condenser, but haven't got around to it.  I bought an 18,000 BTU window shaker from Sears for $250 and it works much better.  It cools the whole condo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it's a myth that you need to lower the temp to induce pinning.  Watch and see.  Don't let them dry out and keep air exchanges up.  They'll pin at a higher temp than they can survive colonization at.  I'm sure many members have projects pinning right now with indoor temps in the 90's.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5891456</next>\n<prev>5891320</prev>\n<first>5891221</first>\n<last>5892920</last>\n<when>1153694690</when>\n<utime>07/24/06 01:44 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
