When you are using&amp;nbsp; multispore inoculation, the genetics of your shrooms will be hit and miss; some big, some small; Although it may all be the same strain. When you start working with clones and isolates you will have more control over the genetics and yields of the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spore print can produce millions of strains.&amp;nbsp; The name someone wrote on it is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; A strain is a pairing of compatible hyphae, each having germinated from two separate spores.&amp;nbsp; A print can have a billion or more spores, thus a lot of potential strains.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16101131</next>\n<prev>16101104</prev>\n<first>16100896</first>\n<last>16216097</last>\n<when>1334673562</when>\n<utime>04/17/12 05:39 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
