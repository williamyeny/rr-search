BUT wouldnt this kind of replicate misting and fanning? it would keep sub moist but also promote evaporation when UH is off.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant seem to dial in a system where RH is kept high but fog is not present. any ideas or suggestions? really struggling with my current grow, any help would be greatly appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, toss all that crap out and build a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shotgun terrarium&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Don't confuse humidity with misting.&amp;nbsp; One can not replace the other.&amp;nbsp; There's no way you're going to properly automate a fruiting chamber, because if you're giving enough fresh air, your substrates will dry out even if you have 99% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use your eyeballs and brain to know when and how much to mist because it's gong to change daily with changes in weather and ambient indoor conditions.&amp;nbsp; Just keep your terrarium in the ballpark for fresh air and humidity, and mist by hand as needed.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15343874</next>\n<prev>15331651</prev>\n<first>15330833</first>\n<last>15344431</last>\n<when>1320618023</when>\n<utime>11/07/11 12:20 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
