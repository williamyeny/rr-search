Begin making transfers at first sign of germination.  Transfer each growth you see to a new dish by itself.  This way the mushroom mycelium develops in its own dishes, and the molds develop in theirs, which can then be tossed.  This is the best procedure for using a contaminanted syringe to get a healthy specimen.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6796591</next>\n<prev>6796347</prev>\n<first>6793961</first>\n<last>6796591</last>\n<when>1176773714</when>\n<utime>04/17/07 04:35 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
