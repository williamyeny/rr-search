Never try to remove green molds from a casing layer as all it does is spread millions of mold spores into the air, ruining future crops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll move this to contamination forum.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6320587</prev>\n<first>6320094</first>\n<last>6320644</last>\n<when>1164898042</when>\n<utime>11/30/06 04:47 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
