NEVER try to cut mold out.  You only make it worse.  If you're on third or fourth flush, you could try salting the area.  The extremely high pH from the salt might hold off the mold to allow the next flush to mature.  If it's prior to first flush, it's toast.  Bury it in the yard in some manure if you want to save it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6727349</next>\n<prev>6726065</prev>\n<first>6724888</first>\n<last>6727349</last>\n<when>1175225662</when>\n<utime>03/30/07 06:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
