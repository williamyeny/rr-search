You did go a bit overboard on the amount, so cut it down next time.  There's still a bit of controversy whether the gypsum is actually absorbed into the grains or not, but one thing is certain:  If you soak in water/gypsum, the grains fall apart later like sand in an hour glass.  There will be no clumping of the grains as long as you also got your moisture content right.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6106608</next>\n<prev>6106418</prev>\n<first>6106418</first>\n<last>6109044</last>\n<when>1159372285</when>\n<utime>09/27/06 06:51 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
