It would take a microscope to identify for certain, but unless you have a good lab to make a microscope slide, it would be a major mistake to even think about opening that jar and releasing tens of billions of contaminants spores into your house/grow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a physical impossibility for grains to reach a temperature above 100C/212F in an oven without completely drying out, and it takes higher temps than that to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really feel the need to save the glass jars for future use, PC them before opening.  Otherwise, toss them in the trash just like they are.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6255286</next>\n<prev>6251939</prev>\n<first>6247935</first>\n<last>6309014</last>\n<when>1162834352</when>\n<utime>11/06/06 07:32 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
