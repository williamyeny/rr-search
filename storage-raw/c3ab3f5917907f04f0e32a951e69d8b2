I'm assuming it has something to do with surface area? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 pints work better for the pf tek.  After birthing, many growers stack two together, but they colonize better in the smaller jars.  The reason is that brf is pretty dense, and in the larger jars, they have a hard time getting gas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6949822</next>\n<prev>6949807</prev>\n<first>6947780</first>\n<last>6949822</last>\n<when>1179812173</when>\n<utime>05/22/07 08:36 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
