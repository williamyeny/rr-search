If the former, that would seem to suggest that the ideal concentration of CO2 is somewhat higher than the ambient ~380 ppm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism fungi use to convert light to biomass remains for future researchers to find out.&amp;nbsp; I do know, as does just about everyone here who has switched to proper lighting, that mushrooms grown with the proper lighting will be double or more in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, with many species, growth in the mycelium expansion stage is also faster when exposed to ambient light.&amp;nbsp; For example, with my shiitake, I can see almost double the rate of growth on the top petri dish in a stack.&amp;nbsp; Temperature is the same for all, but the dish on top which gets more light will always be ahead of those below it.&amp;nbsp; Somebody should try this with cubes.&amp;nbsp; These dishes get low ambient light, nothing direct.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>14118441</next>\n<prev>14117277</prev>\n<first>14114088</first>\n<last>14119652</last>\n<when>1300112942</when>\n<utime>03/14/11 05:29 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
