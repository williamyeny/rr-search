I also think peroxide is horribly overrated for agar work. It does a good job of 86'ing cobweb on a casing layer, but isn't much good in my experience preventing bacteria on agar. I have some oyster and reishi clones that were taken from wild fruits earier in the week that I dipped in peroxide for five minutes before putting on agar and all six dishes are growing bacteria, not mycelium. You can also dip clones into a 5% bleach solution, and get much better results than peroxide for bacteria and mold spores.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5703803</next>\n<prev>5703754</prev>\n<first>5703541</first>\n<last>5708903</last>\n<when>1149270048</when>\n<utime>06/02/06 08:40 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
