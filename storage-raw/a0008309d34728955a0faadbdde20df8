I've used sheep, goat, cow, Llama, Horse, deer, moose, and elk, all with great results.&amp;nbsp; The point being that mushrooms don't 'suck up' bacteria from manure.&amp;nbsp; Any transfer is by direct contact.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal food safety precautions should always be followed, especially when eating things raw.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>12388349</next>\n<prev>12386582</prev>\n<first>12384184</first>\n<last>12388349</last>\n<when>1271202662</when>\n<utime>04/14/10 02:51 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
