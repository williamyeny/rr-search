That's asking for broken jars due to the rapid temperature change.  Load the pc, add the cool water, seal, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; turn on the stove.  This ensures that everything heats evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the weight starts to rattle, turn down the stove until it doesn't rattle at all.  This should occur at about 14.5 psi, which is a great operating pressure. You'll have to re-adjust the stove a time or two because as the jars heat up, they'll absorb less heat. By not allowing the weight to rattle, water loss is reduced, allowing longer cycles if needed.   I use 90 minutes for rye in quart jars.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>7452281</prev>\n<first>7451371</first>\n<last>7452684</last>\n<when>1190762946</when>\n<utime>09/26/07 02:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
