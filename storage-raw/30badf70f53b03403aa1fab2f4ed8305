I gave them a very heavy misting last night before bed to bring humidity up to 99% and try to rehydrate them a bit. This morning the humidity was back down to about 80%, so I have covered up about half the side holes. In addition, I took the cakes out and re-raked the perlite with my hands/fingers to aerate it a bit in case it was packed (preventing airflow from bottom to top and thus lowering humidity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You fixed what wasn't broken.&amp;nbsp; You don't make changes and get pins the next day, period. The mushrooms were going to pin anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untape the holes and provide brighter light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss out any cheap hygrometer, which means any hygrometer you get that says &lt;u&gt;made in china&lt;/u&gt;, because they're only produced to separate you from your money and they don't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no way a shotgun terrarium had only 80% humidity.&amp;nbsp; They'll always be at 95% or greater.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15151636</next>\n<prev>15151564</prev>\n<first>15141190</first>\n<last>15152165</last>\n<when>1317306211</when>\n<utime>09/29/11 05:23 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
