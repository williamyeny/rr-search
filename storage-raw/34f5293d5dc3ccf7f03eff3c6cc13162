Lots of us have tried all sorts of things, and just when we think we're on to something big, the next test done the same way yields a different result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen no evidence that psilocybin is produced in response to stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen no evidence that psilocybin is produced more or less depending on substrate choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen evidence that isolated, high potency strains have less variation between fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen evidence that smaller mushrooms are more potent than large mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen evidence that mushrooms grown in colder temperatures are more potent than the same strain grown in warmer temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No magic bullet has been found that can be added which will cause the mushrooms to be more potent.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13192408</next>\n<prev>13192077</prev>\n<first>13191380</first>\n<last>13196076</last>\n<when>1284439517</when>\n<utime>09/14/10 07:45 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
