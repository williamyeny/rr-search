Not only are they horrible quality, but they're a danger to you as well.  Save up and purchase an All American.   They're at least ten times or more the thickness of the chinese pc's and last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7147904</next>\n<prev>6835821</prev>\n<first>6835733</first>\n<last>7148209</last>\n<when>1177606000</when>\n<utime>04/26/07 07:46 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
