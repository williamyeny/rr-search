The heat forces the moistue into the verm and flour, making it 'look' dry, but it's impossible for them to lose any moisture when surrounded by steam.  The only way they'd dry out is if you removed them from the kettle while still very hot and removed the foil.  If you didn't do that, they're fine.  They &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; look dry.  Wet jars colonize very slowly and are more prone to contaminants, especially bacteria.  Properly prepared jars look dry and colonize very fast.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6823014</next>\n<prev>6822943</prev>\n<first>6821967</first>\n<last>6823038</last>\n<when>1177353101</when>\n<utime>04/23/07 09:31 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
