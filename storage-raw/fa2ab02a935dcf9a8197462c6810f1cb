If the US postal service is using medical tyvek type to made their priority package wrap, perhaps that this can explain why some peoples have success with these tyvek (US postal/medical), when others seem to use some without success (wall wrapping). Only an assumption, I never try neither nor other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;post office tyvek is not medical grade, nor is it suitable as filter material.&amp;nbsp; When it works, it's in spite of its use, not because of it.&amp;nbsp; Post office tyvek is very thin, and distorts in the pressure cooker, opening up some pores and closing off others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use medical grade tyvek, cut from coveralls.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>16078329</next>\n<prev>16077798</prev>\n<first>4623668</first>\n<last>16225123</last>\n<when>1334204807</when>\n<utime>04/12/12 07:26 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
