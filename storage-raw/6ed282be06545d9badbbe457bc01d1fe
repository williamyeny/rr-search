However, also remember that 'sterilization' is never complete unless you pc them for 24 hours or longer which would turn the grain to mush.  The jars should be used quickly or bacteria will take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 5 year old synthetic filter disks from fp that have been used hundreds of times.  They last forever. Just keep them dry.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>4611700</prev>\n<first>4611669</first>\n<last>4611877</last>\n<when>1125677321</when>\n<utime>09/02/05 07:08 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
