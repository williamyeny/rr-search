{"key":"post-6353274","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6353274</id>\n<content>If you have foil under the lid, even the jars with a verm layer are going to suffocate.  I suggest starting over and following the tek next time.  You want 1/2&quot; / 1cm of dry vermiculite on top of the jar, then a lid with at least three 1/8&quot; holes that are for inoculation as well as gas exchange.  Foil goes over the top during sterilizing to prevent water dripping from the lid of the PC or kettle and getting into the jars, but should be removed after sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must raise the jars above the bottom of the kettle.  You've toasted your brf, ruining it and possibly cracking your jars, so check them carefully.  With that many mistakes, it will be a miracle if anything works, so begin plannning for round 2, and be sure to follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6353379</next>\n<prev>6353249</prev>\n<first>6353205</first>\n<last>6396909</last>\n<when>1165753351</when>\n<utime>12/10/06 02:22 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
