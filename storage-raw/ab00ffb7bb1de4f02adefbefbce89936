What matters is that a meat thermometer stuck into the middle of the manure reads 140F to 160F for a full hour.  Some people use a pillow case or ladies stocking and submerge it into the pasteurization bath, then wring out the excess moisture later.   I get the manure to the right moisture content first, then load into bags or jars and pasteurize in a large kettle of water.  Be sure to get a thermometer to use while you get your system dialed in.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next></next>\n<prev>6442653</prev>\n<first>6442189</first>\n<last>6442689</last>\n<when>1168392553</when>\n<utime>01/10/07 03:29 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
