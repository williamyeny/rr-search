Moving, fresh air is toxic to cobweb and it won't grow if you have proper air exchange even if the mycelial fragments land on your casing layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above said, cobweb is super easy to get rid of.  It's killed by spraying with 3% peroxide, which melts it on contact.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6178882</next>\n<prev>6177971</prev>\n<first>6177917</first>\n<last>6181302</last>\n<when>1161100836</when>\n<utime>10/17/06 07:00 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
