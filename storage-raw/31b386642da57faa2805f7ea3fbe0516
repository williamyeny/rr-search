{"key":"post-6733136","value":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<post>\n<id>6733136</id>\n<content>&lt;i&gt;Wetspot&lt;/i&gt; is a generic term that we use to refer to all bacteria, since we're not biologists and can't readily identify one type of bacteria from another. The most common causes of bacterial contamination are in order, the cultivator himself, the air in the room, endospores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We as cultivators are the number one source of contamination.  Our fingernails harbor millions of bacteria, and we exhale millions more with every breath.  It's also in the air all around us.  If you soak for several hours in warm water, then PC for the recommended 90 minutes, you can be fairly well assured that the bacteria came from the air or from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>6733152</next>\n<prev>6733119</prev>\n<first>6726148</first>\n<last>6733152</last>\n<when>1175398051</when>\n<utime>04/01/07 06:27 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
