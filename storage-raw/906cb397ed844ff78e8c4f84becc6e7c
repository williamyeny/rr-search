If it gets really cold, you might put it in an outdoor tool shed to prevent freezing.&amp;nbsp; Azures/cyans will colonize OK at 45 degrees or so, which will help prevent molds.&amp;nbsp; Once the cardboard begins to colonize, add a small amount of alder sawdust and let that begin to colonize.&amp;nbsp; Only after all that, would I add any chips to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once all that is colonized, add more sawdust and chips and mix into the soil in the bed.&amp;nbsp; For best results, make the bed in an area with woody stemmed shrubs, such as Rhododendron, which will provide shade and a compatible companion plant.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15363993</next>\n<prev>15361843</prev>\n<first>15361677</first>\n<last>15363993</last>\n<when>1321154359</when>\n<utime>11/13/11 05:19 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
