The mycelium picks up speed as it grows, provided you're giving the right conditions.  If a jar stalls, don't use it.  Something caused it to stall out or it wouldn't have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, don't use uncolonized grains in a bulk substrate.  As said already, the grains will contaminate in the non-sterile bulk substrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I strongly recommend against using a layer of colonized grains on top of a bulk substrate.  If the grains dry out a bit and the mycelium dies back, you have the perfect environment to germinate trich and other mold spores the next time you mist.  Always cover the last of the grains with a small amount of your bulk substrate material in order to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7689840</next>\n<prev>7688513</prev>\n<first>7687154</first>\n<last>7690061</last>\n<when>1196228041</when>\n<utime>11/28/07 07:34 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
