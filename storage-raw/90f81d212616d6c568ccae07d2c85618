I was wondering if there were some necessary modifications I would need to do to keep my terrarium nice and moist, or if this was somehow a mistake on my part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since fresh air is the number one pinning trigger, your substrates will dry out.&amp;nbsp; You MUST mist to make up for this lost moisture, and the overspray from misting your substrates falls on the perlite, re-hydrating it.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>13926680</next>\n<prev>13926636</prev>\n<first>13925623</first>\n<last>13928230</last>\n<when>1297186688</when>\n<utime>02/08/11 07:38 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
