However, you're also doing a disservice by sterilizing casing material.  Pasteurize it only.  You want the bacteria to survive because they'll not only help pinning, but also help fight the contamination problems you're having.  Fungi spores are killed by pasteurization temperatures, so if you can maintain 150-170F for an hour, trich and cobweb, etc., will be killed off.  Secondly, coir is suited as a compost or substrate material because it's high in the nutes that fungi love.  This means green will grow on it as well as mushrooms.  I recommend not to use coir for a casing material.  For every success story we see, there are many more cases of overlay and contamination.  In fact, straw will do very well when left uncased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the contamination was on the straw itself and not the casing, the most likely cause is it was introduced at spawning when your rye was damaged.  The trich spores get on the rye and germinate before the mushroom mycelium has a chance to recover.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3967983</next>\n<prev>3965330</prev>\n<first>3960661</first>\n<last>3967983</last>\n<when>1111701053</when>\n<utime>03/24/05 11:50 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
