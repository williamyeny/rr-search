There is nothing in molds on a substrate that will make the mushrooms unfit to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, nobody should crumble a moldy cake in their house for reasons already stated thousands of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 'sea of shrooms' tek was written by a noob and was full of errors and flat-out wrong info.&amp;nbsp; That's why it got deleted.&amp;nbsp; The idea of crumbling and casing cakes has long been used, but usually gives no more product than fruiting as cakes, so isn't a good procedure, since it just adds another vector of contamination.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>15066705</next>\n<prev>15066435</prev>\n<first>15063689</first>\n<last>15073643</last>\n<when>1315832508</when>\n<utime>09/12/11 04:01 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
