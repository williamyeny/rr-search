I've never used whole brown rice so don't know.  I would be curious to see if it's also high in triptophan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way...Awesome job on your first grow.  You've obviously been reading and doing your homework.  My first grow was all green...lol</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>3875813</next>\n<prev>3875655</prev>\n<first>3872285</first>\n<last>3879650</last>\n<when>1110099500</when>\n<utime>03/06/05 10:58 AM</utime>\n</post>"}
