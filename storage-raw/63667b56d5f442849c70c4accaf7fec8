It's prepared for animal feed and usually has fungicides placed in it for increased storage life in damp/wet barns.  The same product prepared without fungicides and often grown organically, is available at health food stores and is usually labled 'rye berries'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps certain isolated strains of mexicana will fruit mainly against barriers and glass, but my experience is they fruit throughout the entire substrate fairly evenly.  You'll see from the picture below, the sclerotia that is fruiting formed right in the center of the petri dish.  Quart jars like those shown below, once they've had the product dumped out and the sclerotia separated from the grains, consistantly have 1/2 quart of pure sclerotia.  Bear in mind, that is with coffee hydrated rye berries.  When I skip the coffee or use grass seed, yields are average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'll use rye berries, drying out is not a problem the way it is with grass seed.  I've opened year old jars and they were still ok, and not dried out, but much longer than that and they begin to rot.&lt;br /&gt;RR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/537563591-Sclerotia.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-16/537563591-thumb_Sclerotia.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.shroomery.org/files/06-16/537563581-Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg&quot; class=&quot;highslide&quot; onclick=&quot;return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:192px;height:auto;&quot; src=&quot;/forums/thumbs/06-16/537563581-thumb_Jalisco_fruiting_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>5528828</next>\n<prev>5528406</prev>\n<first>5518974</first>\n<last>8258389</last>\n<when>1145375110</when>\n<utime>04/18/06 06:45 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
