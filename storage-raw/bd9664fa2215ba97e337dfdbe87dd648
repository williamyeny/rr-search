Replace paper towels or wash cloth ones every three days to prevent molds and/or bacteria from growing on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've ran terrariums with a large bath towel soaked, then well rung out and folded loosely, then laid into the bottom of the tub.  Humidity stays as high as several inches of perlite.  People with humidity problems in mini-greenhouses can also hang a damp bath towel or two inside the greenhouse for a great boost.&lt;br /&gt;RR</content>\n<name>RogerRabbit</name>\n<next>7412239</next>\n<prev>7411999</prev>\n<first>7408031</first>\n<last>19727143</last>\n<when>1189861021</when>\n<utime>09/15/07 03:57 PM</utime>\n</post>"}
