Light cycle is most important.   \n> C\n  \nDisregard nonsense like this. Cubensis grows in Texas and Florida in open cow pastures in direct sun.  \nLumens are irrelevant. They're just numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., and mean nothing unless they are delineated over a specific area.(Lux)  \nLux is an important measure because it refers to the amount of light over a given area. We want very bright light. Watts are a measure of power consumed, but not of the amount of light. The reason we say a 13W to 26W is fine for a terrarium is simply based on experience, but that light fixture must be within a few inches of the terrarium to be of much use.  \nMycelium uses light as a source of energy. More light leads to better performance. There is no defined upper limit for light exposure. When I grew in a room with 4000K metal halide 400 watt lamps, performance was better than with 6500K CFL lamps. The latter had a closer color temp to ideal, but the former made up for it with intensity.
