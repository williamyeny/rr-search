I simply place the unmodified humidifier on a shelf in the greenhouse and it works great.  One minute on, six minutes off gives 90% with no drips or other flooding.  An alternative to modifying with pipes if you want a cool mist for air exchange is to cut a hole in your greenouse or martha the exact size for the outlet half the humidifier to stick inside the greenhouse, while the other half of the humidifier with the intake, stays on the outside. Get creative, because within a few months to a year, they fail.  Keep it where you'll be able to go back and get a new one on them.
