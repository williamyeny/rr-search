{"key":"embedding-18958259","value":{"id":18958259,"content":"Endospores are very real and a problem if not properly dealt with.  \nSimmering dry grains will hydrate them, as will soaking. However, if you boil or simmer dry grains, they expand too fast and many will burst. Burst grains spill starch and are harder for the mycelium to colonize. This can and does cause problems later.  \nSoaking grains in hot water hydrates them without bursting. If one follows this procedure, the boil is to get them hot enough to steam dry before loading into jars. Other growers use different procedures, but all of them involve getting the grains to the correct moisture content and then sterilizing.  \nEndospores do not need to germinate to be killed. Stinky, fermented grains will have far more endospores than the original dry grain simply because _endospore forming bacteria will begin to form new endospores within hours of germination._ Simply hydrate the grains before pressure cooking for at least 4 hours. When the grains are hydrated, the hard shell of the endospore is also hydrated, thus it will easily be nuked in the pressure cooker whether it has germinated or not.
