{"key":"embedding-6644620","value":{"id":6644620,"content":"The perlite should stay fully hydrated and provide humidity for four to six weeks. This is plenty for a crop cycle.  \nI simply take the perlite from the tub, place in a strainer and run water through it again to re-hydrate it. You should be able to use the same perlite for years. When I filmed this part for my dvd, I bought a new bag of perlite so it would be nice and pretty white. My old perlite, which is still perfectly fine, is several years old and has been used for dozens of cycles, and is stained various colors from different substrates and spores getting spilled onto it over the years.  \nIf you have a bad trichoderma outbreak, It can't hurt to boil the perlite in a large kettle before re-use.  \nNever set any grow op on the floor. 90% of all contaminants in a room are within 12\" of the floor, and it's even worse with carpet. You need to get a table and elevate it. In addition to the table, I use four 4\" PVC couplings under the tub to elevate it off the table so the holes on the bottom can draw in fresh air. Remember, it's a natural circulation that makes this system work. Even if the terrarium is sitting on a clean table, it needs the holes on the bottom to be open to the air.  \nBe sure to use four to five inches of damp perlite, not the usual two that is recommended with other systems. This is a larger initial investment, but pays off in the end. Good luck to you.
