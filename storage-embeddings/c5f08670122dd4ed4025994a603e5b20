In that case the air is more dense than the air outside the chamber and moves out...the holes. Air with a higher relative humidity and therefor weight defies gravity and moves up? Ever take physics? The Earth orbits the sun\n  \nYes, lots of us around here have taken physics, so we know that humid air is LESS dense than dry air. That's why clouds usually float above us. The heaviest air is when a cold wind brings an arctic cold front. They're usually right on the surface, and if you go up a few hundred feet, it can be ten to fifteen degrees warmer.  \nDense air pushes on less dense air. This is how an airplane wing works. The air passing over the curved surface on the top of the wing has farther to travel, thus the molecules spread out and the air becomes less dense. The air flowing under the relatively flat surface of the bottom of the wing has less distance to travel, thus the molecules are closer together. This results in lift, with the bottom of the wing supporting the entire weight of the aircraft, provided it keeps its speed up.
