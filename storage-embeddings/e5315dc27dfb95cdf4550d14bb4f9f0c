Coir has a pH of around 5 which is pretty darn low.  Trichoderma prefers a pH of 5, so without lime or gypsum, coir and peat are perfect trich foods.  We can get away without balancing coir because it colonizes so fast, but I'd still use gypsum, which tends to set the pH in the mid 6 range.<br />Casing layers should be set to an initial pH of 8 because peat/verm rarely colonizes fully, so you want protection from trichoderma, and a high pH is the best way to do it.<br />For pasteurizing straw, you need hydrated lime.  The others won't cut it. 'Hydrated' means water soluble, so it raises the pasteurization bath water to a pH of around 12, which nukes most organisms.<br />Nobody can say exactly how much hydrated lime to use for casing layers.  My 1 teaspoon per cup of peat is a safe starting point, but the correct amount to use is what it takes to get an initial pH of 8 to 8.5<br />RR","title":"Re: Agricultural
