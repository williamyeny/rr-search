I hope you don't think any part of a tiny planet like ours being closer or farther away is going to make one whit of difference in the intensity of the sun.  \nI think you meant to talk about the angle of various spots on the earth in relation to the sun and the amount of atmosphere the light has to pass through before reaching the surface.  \nTo the OP, if you have commercial mushroom farm, you could vent gasses from the colonizing room to your pot grow, but doing so is going to reduce the CO2 to your mushroom substrates, causing premature pinning. If you try to grow mushrooms and weed in the same area, your buds will all have powdery mildew and other fungal diseases due to the high humidity. Keep them separate except in outdoor grows where they're great together. When I grew in pot in oklahoma in the 1980s, nematodes would destroy half my crop every year until I discovered that dumping spent substrates into the soil would kill off the nematodes. _P cubensis_ and pot grow very well together in the same rich organic soil.
