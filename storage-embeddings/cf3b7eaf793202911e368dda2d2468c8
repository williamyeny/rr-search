(Not potency actual net amount of psilocybin) </blockquote><br />You can only keep a patch going by adding substrate if you also let the mushrooms mature and drop spores.&nbsp; It also only works if you're in a habitat where they'll actually survive the weather extremes.&nbsp; About the only way to trigger fruiting without rain is to water daily and put a big sheet of cardboard over the patch to hold super high humidity at the surface where primordia form.<br />After the veil tears and spores drop, mushrooms begin to die and rot.&nbsp; Pick just before veil tear for best quality.<br
