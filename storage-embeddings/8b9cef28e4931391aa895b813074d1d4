I walk that mile, pulling the product in a wagon behind me to meet the mailman every day.&nbsp; <br />After my whole career living in cities, this was a welcome change.&nbsp; I now wouldn't trade the hard physical work for all the fancy cars and electronic gizmos I used to have, if it meant going back to the city with all the crime, smog, traffic, assholes, etc., that I used to have to deal with daily.<br />RR","title":"Re: Gypsum - Which form is referenced by
