There is no such thing as too humid as long as one provides fresh air exchange. A shotgun terrarium will NEVER have condensation, so it's not an indication of sufficient fresh air exchange.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **TheFog said:**  \n> 1\\. 100% humidity is rain so until you see it pour in your tubs, you're good. Visual cues are more reliable than cheap hygrometers, both digital and analog. \n  \n![:facepalm:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif \":facepalm:\") 100% humidity is not rain. It's simply saturation of the air, not surfaces. Clouds don't form in a shotgun terrarium, nor will it ever pour down rain.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **TheFog said:**  \n> 2\\. FAE and humidity are a balancing act. A very good sign of proper humidity and FAE is drip lines from the condensation buildup in your tub, I believe it was FrankHorrigan that I read that from.\n  \nNo. There will never be drip lines in a shotgun terrarium because condensation won't form in one unless you do something stupid like wrap it in a plastic bag and stick it in a refrigerator!  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **TheFog said:**  \n> 3\\. Mist the walls whenever condensation looks low. Don't mist cakes or perlite, be careful with perlite, you can get pools of water built up, that's bad news. \n  \n![:facepalm:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif \":facepalm:\") ![:facepalm:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/facepalm.gif \":facepalm:\") That's a two facepalm rated reply. Since condensation doesn't form on shotgun terrariums, you don't mist the walls to simulate it. What you **DO** mist is the cakes and perlite. Perlite will never build up pools because it's like gravel. The water will drain right through.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **TheFog said:**  \n> Even better, put a fan in the room aimed away from the tub. Constant FAE, even at that small amount, will yield much more. Keep fanning with this so long as you keep humidity up. \n  \nNever use a fan in the room with a shotgun terrarium. It will screw up the natural air currents the terrarium is engineered to function by. This has been known for a decade.  \nPerhaps you should take a break from handing out advice until you've actually done a grow or two. . .please.
