Others buy plain old cube prints from amateur growers and then make up exotic sounding names to slap on the syringe and call it a strain. Beware. <br />This is why we banished so-called 'strain' nonsense to a bastard step-child of an unmoderated thread at the top of the page as a sticky.&nbsp; Since you didn't specifically ask about god
