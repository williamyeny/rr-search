This is my first post, and I just wanted to say that I use brown rice as well and to achieve a good, uniform moisture content you can just cook it in a rice cooker. It cooks the rice until no extra moisture is present then it automatically shuts off. But anyway, I was wondering if you guys think this jar of brown rice is ready to case. It's amazon strain, and was inoculated on 1/30/09. I know it's close, but some people say wait till all you can see is white. Thanks in advance.<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-007/449677636-SSPX0024.jpg\" class=\"highslide\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this,{slideshowGroup:'hsg1'})\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"/forums/thumbs/09-007/449677636-thumb_SSPX0024.jpg\"></a> </blockquote><br />That jar looks wonderful! That is brown rice? I am thinking of doing a BR/WBS/Rye jar and seeing how that goes. </blockquote><br />Am I the only one that sees pink all over that jar?<br />I keep a bag of whole brown rice as a substitute when I can't get to Seattle to pick up rye berries.&nbsp;  If it wasn't four times the price of rye, it would be a good grain to use.<br />RR","title":"Re: Brown Rice is
