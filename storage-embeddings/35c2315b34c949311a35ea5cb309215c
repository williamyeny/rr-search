farming.&nbsp; Agaricus farms pasteurize their compost after the bacteria break it down at high temperature in the compost piles.<br />I have no interest in making you look dumb.&nbsp; I try to help.&nbsp; If you don't wish to follow what I suggest, then you're free not to.<br />If you don't understand that mushroom substrates produce heat than do a little research.&nbsp; My own underground grow area remains a steady 55F with no substrates.&nbsp; Right now, it has several hundred substrates within, and I leave the window partly open in order to keep the temperature from rising above 70.&nbsp; There is no other means of heat in the farm.<br />I wish you the best of luck and happy growing.<br />RR","title":"Re: A word about
