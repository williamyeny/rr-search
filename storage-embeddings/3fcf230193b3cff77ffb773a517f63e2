I usually get about 25-40% of my pins to goto full maturity, the rest just sit there because their nutrients got cut off by another mushie. </blockquote><br />Wrong.<br />A flush is a 'crop' of mushrooms.  Mycelium tends to send up fruits in groups, then a brief resting period, then another flush occurs.  Flush has nothing to do with picking.<br /><i>quote:<br />\"Once you pick them, clear all the pins off the casing/cake with sterile hands.  Dont worry about taking those pins off, if you have got a full flush those pins arnt going to go anywhere.\"</i><br />If you follow that incorrect advice, all you will do is ruin your project.  Mycelium generally sets all the primordia/pins for the first three flushes at the time of the first flush.  You'll notice that only about a third or so of the pins grow to maturity.  There will be a few aborts that the heads turn black on, but the rest of the pins will be fine and just sitting there dormant.  IF YOU PICK THOSE PINS, YOU RUIN YOUR SECOND AND THIRD FLUSH!   Pick the mature fruits and any obvious aborts, but leave the rest.<br />Dunking is an excellent way to re-hydrate your substrate between flushes.  You can dunk large trays or tubs by placing in the sink or bathtub and allowing the faucet to fill the tub so the water runs over the side and down the sink drain.  Dunk your bulk projects like this for two or three hours maximum.  It doesn't take overnight to dunk a bulk grow the way it does for tightly packed brf cakes.  The running water will prevent bacteria buildup during the dunk.  Cakes can be dunked right in the jar they grew in by filling it up with water and placing in the refrigerator overnight with the lid on the jar.<br />RR","title":"Re: Flushing and dunking
