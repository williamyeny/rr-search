it's being consumed by the mycelium.&nbsp; The book is still being written on fungi, but it's pretty obvious they're not following the same rules as plants and animals.<br />Anyone who has grown with a verm only casing layer has seen it get taken over by not only mycelium, but also by molds such as cobweb and trich that are not in the grains or manure below.&nbsp; Obviously, the fungi is eating the verm.<br />This reminds me of the crap that was posted here five or six years ago when I first put coir forward as a substrate material.&nbsp; Everyone came back and said I must have fallen and
