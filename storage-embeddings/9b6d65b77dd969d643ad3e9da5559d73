I'm going to lock this thread to prevent you from constantly trolling. That cake is obviously contaminated as you've been told by every single experienced grower here, including myself. The very fact that you're a new person on your first grow and refuse to accept the help of those who have been doing this for decades indicates you're without a clue.  \nIf you get fruits from that nasty thing, send me a PM with pictures and I'll re-open the thread so you can call us all tards. Until then, your cakes are made with the wrong substrate, were not sterilized, are OBVIOUSLY contaminated, and you're making a total fool of yourself.
