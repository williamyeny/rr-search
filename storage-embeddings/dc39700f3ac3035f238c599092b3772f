it will contaminate with green molds.&nbsp; Hemp cloth is another alternative, but since hemp is a 'novelty' material, it's much more expensive than it should be.<br />I've been jealous of Pauls place near Olympia for years.&nbsp; I was stuck in a condo in Seattle for the last ten years until this past spring when we moved to a house in the mountains near the Canada border in far NE Washington.&nbsp; I can finally do outdoor mushroom growing, but we spent the whole last summer fixing up our place, and I haven't even taken my cultures out of storage yet.&nbsp; I did manage to haul about ten truckloads of manure to my compost piles though.&nbsp; All of my neighbors have cows and horses, and in fact it's open range, so they're on my property a lot too.<br />I plan to get back to mycology as soon as the snows are too deep to do much else outside, and I'll have a few hundred bags of grain spawn and plug spawn ready to go next spring.&nbsp; My property borders the national forest, so I have unlimited space to work now.<br />RR","title":"Re: some mycoscaping
