The poo is ready to go, and the straw would just be one more step (pasteurizing). What do you think?.Also, what are your experiences with using straw, straight up, 50/50 with poo, or otherwise?\"..................... so we talked about our straw experiences   \n>> another thing your a walking typing contradiction man you go its not like i give a fuck and after we apologize. you send a i hate you letter bitching !! but its all good man GL with your project and if i find any info ill get back to the post ...sorry again for wrecking your show man : /\n> \n>  \n> Bro, like I said, ask a mod, or someone who isn't you if this is a jack, that's all, that's it.  \n> \"After you apologize I send a hate letter bitching, that how I contradicted myself?\"  \n> 1st of all, look at the order of the posts, what are you 15? I said I didn't give a shit when I 1st brought up the jack. THEN you tried to say this was all on topic.   \n> OK, that's when I started to type my post, while I was typing (and smoking), Blutjager apologized then you decided to follow suit. So by the time I posted my response to your jack denial, you had already said \"my bad\".  \n> BTW, This has NOTHING to do with the jack like I keep reiterating. This ONLY has to do with your DENIAL of it. Geez, grow up already.\n  \n> Quote:  \n> **Green2whitethumb said:**  \n> \n>> Quote:  \n>> **_shrooman420 said:_**  \n>> hey man where having a discussion about something you asked about ,on the straw side of the topic ..as far as the poo goes i have never tried it but i have heard nothing but great things but take half your spawn and do it both ways\n> \n>  \n> Something I asked about?  \n> I **never** asked about oyster mushrooms, bread bags, straw logs, mono-tubs, laundry baskets, treasure coast, RR TEKS, \"peeking in\" on colonization in progress, or selling edibles.  \n> This discussion is NOTHING I asked about. Do you even know what a thread jack is? Look it up. Better yet, look at this thread, its the very definition.  \n> Ask someone if they think this is a jack, ask a mod.  \n> Like I said in my post, I don't give a shit about the jack (I've jacked threads, before I knew the etiquette) but don't come back and say it didn't happen.\n  \nObviously, you've already gotten your answer, and you've degenerated your own thread nitpicking. I don't see a thread jack. This is a **discussion forum**, and I'll I saw was discussion.
