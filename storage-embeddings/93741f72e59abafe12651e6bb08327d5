{"key":"embedding-9886218","value":{"id":9886218,"content":"Hopefully I can clear up a few things. You've gotten some good, and some very bad advice so far.  \n1) Duct tape over the holes is fine as long as you remove it after the jars come out of the PC. Foil is better though because it doesn't leave a mess. The purpose is to prevent water that rains down from the lid of the cooker from getting into the jars and making the dry verm filter wet.  \n2) Always remove the foil after the jars cool down from sterilization. Leaving the foil in place causes condensation, which gets the dry vermiculite filter damp, making it useless. You'll have a lower chance and rate of contamination if you keep the verm filter dry. Remove tape from the holes if it's not breathable tape too. Colonizing jars need those holes open for gas exchange.  \n3) Normal room lighting is fine during colonization. In fact, there is a LOT of evidence to show that it helps later when it comes time for pinning. Mycelium has a circadian rhythm just like animals. Expose to normal ambient lighting to help establish this rhythm. The old advice to colonize in darkness is outdated and incorrect. Paul Stamets, who wrote to keep colonizing jars in the dark in his book \"The Mushroom Cultivator\" disavowed that advice and corrected it 8 years later when he published \"Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms\", yet people keep repeating the bad advice 18 years later.  \n4) Use a glovebox or still air box for inoculations. The latter is what is demonstrated in 'Let's Grow Mushrooms'. Never inoculate in open air. Some people are satisfied with loosing ten to twenty percent of their jars to contamination due to carelessness or laziness. I am not. A 1% failure rate is too much. Don't inoculate in a kitchen or bathroom. Those are the two filthiest places in any house.  \n5) Let your jars colonize in normal room temperature on an open shelf. The circulating air will provide gas exchange and keep your verm filter dry. The verm filter catches and traps contaminants before they get to the brf below. When you birth the jars a week or more after full colonization, rinse the verm filter off under the faucet as shown in the video before dunking.  \n6) Next time, use spring or tap water to make your substrate jars. Distilled water lacks essential minerals for healthy mycelium, and also leads to a higher rate of contamination.  \nGood luck.
