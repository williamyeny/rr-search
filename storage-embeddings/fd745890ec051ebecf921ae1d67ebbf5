The job still isn't finished. I'll be working on it all summer. When I finish beefing up the roof, I'll make the soil about six feet deep in the back, tapering with the hillside to about 3 feet deep right by the entrance. The first 20 feet is the incubation area and is heavily insulated all the way around. The back 20 feet is the fruiting area and is only insulated on the roof.  \nLighting will be 100% LED, supplied by solar panels. Fresh air exchange is a passive system I designed(see pic below). If all goes as planned, it will be a zero fossil energy operation, other than substrate sterilization.  \nRR  \n[![](/forums/thumbs/09-21/322691091-thumb_Mushroom_house_077a.jpg)](https://files.shroomery.org/files/09-21/322691091-Mushroom%5Fhouse%5F077a.jpg)  \nThe black and white pipes will create an air circulation via solar heating. They'll be extended another 10 feet beyond what you see just before burial. After insulating with Dow under-slab direct burial styrofoam sheets, the whole container was covered with a hay tarp and a double layer of 6 mil plastic sheeting to keep everything nice and dry.","when":1243569724,"embedding":[0.010064871,0.0033130774,-0.0021616754,0.0014164482,-0.010085524,0.007111499,-0.0034714167,-0.038111575,0.009789498,-0.0035832867,0.011779065,0.009500356,-0.0064299516,0.015062884,0.018656498,-0.0003181845,0.02649085,0.00770355,-0.00021556516,-0.018518811,-0.018876797,0.01349326,-0.014594751,-0.012970053,0.0048018107,0.0047226413,0.023585668,-0.009383324,-0.010209441,0.0054076305,-0.0003065672,-0.009107951,-0.025706038,-0.011304048,-0.029382262,-0.023200147,0.009286943,0.002936161,0.013575872,-0.006281939,0.019097093,-0.00089582166,0.0017864801,-0.019578995,-0.008626048,0.0059721447,-0.01229539,-0.011159477,0.0068120314,0.01803691,0.016178144,0.0062544015,-0.015159265,0.010932295,-0.011496808,0.01974422,0.036018744,0.0032115337,0.0064919107,0.0003050613,0.0020911111,0.006206211,-0.035385385,0.021203695,-0.012942515,-0.009906531,-0.01087722,0.0046056076,-0.005765615,-0.0018260649,0.02529298,0.03235629,0.0097688455,-0.025416896,0.005115047,-0.001097188,-0.0018398336,0.0111112865,0.009410861,0.010030449,0.017568776,-0.033980988,-0.022718245,0.052623715,0.020363808,0.011441734,-0.019813063,0.014525908,-0.009280059,-0.007641591,0.008013344,0.03935075,0.012199009,0.01883549,-0.0191384,-0.0048190216,-0.023805967,0.027082901,0.00866047,-0.044995893,-0.03290703,-0.01893187,-0.0019224454,-0.023709586,-0.022924773,-0.016577434,0.024466861,0.014305609,0.016797733,-0.027661184,-0.0056176023,0.043563955,0.014264304,-0.03717531,0.0018363914,-0.0060237767,0.03411867,0.0077792774,0.005634813,-0.017789073,0.02165806,0.01007864,0.011076865,-0.00669844,0.037808668,0.005022109,-0.01531072,-0.0037140888,0.033072256,-0.0068430104,-0.017871685,0.0112352045,0.012956284,0.0071252678,-0.006664018,-0.0019499826,-0.019620301,-0.019386236,-0.038827546,-0.021189926,0.016949188,0.0047088726,-0.009300712,-0.009128604,-0.009438398,0.019331161,-0.0142092295,0.012770407,-0.0073180282,-0.010966716,-0.002547197,-0.03618397,0.014994041,0.010202557,0.02377843,0.033265017,-0.014484602,-0.0011238647,-0.017981835,0.017279634,0.00018652195,0.0041615693,0.014883893,0.01531072,0.01279106,0.017857917,0.011125055,-0.02377843,-0.003438716,-0.0030617998,0.003266608,0.0060203345,-0.041801568,0.011125055,0.021589216,0.011304048,-0.017100642,0.002134138,-0.010650038,-0.028005399,-0.015999151,0.004027325,-0.0010696506,0.031144647,-0.04604231,-0.018050678,0.020914553,0.008626048,0.011958058,0.004419731,0.0014121454,0.033292554,-0.009479703,0.012811713,-0.62740904,-0.01314216,0.028225698,-0.015737547,0.0034920694,0.008839462,-0.002048084,-0.003913734,-0.013686021,0.0055418746,0.010959832,0.007999576,-0.004405963,-0.00043199086,0.013830592,-0.012068206,0.0032046493,-0.013988931,-0.009032223,0.000046307785,-0.016067995,0.010897873,-0.022332722,0.019771757,0.007676013,0.013727327,0.030043157,-0.007875658,-0.03778113,-0.0065951752,-0.021575447,0.018105753,-0.038084038,-0.0101956725,0.05953557,-0.013582757,0.0067122085,0.019592764,-0.005414515,0.03183308,-0.030153306,-0.0034610901,0.028156854,-0.01590277,-0.028776443,0.006495353,0.03092435,-0.0057139825,0.009720655,-0.019799294,0.025940105,0.012329811,-0.0027244682,-0.0066915555,0.022374028,0.007311144,0.034063596,0.0046434714,-0.0016436306,-0.0012434797,0.004770831,-0.00942463,-0.012412422,-0.015820159,-0.046840888,-0.003352662,-0.049512003,-0.011014907,0.010243863,-0.0026952098,0.011008022,0.016797733,-0.01752747,0.014388221,0.0016229777,0.014140386,0.007545211,-0.0037312994,0.00861228,0.020129742,-0.014594751,-0.005782826,-0.0032820979,-0.008426404,0.0034249474,-0.005070299,-0.003505838,-0.00061270414,-0.009500356,-0.007744856,0.014126617,0.0053835353,-0.001566182,-0.025843725,-0.030235918,-0.0032752135,0.00850213,0.009280059,0.037643444,-0.011572536,-0.01701803,0.002853549,-0.0009784335,0.008453941,0.028528608,0.017265866,-0.016797733,-0.0024473744,0.0249763,-0.01693542,0.0019224454,0.018684035,-0.016880345,0.000017224238,-0.0032235812,-0.032879494,0.031309873,0.00770355,0.0069944654,0.0049911295,0.04282045,0.018780416,0.007090846,-0.010016681,-0.0052940394,0.041939255,0.00987211,-0.037450682,-0.029079353,0.025843725,-0.02326899,-0.0015179918,0.035467997,-0.01405089,0.013458839,0.017458627,0.016425978,-0.01693542,-0.00251966,-0.030235918,-0.02578865,0.012026901,0.011262742,-0.0146773625,-0.027551034,-0.02668361,-0.006030661,-0.0019981728,-0.004715757,-0.0036211505,0.001663423,-0.014649825,-0.020129742,-0.000936267,-0.001087722,-0.009004686,-0.0067948205,-0.028156854,-0.01722456,-0.021024702,0.021919664,0.024838613,-0.02103847,-0.011462387,-0.0021978181,0.0019396562,0.001042974,0.015090422,0.004942939,-0.022346491,0.0058172476,-0.012618952,0.006646808,-0.002500728,-0.021189926,-0.01092541,0.012316043,-0.0017675483,-0.016439747,0.0015954403,-0.009066645,0.008130378,-0.0074006403,0.0025902241,0.012460613,0.0013562103,0.014092196,0.015200571,0.014429527,0.02165806,0.0021616754,0.017761536,0.03213599,0.030979425,-0.011414196,-0.0035798445,0.010553657,-0.01682527,0.0052596177,-0.002
