If you have X amount of static pressure, you will have Y amount of flow, regardless of filter. In place of a filter, the static pressure could be caused by a building, duct work, etc.  However, filter and motor must be matched to get the right performance.  Anno linked to his site where there's some good charts.  This has also been covered in countless threads already, so all the calculations have been demonstrated several times.
