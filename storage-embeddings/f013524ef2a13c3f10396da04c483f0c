I soak in soapy water by adding liquid dish soap to the soak water and then agitate the straw to make it nice and sudsy.  The high Ph of the soap helps to pre-pasteurize the staw and the soap also acts as a wetting agent to make the straw 'wetter'.<br />After the soak, transfer to your pasteurization bath and keep the straw submerged in 140F to 170F water with a Ph of 10 to 11 for an hour to an hour and a half, but don't ever go over two hours.  Any method you devise to meet these temperature parameters will work. A cup of hydrated lime per ten gallons of pasteurization water will get you to the right Ph range.<br />RR","title":"Re: Question about pasturizting
