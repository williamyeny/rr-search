{"key":"embedding-10667994","value":{"id":10667994,"content":"> Quote:  \n> I have experimented a couple different ways. Tried wiping the outside in bleach and/or alcohol first, then inside the glovebox, carefully tearing the stem in half lengthwise like a piece of string cheese, pulling some material from the center, giving that a little fizzy bath in h202, and dropping it in the jar like a G2G. \n  \nThat's not a valid cloning technique. You need to use agar so you can transfer away from contaminants. There's no way to do that when you drop the sample into a jar of grains. All outdoor fruits are covered with hundreds of species of molds and bacteria and you need to use agar. In addition, peroxide weakens the mushroom mycelium, slowing it way down. It may kill mold spores, but fruits from the wild also have live mold mycelium which recovers from the peroxide faster than the mushroom mycelium, thus you defeat the purpose. Don't use it. If you want to dip in anything, use a dilute iodine mix. I don't use any chemicals, but instead make a series of transfers to isolate the healthy mycelium from the molds and bacteria.  \nCardboard is OK for outdoor grows, but you won't be able to transfer from cardboard to grains with any decent rate of success.
