There's no distinct line where mycelium stops and mushroom starts.  \nMost mushrooms prefer an acidic substrate. The problem is, so do molds. We lime our casing layers(when used) to make them less hospitable to mold spore germination, while trying to find the upper limit of pH that mushroom mycelium will still thrive.  \nI wouldn't attempt to lower pH with sulfur or anything like that. Simply use the manure, straw, coir, etc., as it is.
