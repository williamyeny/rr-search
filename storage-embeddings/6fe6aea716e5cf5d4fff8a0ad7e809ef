{"key":"embedding-12696918","value":{"id":12696918,"content":"Heat causes the mushrooms to grow hollow stems, but that's hardly a problem. Mushrooms are mushrooms.  \nHowever, I see no perlite in your terrarium. I'd ditch the humidifier first of all. From the looks of your substrate and mushrooms, I'd say you've waterlogged it. A waterlogged substrate will perform poorly at best, resulting in small mushrooms. If you want an automated setup, put a shotgun terrarium in the middle of a room and you're done. Don't forget to expose to a very bright window, or use a 6500K fluorescent lamp 12 hours per day.  \n_P cubensis_ will fruit well at temperatures which would fry the mycelium during colonization. That's why they fruit well in Texas and Florida when the temperatures are near 100F. I'd worry less about heat since it's indoors and worry more about proper humidity without flooding the substrates, which perlite is perfectly suited for. I'd drill holes for fresh air exchange and get rid of the fans.  \nEveryone seems to want to automate terrariums. The simplest methods of all are the best. Use perlite for humidity and holes for fresh air, plus sunlight from a bright window for light.  \nI also don't run AC during the summer. We open windows up at night to cool the house off, and then close them during the heat of the day to allow our insulation to keep it cool. As soon as the sun goes down, we open the windows back up.
