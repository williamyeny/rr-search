The question is why when I do my straw at 180 it turns out fine. </blockquote><br />If straw gets fully colonized within a few days, it's not likely to contaminate until after first flush anyway, regardless of pasteurization technique.&nbsp; If you're planning low spawn ratios such as we do in commercial production of 1 to 20 or less, you want to be spot-on with your pasteurization.&nbsp; When experimenting at home and using somewhat higher spawn rates, you sometimes outrun the contamination.&nbsp; <br />The idea with keeping temps low is to kill off the mold, but leave some of the heat resistant bacteria alive.&nbsp; Some of these bacteria feed on mold while not damaging the mushroom mycelium, so they're beneficial to have.&nbsp; Others serve as pinning triggers in ways we're still trying to figure out.<br />RR","title":"Re: Pasteurizing
