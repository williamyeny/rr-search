{"key":"embedding-6293765","value":{"id":6293765,"content":"Why not call them what they are? Strains. The definition of a strain is not the geographical area the original print was taken from. That's marketing.  \nAs for cloning vs strain isolation, they're not related. By the time a substrate fruits, hundreds or perhaps thousands of strains have exchanged DNA, either weakening or strengthening the mass. What you get is a 'heinz 57' that may or may not be that great because the weaker genes and the stronger genes(mycelium) have all combined. An example would be mixed breed dogs. We've all seen good examples and others that are dumber then hell.  \nStrain isolation on agar begins when the spores first start to germinate. I make the first transfers as soon as I can see mycelium growing from the point of inoculation, long before sectoring can be detected. By doing this, and by continuing to separate each individual growth, you can isolate mycelium prior to the process of anastomosis combining dikaryons into a single mass.  \nYou don't isolate looking for one super rhizomorphic strain. You isolate down to single sectors and then fruit out each one to determine the best performer. When you transfer mycelium to a grain master, the original petri dish the mycelium was taken from is placed into a clean refrigerator. By doing this, when you find the best performing strain, you then go back to your well marked petri dishes, thus your original P1 culture. This petri dish can be used to inoculate a few test tube slants that can be incubated for a week, then placed in cold storage. Whenever you need mycelium, a tiny piece the size of a grain of rice can be taken from the test tube and put on agar to grow out, while the test tube is placed back into the refrigerator. These stored test tube cultures preserve the low P value of your isolated strain for years.  \nI have a complete video tek on strain isolation and master slant preparation and use already filmed. I'll release it when I get the rest of the teks filmed, and editing completed. Hopefully soon.
