cultivator RR</blockquote><br />And I'm starting to feel really sorry for your journeyman.&nbsp; <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/nono.gif\" alt=\":nono:\" title=\":nono:\"/><br />I had an apprentice like you once.&nbsp; His previous two journeymen had sent him back to the union hall for arguing all the time rather than trying to learn.&nbsp; I was the oldest journeyman on the job so told the steward I'd take the kid, because after raising four of my own, I had the patience of a saint.&nbsp; Two weeks was all I could take before washing my hands of him, and he was kicked out of the program.&nbsp; You only get two chances and the third journeyman to fire you is your last straw.<br />Electrical equipment must be listed for the use.&nbsp; A ceiling fan dimmer is not listed as a motor speed controller.&nbsp; They don't give the horsepower rating, which is required for motor speed controllers.&nbsp; A ceiling fan dimmer is also not a VFD.&nbsp; As for your Jurassic Park analogy, varicones are still used to this day in brand new data centers to maintain positive pressure in buildings with hundreds of thousands of square feet.&nbsp; When the varicone closes, the amperage of the BLOWER motor is reduced.&nbsp; Squirrel cage blowers are not fans.&nbsp; You need to learn the distinction before you embarrass yourself further.&nbsp;  <br />Just because you say it will work on 90% of the motors out there does not mean it will.&nbsp; However, to humor you perhaps he doesn't want to find out if his is one of the ten percent of the motors that will burn up.&nbsp; <br />You should also be aware of an 'electrician' in NY a few years ago who hooked up a dimmer switch to a 'non rated' ceiling fan.&nbsp; He tested it and it worked, so he left the house.&nbsp; A few hours later, the fan overheated and shorted out, catching the house on fire and killed two children.&nbsp; He was charged with 2nd degree murder, later reduced to manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison.&nbsp; He also has to live with the fact that he killed two kids.&nbsp; Electricity is not to be fooled with and it's the reason we have codes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Need help building a
