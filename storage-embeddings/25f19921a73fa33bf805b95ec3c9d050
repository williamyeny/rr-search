{"key":"embedding-9927824","value":{"id":9927824,"content":"> Quote:  \n> It is usually around 0 degrees Fahrenheit where I am, and where I live is very poorly insulated. The school compensates by keeping the heat blasting, so our house is so dry that if you touch anything you get shocked (even water from the tap shocks us regularly), and the relative humidity is literally around 8%. \n  \nToday, the high temp is 0F where I live. Last night it got down to -28F. I use a wood stove for heat, and a Kaz cool mist running in the living room keeps the humidity at 30%, which is fine. You MUST run a humidifier in the winter if you want your home to be warm and cozy. Humid air holds heat much better than dry air.  \nYou should NEVER get shocked from touching metal in your house. If you do, it means you need to get the humidity up. If necessary, take a watering pail and water your carpet, mop the kitchen floor, and spray water on your walls to get the humidity up. Then, simply run a cool mist humidifier to keep it high. Don't tape or otherwise restrict the holes on a shotgun terrarium. You NEED that air flow to create humidity, and also to serve as a pinning trigger. The answer is to raise the ambient humidity in your house.
