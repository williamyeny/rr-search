I have never made an attempt to keep the bags from touching the sides, and have never once had a bag melt.  Perhaps if you have a poorly adjusted gas burner where the flame is curling around the bottom and going up the sides, it could be a problem, but for a normally adjusted burner, or electric stove, the bags won't melt if up aginst the edges.  Bear in mind, I'm talking about commercial mushroom spawn bags, purchased from a reputable dealer, not home made ones using oven bags.<br />It's important to place jar lids or some other spacer between the bags to separate them.  I also drop a single jar lid between the side of the PC and the sides of the bag where it touches in order to allow steam to penetrate nearly all around the bags.  The corners of the bags are still up against the side of the PC.<br />It also helps when using spawn bags in a non-sterile home environment to place a length of cloth or tyvek inside the bag that reaches from the top of the substrate to the top of the bag.  By folding the bag with the tyvek along the folds, it allows for a path for steam to escape, while filtering the incoming air as the PC cools and air/contaminants are drawn in from outside.  These contaminants entering the non-sealed bags are a major cause of contamination, and they occur before the bags have even been removed from the PC.<br />There is no need to PC anything in a AA 930, 921, etc., for more than 90 minutes.   The four hour PC times Stamets describes in his books are for when you have substrate bags stacked five or six deep and it takes that long for the center to warm up.  With four large bags stuffed into a 930 with spacers between the bags, 90 minutes is enough for complete sterilization.<br />Another important consideration when using bags is that because they hold more material, you prepare the contents drier then you would for use in smaller jars.  If you load wet grains into a filter patch bag, it's almost a guarantee of failure.<br />In addition, many growers still fail to put a plenum of fresh air into bags prior to sealing.  For the filter patch to be able to exchange gasses, the bag needs to be partially inflated.  I've seen many pictures posted on the boards asking for help with stalled colonization, and the top of the bag was rolled up tight like a scroll, and that's exactly why the mycelium stalled.  It ran out of air.<br />RR","title":"Re: AA930 Spawn bag
