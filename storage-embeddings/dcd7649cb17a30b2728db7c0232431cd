Whether it comes from a lamp or the sun makes little difference indoors. Most mushrooms in nature fruit in areas where they get at least some direct sun each day.&nbsp; <br />For those of you using artificial lighting, look for 6500 kelvin color temperature.&nbsp; It's proved best for mushroom growing.<br />RR","title":"Re: artificial light, or direct/indirect light (from the
