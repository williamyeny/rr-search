Outdoors, there's a balance of nature so it works fine.  \nFor those of you getting tired of the heat, I'll rub it in a little. We've yet to hit 80F so far this spring, and the day before yesterday, we finally let the fire in the wood stove go out. Today, the high was only 60F, which is perfect for the hiking and mountain climbing I try to do a few times a week. I could never go back to living in a hot climate. ![:laugh:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/laugh.gif \":laugh:\")
