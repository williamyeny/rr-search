those mold spores under cover where they're protected and have a better chance of germinating.<br />I use a 1:20 spawn to bulk ratio in my <a

texture and moisture content of the bulk substrate is right, it will colonize fast.&nbsp; Remember, once the mycelium starts growing, it picks up speed daily.&nbsp; It makes little difference in time to fully colonize using a 1:10 rate or a 1:20 rate.&nbsp; One can gain a few days earlier colonization by using a 1:2 or whatever, but as long as the substrate was properly sterilized or pasteurized, it's not necessary and a waste of spawn which would be better used to inoculate more bulk substrates instead of overloading just the one.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can you add more spawn after its started
