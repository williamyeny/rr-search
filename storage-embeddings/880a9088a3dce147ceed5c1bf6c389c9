Just use high spectrum fluorescent bulb (daylight) for at least eight hours a day. Anything more than 8 isnt beneficial. You just telling the mushies to grow upward.\n  \nThis is incorrect. While mycelium doesn't convert light to energy by the same method plants do, mycelium DOES use light to convert sugars in the substrate to ATP within the cells to produce energy.  \nLight has nothing to do with telling mushrooms to grow upward. They'll do that in total darkness. Mushrooms grow towards light because they're deriving energy from it, thus they turn so the tops of the caps are facing the light for maximum absorption.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **sk81681 said:**  \n> they need complete darkness until you are ready to fruit. \n  \nNo, they don't. It's best to colonize jars exposed to normal ambient room light from day one. This helps to establish the circadian rhythm of day/night which will help later. In addition, low levels of ambient lighting speed up colonization. Keep colonizing mycelium out of direct sunlight, but not in darkness, which is outdated information, long since proved false.
