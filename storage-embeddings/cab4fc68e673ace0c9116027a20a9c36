{"key":"embedding-10104522","value":{"id":10104522,"content":"There's so much bullshit wrong info info in this thread I can't touch it all.  \nUse hydrated lime at one TEAspoon per cup of peat as I've posted here repeatedly. A quart has two cups, therefore you use two teaspoons of hydrated lime per quart. You used more than twice the recommended amount.  \nGypsum is NOT a long term buffer. In fact, it's not a buffer at all since it doesn't change pH to a noticeable degree. Gypsum supplies calcium and sulfur, two elements essential to good fruit formation.  \n  \n_There is no use for long-term buffers such as crushed limestone in a casing layer_, despite what you read in published books to the contrary. Long term buffers are for the garden outdoors where you're growing plants all summer. In mycology, the life of a casing is measured in weeks, therefore there is only a need for immediate pH correction, which is why we use hydrated lime since it's water soluble and begins to work right away. Advice that it is too 'hot' or not to use it is flat-out wrong.  \nDouble up on your peat and your pH should be around 8 which is where you want it at the start. It should also be noted that if you're using a bulk substrate and growing cubensis, no casing layer is needed anyway.
