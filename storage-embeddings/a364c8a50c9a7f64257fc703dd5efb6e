{"key":"embedding-11499856","value":{"id":11499856,"content":"> Quote:  \n> \"thus cool air is at a slightly higher pressure than warm air\"  \n> This is not true. Just check the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. Pressure and Temperature are proportional, if one goes up, so does the other.\n  \nThat formula applies to monoatomic gasses in a sealed vessel, not a terrarium with holes in it exposed to ambient air at normal atmospheric pressure.  \nThe cooler air surrounding the perlite has the molecules closer together, thus at slightly higher pressure. The warmer air above has the molecules farther apart, thus lower pressure. Remember, a terrarium with holes all over it is not a sealed vessel where a rise in temperature causes a corresponding rise in pressure.  \nYou are correct that humid air is lighter(less dense) which is also a contributing factor in it rising to the relatively drier air above. A balloon rises because the hot air within is _less dense_ than the cooler air around it. It's not due to the effects of gravity on the air itself. An airplane wing produces lift by creating a lower pressure area above the wing and a higher pressure area below the wing. The carburetor on an old car works the same way, creating a lower pressure zone within the venturi, which draws fuel from the bowl through the jets and into the intake manifold.
