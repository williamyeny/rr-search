{"key":"embedding-10639558","value":{"id":10639558,"content":"Not necessarily. When they ran 1000 CFM through it, the developed static pressure was .9\", but at a lesser flow there will be less static pressure, thus it should work. The 250 linear feet per minute output they tested it with would blow a bic lighter flame out. You only want to bend the flame over 45 to 90 degrees.  \nI think you're not understanding the relationship between static pressure, resistance, and flow. There's some good reading on HVAC sites that might help you out. Basically, static pressure is what's developed behind the filter by the pressure created by the blower. For a given blower, less resistance in the filter means less static pressure and more flow. For a given resistance, more flow means you naturally develop more static pressure.   \nImagine blowing through a straw using your mouth. If you blew real easy, there would be almost no (static) pressure against the inside of your cheeks, but also not much flow. If you blew harder, there would be more flow, but also more pressure against the inside of your cheeks(static pressure) The straw diameter would determine _resistance_, and the air coming out the straw would be the cfm(flow), and how hard you exhaled would create the static pressure.
