using bulk techniques, but that's not the point.<br />To the original poster, you should get 1/2 pint wide mouth jars.&nbsp; Pint jars are too tall, and the substrate tends to pack down, making full colonization very slow.&nbsp; In addition, they don't generally fruit as well as 1/2 pint cakes, so you have slow colonization and then after a long wait, less product.&nbsp; You're far better off with twice as many 1/2 pint cakes.<br />RR","title":"Re: Using 1 pint jars instead of 1/2 pint jars for PF tek
