Theoretically this means that as they grow mushrooms just put on water weight and and stretch themselves out as opposed to developing more of the active compound..</blockquote><br />This is incorrect.&nbsp; They're continuing to divide cells, while also engorging with water.<br />Smaller mushrooms are more potent by weight than they'd be if you allowed them to go full size.&nbsp; I like to pick large pins just before the cap starts opening.&nbsp; This also gets them before they become gut-wrenching nasty to choke down. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\"
