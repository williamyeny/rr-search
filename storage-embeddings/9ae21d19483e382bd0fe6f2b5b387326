My rope lights have LEDs every .8 inches.&nbsp; I believe the ones linked to above have LEDs every 2 inches, so they won't put out as much energy per foot. They're all still in the boxes waiting to be installed at the proper time, but my early tests last spring showed LED to be about the same performance as a similar fluorescent.&nbsp; I'll get pictures up in a week or two along with some light meter readings when I get them installed.&nbsp; It's almost that stage in construction.<br />Bright light is always better than dim light, especially if you're going to be moving from cubes to more difficult species later.&nbsp; Mushrooms derive energy from the light, contrary to lots of incorrect opinion around here to the contrary.&nbsp; Mushrooms grown in a normal day/night routine of bright high frequency light will be heavier, denser, and have larger caps than mushrooms grown in dim light.&nbsp; Go for the brightest light that doesn't overheat your grow area.<br />Aside from the low power draw per lumen, the LED lights I purchased are waterproof and can be direct sprayed with high pressure hoses.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge, mine will be the first commercial mushroom farm to run on LED lights exclusively.<br />RR","title":"Re: LED rope lights vs fluorescent
