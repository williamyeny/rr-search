{"key":"embedding-10361108","value":{"id":10361108,"content":"> Quote:  \n> **Mycomechania said:**  \n> OK Zneocide, let me drop my life and placate every single concern and test on this site everyone can imagine. I'll just go out, start another 1 month project, spend a bunch more money, and make sure I post every single little frickin thing and continually try to suck all your balls... \n  \nThe above is only one quote out of several that say you need to chill the fuck out.   \nYou're free to disagree with me. No law or rule says you have to agree with everything/anything I say here. You made a blanket statement above about substrate affecting potency that you couldn't back up, and my own experiments showed the claim to be incorrect. Furthermore the idea of quinoa or amaranth increasing potency is based their tryptophan content, an assertion that has never been proved, yet has been disproved many times. You're parroting subjective posts that others have tried to duplicate and were unable to. I've ran tests on fruits from identical isolated strains grown on a plethora of substrates, using a GC, and found nothing but normal potency variations. In fact, some of the fruits grown on grains(actually seeds) you're ranting about being so great for potency tested at a lower potency, but within the range of variation that's common, thus I'd never say that quinoa or millet _lowers_ potency, but in none of my controlled tests did it ever raise it.  \nIf you had been ranting at anyone else but me in this manner, I'd have given you a few days off already. The fact that I haven't shows I'm willing to bend over backwards to allow dissenting opinion. However, any more flaming of anyone in this thread and you'll be history. You started this thread to spam and got nuked by another mod. You've also broken the rules and had moderator action in another forum, so don't push your luck. Take a chill pill, do some grows, document your findings, and post them. You had somebody disagree with you and then you went apeshit. ![:hissyfit:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/hissyfit.gif \":hissyfit:\")  \nSuch will not be tolerated, so consider yourself warned.  \nIn the meantime, take a look in advanced mycology. There's ten years worth of threads on 'increasing potency' by this or that substrate or additive. I believe it's simply genetic variation, since invariably they were all using multispore inoculation. Others disagree.
