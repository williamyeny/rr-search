above is only one quote out of several that say you need to chill the fuck out.&nbsp; <br />You're free to disagree with me.&nbsp; No law or rule says you have to agree with everything/anything I say here.&nbsp; You made a blanket statement above about substrate affecting potency that you couldn't back up, and my own experiments showed the claim to be incorrect.&nbsp; Furthermore the idea of quinoa or amaranth increasing potency is based their tryptophan content, an assertion that has never been proved, yet has been disproved many times.&nbsp; You're parroting subjective posts that others have tried to duplicate and were unable to.&nbsp; I've ran tests on fruits from identical isolated strains grown on a plethora of substrates, using a GC, and found nothing but normal potency variations.&nbsp; In fact, some of the fruits grown on grains(actually seeds) you're ranting about being so great for potency tested at a lower potency, but within the range of variation that's common, thus I'd never say that quinoa or millet <i>lowers</i> potency, but in none of my controlled tests did it ever raise it.<br />If you had been ranting at anyone else but me in this manner, I'd have given you a few days off already.&nbsp; The fact that I haven't shows I'm willing to bend over backwards to allow dissenting opinion.&nbsp; However, any more flaming of anyone in this thread and you'll be history.&nbsp; You started this thread to spam and got nuked by another mod.&nbsp; You've also broken the rules and had moderator action in another forum, so don't push your luck.&nbsp; Take a chill pill, do some grows, document your findings, and post them.&nbsp; You had somebody disagree with you and then you went apeshit.&nbsp; <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/hissyfit.gif\" alt=\":hissyfit:\" title=\":hissyfit:\"/><br />Such will not be tolerated, so consider yourself warned.<br />In the meantime, take a look in advanced mycology.&nbsp; There's ten years worth of threads on 'increasing potency' by this or that substrate or additive.&nbsp; I believe it's simply genetic variation, since invariably they were all using multispore inoculation.&nbsp; Others disagree.<br />RR","title":"Re: New Substrate
