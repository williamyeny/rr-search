/>Blargh, so much mis-information.</blockquote><br />No, not misinformation.&nbsp; Fact.&nbsp; <br />Spores stored on glass or foil last longer in general than spores stored on paper.&nbsp; However, I'd have to say I'm pretty experienced at taking sporeprints, and none of mine from 2003-2004 original PE-6 and Redboy experiments will germinate after dozens of tries.&nbsp; Occasionally, we get an old print to germinate, but as I said earlier, it's the exception rather than the rule.<br />Here's the pressure chamber I built during the Redboy experiments to help hydrate old spores.&nbsp; Glass jars are not designed to hold pressure, so I was afraid to ever go over 5 to 7 psi with it.<br />RR<br /><a href=\"https://files.shroomery.org/files/05-21/723507033-pressure_chamber1.jpg\"
