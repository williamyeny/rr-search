And he is not grinding it anymore, just buying powdered commercial agar agar.\n  \nActually, no.  \nIf you watch the full tek on DVD rather than just the sample clips, you'll see I was demonstrating with Stamets' pre-mixed agar from fungi.com and the recipe calls for 49 grams(7 tablespoons) per liter of water. That pre-mixed agar already contains the agar-agar plus the malt, dextrose, etc., ground to a fine powder, and all you do is add water. I was trying to make the video as easy for new growers to follow as possible, without going into the detailed procedures to make your own.  \nIf you buy agar-agar from an oriental food store, you need to grind it to a powder, and then boil it first before adding the nutrients, and then sterilize it all together. To this day, I have more pressing matters to spend my time on, so it's advantageous to use the pre-mixed stuff rather than going to that time and effort to make my own.  \nYou can also get pre-mixed agar from shroomery sponsors such as [Sporeworks](http://everythingmushrooms.com/search.php?search%5Fquery=agar&x=0&y=0), and possibly others.
