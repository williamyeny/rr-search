{"key":"embedding-6901508","value":{"id":6901508,"first":6900872,"last":6902921,"when":1178900807,"utime":"05/11/07 07:26 PM","content":"You're welcome.  81F is perhaps the fastest ambient temperature for mushroom mycelium, since the mycelial growth falls off rapidly at 83F and above, and not the 86F figure quoted in Stamet's TMC.  I think one of the biggest problems with incubators is stale air.  We put holes in our jars for gas exchange, but that does no good if the jars are in the bottom of a sealed up tub because it soon saturates with stale air and CO2.<br />However, for many years I have let jars colonize on an open shelf at 'normal' room temperature and they do much better with a far less incidence of contamination, especially bacteria contamination.  In the winter when ambient temperatures fall below 75F in my room, I simply run a space heater to keep the temperatures in that area.  Those with central AC systems, can simply block off part of the register in the grow room to keep the temperatures in the 75F to 80F range.<br />I haven't noticed any benefit or drawback to fruiting at the same temperature as colonization.  In fact, during the summer months my fruiting chambers are always warmer than the open shelf the jars colonize on due to the heating effects of the lights.  With the right maintenance and fruiting strategy, pinsets are just as prolific as they are in the winter when the temperature profiles are reversed.<br />I'm glad to see this finally catching on.  Since most of the teks call for incubators, and I am loathe to write teks and name them after myself, people keep reading the FAQ and building incubators.  If your house is really cold, you can benefit from a properly built incubator, but as long as you have an area that is 75F or so, it is unnecessary and counterproductive.  Molds and thermophilic bacteria like incubators more than mushroom mycelium does, that's for sure.<br />RR","title":"Re: THANK YOU
