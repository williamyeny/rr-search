This ensures the urea and the especially toxic byproduct after bacteria get to it; ammonia, is evaporated off. Your entire concept is based on a false premise.\n> \n>  \n> But we're not talking about direct exposure of mycelia to \"Urea\" or \"Ammonia\" now are we? So your refutation is based on an inapplicable premise.\n  \n![:lol:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/lol.gif \":lol:\") I'm not making that argument: You did.   \nYou said it's urea which gives manure it's nitrogen goodness and that's what chemical ferts are based on. That is incorrect on both counts. Now you are arguing that it's incorrect. You're arguing against your own earlier point which I was refuting.  \nYou haven't proposed a theory for how bacteria consume a salt and make it available to fungi. Why don't you think fungi can absorb it on its own? Fungi can digest solid rock. If it couldn't, we wouldn't see a benefit from gypsum.
