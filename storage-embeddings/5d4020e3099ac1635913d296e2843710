said:</strong><br />Any \"new\" teks you can recommend that gives a definite amount to use?</blockquote><br />There are no reputable 'teks' that give exact amounts of anything.<br />Manure is fungi food, vermiculite is fungi food, compost is fungi food, spent coffee grinds are fungi food, coir is fungi food, etc., etc.&nbsp;  <br />Gypsum is a supplement.<br />You really don't need gypsum at more than 5% to 10% by volume, which is about 3% to 5% by weight.&nbsp; Adding too much isn't going to hurt anything, but isn't going to help either.&nbsp; It would be like you taking too much of a calcium supplement.&nbsp; Your body will use what it needs and excrete the excess.&nbsp; The reason the early 'teks' don't mention gypsum is because it wasn't known at that time how valuable it is.&nbsp; In addition, many people in the online world don't follow the advances in commercial mushroom farming.&nbsp; When you have to sell your product for $3/pound, you have to get the most edge you can or go broke.&nbsp; The lessons and research conducted by the mushroom farming industry are applicable to nearly any species of mushroom, especially edibles like <i>P cubensis</i>.<br />To anyone who wants a 'recipe tek', simply make up your own and it's as valid as what I or anyone else will make.&nbsp; Use coir, manure, verm, compost, etc., in any ratio you want or have available.&nbsp; They're all good by themselves, but mixed together are even better.&nbsp; When you're done, toss in a bit of granulated gypsum, bring it all to field capacity and pasteurize at 140F for an hour to 90 minutes.<br />If it would help to see a simple bulk substrate being put together, check out the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Horse-Manure-Substrate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">manure substrate video</a> clip on my website.&nbsp; It shows only horse manure and gypsum to keep it simple, but adding any other bulk substrate material to the mix makes it even better.&nbsp; There's a good demonstration of getting 'field capacity' moisture content in the <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Casing-Layer-Preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">casing layer video clip</a>.&nbsp; These are just sample clips cut from the full release on DVD, but they show enough to get the point.<br />RR","title":"Re:
