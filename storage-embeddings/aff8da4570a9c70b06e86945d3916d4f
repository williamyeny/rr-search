If they were compatible they would have formed dikaryotic hyphae. But it is really hard to see in that shot. Is there a clear line without Myc where they come together?&nbsp; In other words are they repelling each other?&nbsp; If so they are incompatible strains. You can always just put a small wedge from say five different plates in each jar to increase likelihood of compatibility</blockquote><br />Just to clarify something, strains <i>already are</i> dikaryotic.&nbsp; Hyphae are monokaryotic.&nbsp; If compatible mononucleate hyphae(monokaryotic mycelium) meet, they exchange DNA and become polynucleate (dikaryotic).&nbsp; You can't have dikaryotic hyphae as that would be like a two wheeled monocycle.<br />RR","title":"Re: Agar
