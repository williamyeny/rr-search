{"key":"embedding-10007786","value":{"id":10007786,"content":"> Quote:  \n> Also, I JUST quoted RR saying that you DON'T want rH over \\~85% when fruiting. \n  \nAs time has passed, some of my advice and practices have changed with increased knowledge and experience. I no longer try for 85% humidity in my grow rooms. I prefer 90% to 99% because I've found that the 4 to 5 air exchanges per hour that are recommended by stamets to be the bare minimum, and performance is increased by providing much more FAE than that.  \nThe 'old' conventional wisdom was to keep cased substrates at 85% humidity and carefully calibrate air exchanges to four per hour. However, a few more years of experimentation revealed that if you really go for the gusto and provide more air exchange, your substrates dry out too much if you keep the air at 85%.  \nThat figure in stamets' books is probably intended for commercial grow rooms where they're running a lot of heat or AC to maintain temps, and he was giving the minimum figures for FAE to get acceptable performance without dumping all your warm or cool air outside, thus having to heat massive amounts of fresh air. For our small operations, this extra cost of increased fresh air isn't a concern, thus we go for more air exchange, and likewise a higher humidity. I hope that makes sense.
