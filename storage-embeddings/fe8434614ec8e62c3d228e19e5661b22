The pot of water in the oven will 'steam' off(the word is evaporate) from the top until it's dry. Only after it's dry can the container it's in actually reach 100C.\n> \n>  \n> No I didn't. So how is that different from the cake your boiling? You still haven't clarified that point. \n  \nThe cake in a jar is suspended above a pot of boiling water with a lid on it. This creates 100% humidity in the pot above the water and below the lid. This is what allows the substrate in the jar to reach 100C without evaporating all the moisture away. This is why we sometimes have to add water to the boiling pot during the cycle, but not to the jars, since they don't dry out.  \nIn your tray in the oven, you have no pot of water surrounding the substrate. The moisture in the tray is all you have, thus by definition when it reaches 210F/100C, all the moisture will be gone due to evaporation.  \nI really can't explain it any clearer. I wish you the best of luck.
