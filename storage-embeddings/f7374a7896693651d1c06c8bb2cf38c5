I know everyone says dont use a digital one but I bought one from walmart for about 6 bucks and it reads RH and Temp in either celsius or farenheit. So far it has worked fine for me but I have yet to use it in a FC.</blockquote><br />How do you know it works fine?<br />I have a $250 digital hygrometer and it's as crappy as the cheap ones.&nbsp; On a rain soaked foggy day, or when wrapped in a damp towel, it only reads 85% instead of 100%.&nbsp; Digital hygrometers are shit, plain and simple, regardless of cost.<br />To the original poster, experience has taught us to use a properly calibrated analog hair hygrometer, and then use it to adjust a cycle timer to control your humidifier if you're running a mini-greenhouse.&nbsp; If you're building a terrarium, just make a <a href=\"http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">shotgun terrarium</a> and you don't need a hygrometer.&nbsp; If you build it per the tek, it WILL be at the right humidity level.<br />RR","title":"Re: Finding the perfect Temperature and Relative Humidity
