Anyone who doesn't understand how moist air holds heat better than dry air needs to go outside on a clear, dry night. The temperature will drop like a rock. Go outside on a foggy or cloudy night, and the temperature remains stable. Indoors, a normal room humidity of 25% to 35% during winter will save energy over the 5% or less we see in cold climates. One should also keep a window cracked open for fresh air unless you like breathing stale air, even if leaving a window open loses some of your heat or AC.  \nAnonjon, I've had enough of your stirring up shit around here. You're a fucking drama queen and I'm sick to tears of it. It seems that every day you have PMs in my box, snitching on what others are doing, while you're flaming and posting stupid shit like the above  \nFor anyone else who is genuinely interested in how moist air holds heat better even though it's less dense, here's the exact question getting answered by scientists at the [Argonne National Laboratory.](http://anonym.to/?http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/wea00/wea00330.htm)
