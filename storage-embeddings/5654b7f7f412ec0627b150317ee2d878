I've been saying it for years, Paul Stamets has been saying it for years, and you can google gypsum & mushroom farms, and see the results for yourself.  Mushrooms are one of the best sources for humans to get calcium.  The calcium in mushrooms is much easier to absorb into your system than calcium from dairy products.  Doesn't it make sense to make sure your substrate has plenty?<br />A few years ago, they said I was nuts when I reported that coir is a useful substrate material. Everyone said \"coir has no nutes\", as if mushrooms somehow need NPK. Search 'coir' and my username here and in advanced from 2003-2004 and you'll see what I mean. Then they said mushrooms would never grow on coffee-it's too acidic.  Now they say gypsum provides little benefit, despite evidence to the contrary.<br />You can grow cubes without using gypsum, as we well know.  However, you'll get more bang for the buck when using it.  In addition, it keeps the substrate nice and loose for the mycelium to easily colonize, and it resists pH swings as the mushroom metabolites try to swing the pH lower.<br />RR","title":"Re:
