/>1/4 bit<br />Wtf!&nbsp; <br />There should be a sticky for noobs that states in 25 size font that<br />IF YOU ARE GROWING IN WINTER OR/AND CANT SUSTAIN RELATIVE HUMIDITY IN YOUR HOUSE/GROWING AREA ABOVE 50% , YOU <u>WILL</u> NEED A HUMIDIFIER <br />A lot of people would look to different FC and save a lot of money<br />knowing no matter what they do they will still need a humidifier , I just spent $120 on a all the crap for a Shotgun setup just to find out that I need a $30&nbsp;  humidifier that I dot even want for a stupid shotty setup. fucken great</blockquote><br />Calm down and pay attention.<br />I run several shotgun terrariums in my house all winter, where it averages -20F to -40F at night, and up to about 0F for the high temp.&nbsp; It's still -5F outside right now in the middle of March, due to my location at high elevation in the mountains right on the Canadian border.&nbsp; I run a wood stove for heat, which seriously dries out the air.&nbsp; I run a cool mist humidifier in the room with the woodstove and my terrariums all maintain 95+ percent humidity.<br />If your ambient humidity is below 30%, then you're spending up to double the cost to heat your damn house.&nbsp; Moist air holds heat FAR better than dry air, thus if your house is dry, you're paying to heat the whole neighborhood.<br />You don't need 50% ambient humidity for a shotgun to work, as I previously thought.&nbsp; 30% is more than enough.<br />Don't tape the holes.&nbsp; If you built it by the tek, it will work.&nbsp; However, if you only used two to three inches of perlite, and only drilled holes on five sides, and spent $120 to build a $10 terrarium, you didn't build it by the tek.&nbsp; Fresh air exchange is the NUMBER ONE pinning trigger.&nbsp; You can always mist to make up for lost moisture, which you should be doing anyway.&nbsp; Covering holes to get humidity at the expense of fresh air is the OPPOSITE of what you should do.&nbsp; Fresh air stimulates pins and suppresses molds.&nbsp; In addition, there's no way in hell your terrarium dropped to 40%.&nbsp; Calibrate your hygrometer.<br />RR","title":"Re: Shotgun FAE holes and
