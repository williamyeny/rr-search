/>i look at it like this the speed control regulates the amount of energy the fan will receve and make it faster or slower. like a dimmer switch the dimmer the light gets the less amount of voltage the bulb is getting.<br />or like useing a 220 on a 110 ciurcut. the internal conponets are meant to run on a diffrent voltage. and when the voltage gets messed with thats what will make things deteriorate. happens more when you over charge the system. but you should be fine.<br />2' by4' nice i found a guy dropping them for 475 one day ill be rich</blockquote><br />Motor speed controllers don't work that way.&nbsp; They chop off part of the wave, rather than reduce the voltage.&nbsp; They're not rheostats.<br />To Frizzle, that should work, but putting two motors in series is going to have unpredictable results.&nbsp; The first motor would be sort of a charging motor for the second one, but usually the smaller motor is used to charge the larger one.&nbsp; About all I can say is try it and see what happens with your airflow.&nbsp; You could probably get rid of the 4\" motor and let the 10\" do all the work.&nbsp; Reducing from 10\" to 4\" isn't going to hurt your motor.&nbsp; It will actually reduce the load on it.<br />RR","title":"Re: question about inline
