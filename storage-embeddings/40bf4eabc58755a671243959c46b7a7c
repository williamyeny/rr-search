They chop off part of the wave, rather than reduce the voltage. They're not rheostats.  \nTo Frizzle, that should work, but putting two motors in series is going to have unpredictable results. The first motor would be sort of a charging motor for the second one, but usually the smaller motor is used to charge the larger one. About all I can say is try it and see what happens with your airflow. You could probably get rid of the 4\" motor and let the 10\" do all the work. Reducing from 10\" to 4\" isn't going to hurt your motor. It will actually reduce the load on it.
