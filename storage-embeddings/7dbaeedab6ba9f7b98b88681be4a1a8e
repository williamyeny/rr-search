If the former, that would seem to suggest that the ideal concentration of CO2 is somewhat higher than the ambient ~380 ppm.</blockquote><br />The mechanism fungi use to convert light to biomass remains for future researchers to find out.&nbsp; I do know, as does just about everyone here who has switched to proper lighting, that mushrooms grown with the proper lighting will be double or more in size.<br />In addition, with many species, growth in the mycelium expansion stage is also faster when exposed to ambient light.&nbsp; For example, with my shiitake, I can see almost double the rate of growth on the top petri dish in a stack.&nbsp; Temperature is the same for all, but the dish on top which gets more light will always be ahead of those below it.&nbsp; Somebody should try this with cubes.&nbsp; These dishes get low ambient light, nothing direct.<br />RR","title":"Re:
