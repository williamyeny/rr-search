This is what I'm talking about when I say I don't get why this idea is so controversial. Even a success story is barred from discussing it's ideas with the community. What's everyone afraid of?\n  \nI'll tell you exactly what we're afraid of. These threads get indexed daily by the search engines, both internal on this site, and external, such as yahoo, msn and google.  \nSince we have people here who don't understand the difference between the physical state of water at 211F and 213F(99.5C and 100.5C), these threads sometimes turn nasty when someone doesn't know when enough is enough.  \nAs has already been pointed out, mason jars don't hold pressure. If they did, they could explode whenever someone misused a steamer, boiling pot, or pressure cooker, exposing the jar manufacturer to liability. Mason jars will vent pressure by leakage under the seal, thus when liquid water turns to a gaseous state at 212F/100C, it will attempt to pressurize, but will instead leak out under the lid and escape, leaving your substrate bone dry by the time 212F/100C is reached throughout the jar. That's not opinion, it's scientific fact.  \nI've prepared pf jars with _zero sterilization_ and achieved a 50% to 70% success rate. I'm sure those who don't understand that if their jars have moisture in them after 'oven sterilization', it means that 212F/100C hasn't been reached, thus any bacteria in the jars will still be there. However, since molds are killed off at 140F/60C, the jars got hot enough to prevent green molds, and as long as bacteria was not present, they're fine. However, they're growing on non-sterilized substrate. Will it fail every time? No. However, a 30% to 50% failure rate on a procedure is enough for us to point out its invalidity, no matter how stubbornly those who have 'invented' the method for the thousandth time insist on promoting it.
