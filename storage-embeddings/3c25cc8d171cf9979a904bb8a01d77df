Instead of saying \"go read more, you're not worthy of my answer\" you could just say \"well it varies by your tek and materials.  what's your setup and we can help further?\"  or just don't say anything at all.<br />God damn, I understand the need for forum etiquette but there's no need for 'veterans' being assholes.  It goes completely against the things mushrooms try to teach people. </blockquote><br />Perhaps you can be kind enough to allow the staff here to do our own moderating chores?  It's awfully hard to defend when someone asks how much a glass jar will yield, without even a hint at what's INSIDE the jar, or \"I no 1/8 is like 3.5 grams so what would 1/8 be dry?\" as if 3.5 grams of feathers somehow weighs more than 3.5 grams of lead.<br />Somebody seriously needs to study up, and at least do a bit of proof-reading prior to entering a post.  Reading and searching for knowledge is how one learns.  Nobody learns by turning off their brains and expecting to have information poured into their head by others, the way we pour water from a pitcher.<br />RR","title":"Re: How many
