in fastest growth, but he got that info from someone else.&nbsp; My own tests on petri dishes at controlled temperature showed growth was completely flat between 75F and 81F and then began to fall rapidly at 83F and above.<br />This is why we recommend room temperature colonization.&nbsp; Since the procedures we use for sterilization in jars don't completely sterilize the grains, a lower temperature gives less chance of bacteria bloom in the two to three weeks it takes for the mycelium to get a full grip on the substrate.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>fastfred said:</strong><br

that's a fact.</blockquote><br />2 hours?&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Quart jars sterilize just fine in under an hour.</blockquote><br />Nonsense.&nbsp; An empty quart jar&nbsp; may sterilize great in under an hour, but that same jar full of grains after an hour at 15psi will not have reached 250F in the center of the substrate.&nbsp; I've tested this with strips. 90 minutes is required, and even then you need to get the grains colonized as quickly as possible.<br />People seriously need to disregard what their biology teacher says about autoclave sterilization of scalpels, forceps, etc., when working with grains and listen to those of us who have been <i>sterilizing grains</i> for mushroom growing for many years.&nbsp; We've already suffered the failures and developed the techniques we share with others for one reason: Because they work.<br />RR","title":"Re: True Incubation Temps
