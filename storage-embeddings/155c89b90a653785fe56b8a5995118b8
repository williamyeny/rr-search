Yes, there needs to be an enormous reclaimation effort to get the majority of the oil, but there is no technology available that will get it all. Oyster logs would be ideal as a post-cleanup polishing treatment of residue affected areas, but as a primary cleanup measure it would be a failure of the proportions of the whole string of accidents from the incident.\n  \nI think you're failing to consider the extreme heat on the gulf coast. As a mycologist, I'd be all over this IF it would work. What worked on a few dozen gallons near the cool PNW coast in a 55F rain-soaked climate is not going to work under a blazing sun in 100F heat. _P ostreatus_ is the best known species suited to metabolize oil, but it's a cool weather species. It would fry in the MS delta.  \nFurthermore, this oil occupies as much area as MS, LA, and AR put together. That would be one hell of a substrate, and there simply isn't enough land to pull it off, assuming the climate _was_ suitable. In addition, it would take the entire crop of straw produced in the US for a year, even IF it would work. It's a cute idea, but when thought out to conclusion, it's outside the scope of myco-recovery. Dreams are great and how invention is born, but this dream is akin to flying one of the paper airplanes we all made as kids to the moon.
