{"key":"embedding-14960167","value":{"id":14960167,"content":"**Welcome to Mushroom Cultivation!**  \nThis forum is dedicated to all aspects of cultivating **psychoactive mushrooms**\n  \nIf you're not growing Psychoactive Mushrooms but would like to learn about growing mushrooms.  \n[Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms](/forums/postlist.php/Board/13)  \nThis forum is dedicated to the cultivation of gourmet and medicinal mushrooms. It is not a drug related forum.  \n**All sitewide rules apply.**  \n[Administrative Rules & Guidelines](/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/1465662)  \n[Legal Disclaimer](/8415/Legal-Disclaimer)  \n[Privacy Statement ](/forums/viewprivacy.php)  \nPlease post all identification request questions in the [Mushroom Hunting](/forums/postlist.php/Board/Forum3) forum.  \nIf you are just getting started or just visiting this forum [please visit the getting started forum](/forums/postlist.php/Board/83)  \nand have a look through these helpful threads [Here](/forums/showflat.php/Number/24420178) [Here](/forums/showflat.php/Number/23745550) [Here](/forums/showflat.php/Number/24144021)  \nNo flaming will be tolerated in this forum. I consider name calling a flame and will take appropriate action to resolve any users who practice flaming. The reason we will not tolerate flaming is that there is no need for it and it is destructive to learning. Please post with respect.  \n**Also, No trolling, illegal activity, spamming, solicitation, gore/shock pics, off topic replies, etc.** \n**DO NOT TRY TO BUY OR SELL DRUGS HERE**  \nThis forum has a zero tolerance policy on the above. You won't receive a warning, this _is_ the warning. Bans won't be limited to this forum, they will be sitewide. This forum exists for people to learn and be welcomed, not to be ridiculed or trolled.  \nusers in this forum should know how to [post a picture](/forums/showflat.php/Number/13674858) and how to [resize a picture](/5288/How-do-I-resize-a-picture) .  \n\n**Common courtesy**\n  \nIf you see someone violating a rule outlined in the thread, click the Notify Moderator button or refer them to this FAQ and **do NOT** flame them or even argue. It is the job of the moderators and administrators to contend with anyone who is not following the rules.\n  \nRules\n  \n**0.**  \nTalking in the third person is moronic. Don't use SWIM, my dog, my friend, etc...   \n**1.** **Please use the [search posts](/forums/search.php) function before asking a question.** Your question has already been asked and answered hundreds of times, so don't think you're going to get a better answer by asking it again. In the 'search posts' link at the top of the page, you can select an individual user or the trusted cultivator group as a whole to filter results to come only from them. [more on how to use the search engine effectively](/forums/showflat.php/Number/24270830#24270830)  \n**2.** **Do not ask a question, and then when you get your answer, delete your original post** as if we're your personal unpaid research assistants. For every poster, there's 1000 lurkers who use the search engine to find their answers and never post. Don't screw them by deleting your question, thus making the search engine return crap. Users who violate this rule will be officially warned, and repeat offenders will be banned.  \n**3.** **Spores of active species are sold for microscopy use only so mycologists can ID mushrooms.** Cultivation supplies are for legitimate legal growing. If you're going to misuse them to grow a controlled substance, keep it to yourself. Any post which mentions 'such and such' vendor, will be deleted and you'll receive an official warning. No one needs to know where you got your spores, kit, or other supplies.   \nAlso, Do not plug non sponsors.  \nSponsor feedback goes in the sponsor forum.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **Ythan said:**  \n> Hello! We don't allow new members to post immediately in our Sponsors forum for two reasons:  \n> First, new members can be a bit impatient and tend to shoot first and ask questions later. For example, if they do not receive their order within a week, or a handful of days go by without communication from the vendor, we have seen complaints and cries of being \"ripped off\" posted, only to see that their order was ultimately fulfilled and the vendor did come through.   \n> Also, some sponsors have been known to provide incentives to customers who will sign up to post positive reviews. By implementing post restrictions in the Sponsors forum, we help mitigate this manipulation by ensuring that those who post in the forum are foremost community members, and not just someone stopping by to \"hit and run\" for a freebie in exchange for their positive review.  \n> If you stick around for a while and participate in some of our other forums, your ability to post in the Sponsor's forum will automatically unlock after 30 days and 25 posts. ![:cheers:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/cheers.gif \":cheers:\") \n  \n**4.** **Do not bump your own thread for at least 24 hours.** It's not fair to the other posters to have your thread constantly bumped to the top. Violators will have their thread deleted. Every post you make has an available edit button so you can avoid double posting.  \n**5.** **No flaming in mushroom cultivation**. If you're unable to post without showing respect to others, take it elsewhere.  \n**6.** **Do NOT ask strain questions in cultivation.** Ask those silly q's [here](/forums/postlist.php/Board/286), 'Strain' in mushrooms is not the same as strain in pot growing, thus we keep 'strain talk' sequestered in it's own dungeon so people won't think it actually matters.  \n**7.** Be smart and don't incriminate yourself. Any mention of selling or profiting off of drugs, outright or between the lines, will be deleted and a warning issued. The next offense will result in a ban.  \n**8.** **Don't drag posts off topic with non-sense**. Plenty of other forums to post in so no need for vulgar, nonsense, or off topic posting in cultivation... this will result in a ban.  \n**9.** **No asking for in person meetings, partners, hookups, etc...**  \nIf you would like to request a real life buddy, send make a topic about it in the Gathering Forum. You will gain access to the [Gathering Forum](/forums/postlist.php/Board/16) after being a member for more than 60 days and when you have reached more than 100 posts. Posts announcing mushroom events and official group forays are permitted; please don't take groups of people picking psilocybin mushrooms.  \n**10.** **Never give an identification if you are not sure, and never suggest that anyone eat an unidentified mushroom.**  \nMushroom Hunting can be a dangerous hobby if you are not informed. If you suspect that what you're about to say could turn out to be wrong, very clearly disclaim it so people know you are just guessing. Never guess that it is an active species unless you are very sure. Incorrect ID's can have negative consequences. Leave all identifications for the identification forum. Familiarize yourself with our system of trusted identifiers.  \n**11.** **Do not ask what mushrooms can be found growing in your state or immediate area.** That information can be found here: [http://www.shroomery.org/8461/Which-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area](/8461/Which-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area) See also [An overview on how to find Psilocybin Mushrooms.](/forums/showflat.php/Number/12412007)  \n**12.** **Do not ask about current finds in your area.**  \nThese posts have been flooding the forum for years. If you're curious about if mushrooms are growing in your area, get out there and look! Mushrooms don't read the books. Sometimes they fruit outside of season. There is no set date for any season, only vast generalizations. Your best bet is that if it's close to the season for the mushroom you are looking for and its been raining, you just might find some.  \n**13.** **Do not make threads or posts discussing or reporting the weather.**  \nThis includes complaining about the weather, asking if the current weather is \"good for shrooms\", or how long to wait after rain fall to go hunting. If it has rained within the last 1-10 days, and the temperatures are correct for the type of mushroom you're looking for, and the time of year is correct then it is certain that that the mushroom you are looking for is growing.  \n**14.** **No asking when or where mushrooms, or a specific mushroom species will grow.**  \nThis includes, asking what habitat a mushroom\\[s\\] can be found- or their preferred fruiting conditions. This can be very simply answered by using the \"search posts\" feature: [http://www.shroomery.org/forums/search.php](/forums/search.php)  \n**15.** **No requesting or revealing specific locations.**  \nUse common sense about what might be considered a specific location. Anything that could lead someone right to the spot is not allowed - It is perfectly fine to mention places that are more than a couple square kilometers. When in doubt, do the moderators a favor and just don't say it.  \n\n_Harassment of other members will not be tolerated at the Shroomery, and may result in an immediate ban depending on severity. If you have a problem with another member, please make your peace with them. If you cannot behave in a respectful manner, keep your words to yourself. Failure to comply will result in administrative action at the sole discretion of the staff. All members are encouraged to PM a moderator or administrator with relevant information if they cannot resolve their conflict privately._ \n  \nCONTESTS, GIVE AWAYS, TRADES, ECT...\n  \nMust go in the marketplace forum, not here. If you want to give away prints, great. Just do it in the marketplace please. If you don't have access yet, wait until you do.  \nThe marketplace access rules regarding time since registering were put in place for a reason, not the least of which is to discourage our members from giving their names and addresses to people who just recently joined and/or are not known. We don't allow new members to make posts seeking trades, as a means of protecting our established members, for obvious reasons. You can't make a trade without giving your address, and receiving the address of someone else. That's why we require 90 days since registration before having access to the marketplace forum. 90 days is no guarantee of course, but it's long enough for most of the jerkoffs to become known and avoided.  \nThere are trade ratings in addition to general ratings. These can be an indicator of who would be someone you have a safe bet trading with. That's not to say 50 positive trade ratings is a guarantee of anything. There have been cases of members with >50 +5 trade ratings later posting google image pictures of people's residences. As well as sending things months later which is evidence that people don't always destroy your address after sending. Play it safe and keep yourself safe when in doubt it's not worth saving the $10-20 it may cost to obtain what you're looking for a safe way. Trading is an amazing benefit that comes with our online mushroom community. Do your part and be a responsible trader. Delete addresses from your online mailboxes and shred letters with personal information. Misuse of personal information is grounds for permanent removal.   \nPlease follow the rule, and if you see a post asking for a trade in this forum, please hit the notify moderator button, which is the train whistle icon at the bottom of every post.
