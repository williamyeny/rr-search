We don't allow new members to post immediately in our Sponsors forum for two reasons:<br />First, new members can be a bit impatient and tend to shoot first and ask questions later. For example, if they do not receive their order within a week, or a handful of days go by without communication from the vendor, we have seen complaints and cries of being \"ripped off\" posted, only to see that their order was ultimately fulfilled and the vendor did come through. <br />Also, some sponsors have been known to provide incentives to customers who will sign up to post positive reviews. By implementing post restrictions in the Sponsors forum, we help mitigate this manipulation by ensuring that those who post in the forum are foremost community members, and not just someone stopping by to \"hit and run\" for a freebie in exchange for their positive review.<br />If you stick around for a while and participate in some of our other forums, your ability to post in the Sponsor's forum will automatically unlock after 30 days and 25 posts. <img style=\"max-width:192px;height:auto;\" src=\"https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\":cheers:\"/> </blockquote><br /><span style=\"font-size:larger\"><b><span style=\"font-size:larger\">4.</span><!--/larger//--></b></span><!--/larger//-->&nbsp; <b>Do not bump your own thread for at least 24 hours.</b>&nbsp; It's not fair to the other posters to have your thread constantly bumped to the top.&nbsp; Violators will have their thread deleted.

If you want to give away prints, great.&nbsp; Just do it in the marketplace please.&nbsp; If you don't have access yet, wait until you do.<br />The marketplace access rules regarding time since registering were put in place for a reason, not the least of which is to discourage our members from giving their names and addresses to people who just recently joined and/or are not known. We don't allow new members to make posts seeking trades, as a means of protecting our established members, for obvious reasons.&nbsp; You can't make a trade without giving your address, and receiving the address of someone else.&nbsp; That's why we require 90 days since registration before having access to the marketplace forum.&nbsp; 90 days is no guarantee of course, but it's long enough for most of the jerkoffs to become known and avoided.<br />There are trade ratings in addition to general ratings. These can be an indicator of who would be someone you have a safe bet trading with. That's not to say 50 positive trade ratings is a guarantee of anything. There have been cases of members with &gt;50 +5 trade ratings later posting google image pictures of people's residences. As well as sending things months later which is evidence that people don't always destroy your address after sending. Play it safe and keep yourself safe when in doubt it's not worth saving the $10-20 it may cost to obtain what you're looking for a safe way. Trading is an amazing benefit that comes with our online mushroom community. Do your part and be a responsible trader. Delete addresses from your online mailboxes and shred letters with personal information. Misuse of personal information is grounds for permanent removal.&nbsp;  <br />Please follow the rule, and if you see a post asking for a trade in this forum, please hit the notify moderator button, which is the train whistle icon at the bottom of every post.&nbsp; Don't argue with or flame the person making the inappropriate post, but simply hit that button and let us handle it.<br />**This
