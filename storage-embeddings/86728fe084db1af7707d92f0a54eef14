Light at the higher end of the spectrum such as fluorescent is far better than light at the lower end of the spectrum.<br />There is more disinformation in this thread than you'll find at church on Sunday.&nbsp; The fluorescent lamp Appalachian Guy posted above will work great.&nbsp; 12/12 is preferred, but also as said above, timing isn't critical.&nbsp; Turn it on when you get up in the mornings, and turn it off when you get home from work and you'll be fine.&nbsp; If you have a timer, set it for 12/12 and forget it.<br />Those who are satisfied with one or two mushrooms can use incandescent, moonlight or a bic lighter.&nbsp; Those who want wall to wall flushes or cakes covered in mushrooms will do well to heed the advice of those who have tried everything already.<br />RR","title":"Re: A lighting thought...
