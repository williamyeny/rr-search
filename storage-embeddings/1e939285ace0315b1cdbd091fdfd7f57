It's used in outdoor gardens to break up tough, clay soils.  It's also used with houseplant soil to absorb the salts from chemical fertilizers. Gypsum is the component in drywall as well.  In fact, the garden gypsum I use obviously is waste product from the sheetrock plant.  It even has some of the brown and white paper mixed in.<br />Gypsum will actually lower the PH slightly due to its sulphur content.  Gypsum supplies both calcium and sulphur which mushrooms need.  The advantage to gypsum is that it tends to hold the PH steady, not allowing radical swings either direction.  <br />RR","title":"Re: Relationship between Hydrated Lime and Calcium
