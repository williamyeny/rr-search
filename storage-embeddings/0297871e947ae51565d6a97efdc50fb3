If the temperature and dewpoint are equal at the surface of the earth, fog forms.&nbsp; If the dewpoint and temperature are equal at 5000 feet elevation, clouds form at 5000 feet. <b>Moist air is lighter than dry air</b>, whether you are capable of understanding this basic concept or not.&nbsp; Your failure to understand simple physics does not render the science invalid unless you wish to make a point that adam and eve rode around on dinosaurs and praised jesus while they wrote the bible, in which case no further explanation is necessary.<br />I suggest you don't argue science with scientists.<br />Go to google.com and type, \"moist air lighter than dry air\" or something similar and look at the 500,000 or so hits you get to see where you're so off base on this.&nbsp; I've typed the detailed answer so many dozens and dozens of times that my fingers hurt, and I won't be typing it again for those too lazy to search for such simple stuff the rest of us learned as kids.<br
