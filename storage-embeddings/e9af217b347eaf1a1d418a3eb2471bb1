The reason is that food soaking in room temperature water will begin to grow bacteria in a matter of hours.  The refrigerator helps slow down the biological activity while the substrate rehydrates.  You should also rinse the cake after the dunk under running water before placing back in the fruiting chamber.<br />For cased substrates, they rehydrate much faster than cakes, so I usually leave them in the tray with the sink faucet running gently to fill up the tray and let it overlflow.  Just let the running water hydrate your trays for an hour or two, and it's plenty.  The running water will prevent bacterial buildup just like the refrigerator, as well as to help wash away contaminant spores that may have landed on the surface.  The running water doesn't seem to damage or otherwise hurt the primordia or small pins.  The next day, they'll have tripled in size.<br />RR","title":"Re: What's the deal with cold
