Performance was almost always crappy compared to fruiting them in the same orientation they colonized in. I duplicated the experiment by fruiting them right side up for first flush and upside down for second. Performance was again less than leaving them upright from colonization through final flush.  \nWhether this correlates to cubes or not I have no idea. On the left are shiitake blocks fruited the same orientation as they colonized. On the right are blocks of the same isolated strain turned upside down. Note that almost no mushrooms formed on what was the bottom of the substrate during colonization.  \nRR
