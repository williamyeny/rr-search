It's already been beat to death way too many times.  \n> Condensation is in fact an excellent indicator of humidity if you know the temperature variables or control them in some manner.  \n> Condensation happens at the \"dew point\". This is used both in science and meteorology and is the absolute gold standard in humidity measurement.  \n> \\-FF\n  \nExactly.  \nHowever, the problem isn't those with a science background trying to wing it without a hygrometer, it's the _know it all noob_ trying to say there's plenty of humidity because someone has condensation on the sides of a terrarium. However, he may still have no mushrooms because he has no air exchange, which just happens to be the number 1 pinning trigger.  \nI can put a sealed terrarium and a shotgun terrarium side by side on a table and the sealed one will have condensation, but the shotgun won't, even though it's at a higher RH than the sealed tub. The point is, to get an accurate measure of humidity, you need something besides just the condensation on the walls of the terrarium. Mushroom substrates create heat, which causes an increased temp differential, which then results in the sides of the terrarium reaching the dew point. However, this has nothing to do with whether the humidity and fresh air supply _within_ is correct for cultivation, especially in a house where the owner turns the heat down at night.  \nMost of the 'I don't have any humidity because I can't see condensation' threads are from people using a shotgun terrarium, which will NOT have condensation on the walls, even at 100% humidity.
