In a week, another one will pop up because nobody reads what has been written before.<br />\"A human is a human\" and that's a fact, meaning all require certain foods and temperature ranges to grow and be healthy, and all can cross/breed with each other.  Nobody says that means we're all clones.  Parents with ten children know that all ten kids(strains?) are totally different due to the way the genetics stacked up, but they all need the same food, shelter and care.<br />\"A cube is a cube\" and that's a fact.  They all require certain foods and temperature ranges to grow and be healthy, and all cube strains can easily cross/breed with each other. Nobody says that means they're all clones.  Any grower with ten strains will tell you they're all different due to the way the genetics stacked up with that particular crossing, but that doesn't mean they have different cultivation requirements.<br />When you see the standard \"A cube is a cube\" answer, it is in response to someone posting something such as: \"What temperature should I fruit my B+ at?\"<br />Why is this so hard to understand?<br />RR","title":"Re: We Are Going To Solve This Right
