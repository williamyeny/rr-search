wrong.&nbsp; The chinese pressure cookers come with instructions to speed cool by pouring cold water on a steaming hot pressure cooker.&nbsp; Doing so is an excellent method to test Darwin's theories with your hard-earned cash.<br />Bathtubs are the third nastiest place in any house.&nbsp; To put sterile jars in a bathtub of water to cool them is just plain #%*@%, especially when you consider you're fucking up a month-long project to save a few hours of cool time, less than one day.&nbsp; Don't do it.<br />RR","title":"Re: Can i somehow speed cool my pressure cooker and the jars in
