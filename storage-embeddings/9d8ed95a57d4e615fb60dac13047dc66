Even on an open shelf, if I get trich in one jar and don't notice it right away, the jars immediately around it often get infected a few days later. No jar filter is perfect, and if you have a massive spore release, it easily overwhelms even the best filter material. That's why I recommend colonizing out in the open.  \nIn addition, stale air in a box leads to anaerobic conditions, which promote bacteria. Furthermore, mushroom mycelium has circadian rhythms, thus having them on an open shelf exposes the mycelium to a day-night schedule of light and temperature fluctuations which helps establish the pattern for later, resulting in a better fruiting performance when the time comes.
