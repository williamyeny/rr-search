{"key":"embedding-11674242","value":{"id":11674242,"content":"**The disinformation is this thread is an embarrassment to the community.**   \nEvery single mushroom grown in the wild grows in conjunction with other molds and bacteria. That's how nature works. Do you guys think for a minute that a manure pile in a cow pasture is sterile? Have none of you ever picked oyster mushrooms on a downed log and noticed half the log is green with trichoderma? I've picked _P cyanescens_ that were fruiting less than an inch from deadly galerina mushrooms, with both mycelial colonies completely infused into the same substrate soil. Different fungi can share the same substrate without transferring some sort of imaginary toxins from one to the other.  \nIf molds are so toxic, why do they make salad dressing with penicillium, and why do organic gardeners order trichoderma cultures to put in the soil next to their potatoes, carrots and radishes? We cut mold off of cheese because it tastes like dirt, not because it's harmful. The coir we buy very often has trichoderma deliberately infused into it to make it better for plant growing. Does this mean you die if you smoke a bowl of hydro?  \nLet's try to be a bit more careful before saying such nonsense that molds on a substrate render the fruits toxic. They do not. A reference to heavy metals uptake has ZERO to do with other fungi sharing the same substrate. For someone to declare that molds on a substrate are somehow 'absorbed' into the mushrooms is ludicrous and shows a complete lack of understanding of life. If a white guys brushes up against a black guy on the bus does all the black rub off on him? Think before you post please, and if not, at least use the search engine where this topic has been covered hundreds of times before.  \nWe toss out contaminated substrates to protect our mycelium, and our growing environment, not our own health. Mold on a substrate is contrary to the sterile procedures we've developed to grow more on a small shelf in six weeks than nature can grow in a 300 acre pasture all year. That's why we use sterile procedure, and that's why we toss out contaminated cakes and other substrates, NOT to protect ourselves.
