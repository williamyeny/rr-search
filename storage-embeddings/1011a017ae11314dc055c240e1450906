Is that not specifically for when one has a setup in a clear container, in order to prevent light from hitting the sides? Im thinking yes since your addressing side pinning... As far as that I have a non transparent tub and i am not having any trouble with side pins other than what you have addressed as the microclimate between cake and side. I had not thought of that, thanks for pointing that out.&nbsp; </blockquote><br />Light hitting the sides does not cause side pinning.&nbsp; As said, it's the microclimate.&nbsp; HOWEVER, you should be using a clear tub.&nbsp; This way you have five sides admitting light rather than one side(top).&nbsp; This results in MUCH more light, which is necessary for proper pinset and flushes.<br />In addition, fresh air is the number one pinning trigger.&nbsp; You don't get fresh air through polyfill.&nbsp; Many strains are CO2 tolerant, but others are not.&nbsp; If you have a CO2 intolerant strain, you'll get piss poor results without proper fresh air supply.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br /><strong>jflow008 said:</strong><br />Is there any reason that i should not clone a larger healthy mushroom vs a medium healthy one? The only reason i can think of is that one fruit is an eighth and that would look funny if one is going to divide them. Not that my foaf plans that. I know some people think caps are more potent than stems but im pretty sure thats BS.</blockquote><br />Large fruits are less potent per gram than small fruits.&nbsp; Clusters provide the most product in small mushrooms per square foot of growing space.&nbsp; If you're going to clone, the last thing you want is to clone a large mushroom.&nbsp; Clone a young, rapidly growing mushroom from a cluster.&nbsp; This gives you the most product at the highest quality.<br />RR","title":"Re: My foaf's monotub: Great size but he still cant get the flushes
