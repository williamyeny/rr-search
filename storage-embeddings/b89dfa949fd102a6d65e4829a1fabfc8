As you're doing your first grain to grain transfer, start another culture from a master slant to a petri dish. By the time you reach 4 to 5 grain to grain transfers on the original culture, the new one will be ready for the first grain to grain transfer, ensuring you never run out.  \nThe above is how I keep supermarkets stocked with a constant supply of fresh product from our [mushroom farm](http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Mountain-Mushroom-Farm), all from a single master culture slant.
