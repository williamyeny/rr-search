{"key":"embedding-19602940","value":{"id":19602940,"content":"> Quote:  \n> **Violet said:**  \n> Bulk subs will have a lower BE number since the bulk adds weight without adding much yield power - that is where BE can be thought to fail to indicate success, as an A-tek grow and bulk substrate grow could have the same yield but the bulk substrate one will have a lower BE number. Having a lower BE in such a case doesn't make the bulk sub grow lesser, since it's almost just a circumstantial number. It's lower because a dry substrate material is used to apply necessary water.  \n> This is why I prefer to focus on the grains alone when calculating BE for grows like these. It makes the number applicable and meaningful at face value.\n  \nThis is flat-out wrong. First of all, wtf is A-tek? I've never heard of it. Teks should be named after what they do. We don't use 'A' for anything so don't need a tek for it.  \nSecondly, bulk substrates supply food for the mycelium. They are not used to 'apply water'. The casing layer you're putting over grains serves that purpose, but you're conveniently leaving that out of BE calculations, skewing the number in favor of straight grains.  \nThird, you're also wrong about bulk substrates always having a lower BE. I've seen straw deliver over 1000% BE, with 500% being average. On the cover of my DVD is a first flush of over 10 pounds of mushrooms from less than one pound of straw. That basket fruited again and again for several months.  \nTo claim in earlier posts that cased grains are higher potency than bulk substrates is over the top. The mycelium doesn't lose its vigor or potency when it's given a larger, more diverse substrate. If you doubt this, try to eat only one food item for a few months and see how you feel.  \nYou talked above about the energy costs to pasteurize bulk substrates. This cost pales in comparison to the cost of sterilizing grains at a much higher temperature, which is considerably more expensive and time consuming. If it was not, commercial farms would all be using cased grains, since these procedures have been around for decades.  \nThe bottom line is cased grains are fine and perform well. Bulk substrates are fine and perform well. BRF tek is fine and performs well. Each grower has a different set of conditions to deal with, so there are procedures to fit various circumstances. None are 'better' than any other. If I tried to run my shiitake farm on cased grains, I'd have gone bankrupt by now.
