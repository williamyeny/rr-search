Jars in an incubator are the same temperature inside as they are outside. (Especially a new grower who has half a dozen cakes in a cooler, which is who this discussion is typically about.)  \n> They have to be- think about it. Put a jar of myc in the fridge, it gets cold all the way through. It doesn't stay warm in the middle\n  \nThis is just getting ridiculous now. If you put a colonizing jar in the refrigerator, the metabolic activity slows down, thus heat is not being generated.  \nThe temperature inside a colonizing jar, whether inside or outside an 'incubator' is definitely going to be higher. Since glass is an insulator, shooting IR at the surface of the glass, which is exposed to the outside air is going to read less than a thermocouple inserted inside the jar. Thus, with a thermocouple, you'd see an even greater temp differential. This is not even something to argue about. It's been proved by everyone who's ever grown, and written about in mycology books for decades.  \nAs for my underground farm, the ground surrounding it pulls heat from the air within, helping to regulate temperature. If the farm was above ground and insulated properly, I wouldn't have to heat it, but cooling would be a bitch. Paul Stamets has a 10,000 square feet colonization room, which he doesn't heat in the winter. In fact, he pumps warm air from the colonization areas to other parts of his operation, thus saving energy.
