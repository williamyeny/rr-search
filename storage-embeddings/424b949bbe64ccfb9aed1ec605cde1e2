The calcium wouldn't lower pH.<br />As I understand it, gypsum is more of a nutritional supplement, than a soil conditioner, as it's presence promotes mycelial growth and is not added for pH adjustment.<br />Sulfur and Calcium are two things myc likes, but rye is poor in.<br />I could be wrong. </blockquote><br />Actually, that's right on.  Gypsum isn't used to adjust the pH.  A side benefit of gypsum is it tends to hold the pH stable, preventing a swing to acidic conditions caused by metabolism of the fungi.<br />Sulfur and calcium are both essential for good fruitbody formation, so gypsum helps to ensure that our substrates have plenty.  In addition, it's a soil conditioner that helps prevent clumping.  In some species, such as Shiitake, gypsum has shown a 20% increase in yields over the same subsrate without gypsum.<br />RR","title":"Re: Online Gypsum
