so you have to order several for when they crap out.&nbsp; When it's new, you'll have to re-calibrate once a week to keep accuracy.&nbsp; The reason is that as the hair or other fiber inside stretches, it loses calibration.&nbsp; Calibrate by wrapping up in a damp towel for an hour, and then adjust the screw on back so the dial reads 99%.<br />If you can find a US, Canadian, or European
