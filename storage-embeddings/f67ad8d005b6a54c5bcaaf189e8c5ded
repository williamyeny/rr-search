{"key":"embedding-19504862","value":{"id":19504862,"content":"> Quote:  \n> **StygianKnight said:**  \n> I want studies, science papers, not forum quotes.\n  \nThen get off your ass and do your own damn research.   \nThis board has amateur _and_ professional growers who come in here to help others and donate our time for no other reward than the love of mushrooms. If that isn't good enough, go elsewhere.  \nJust because some pimply faced school-kid hasn't learned what we have so he can write a 'paper' for his teacher, doesn't negate my decades of actual experience and a few million pounds of mushroom production. It also doesn't negate the experiences of thousands of growers who have followed the [lighting requirements of mushrooms](http://www.mushroomvideos.com/Terrarium-Tek#lighting) and reported substantially increased yields.  \nLight _is_ energy if you didn't know. If something uses energy and gets bigger, it's deriving energy. It's not a tough concept. Light is energy. Calories are a measure of energy. Give your mushrooms light and they get bigger and supply more calories when you eat them. Therefore light is being used as a direct source of energy. It's not a _reaction_, which is what happens when a leaf or mushroom cap physically turns to orient itself toward the light.
