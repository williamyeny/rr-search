For most of us, the payoff on buying a natural daylight fluorescent or LED lamp comes on the very first harvest.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **tugwax said:**  \n> Automatic moisture delivery or FAE for a small grow. I myself fell into this OTT solution for just 9 cakes. Even though it was successful I soon reverted to manual methods with greater yield. Now the timers, air pump and fogger are gathering dust, Â£70 wasted.\n  \nAgreed. Been saying it for years regarding terrariums. Save the humidifiers and timers for a mini-greenhouse.  \n\n> Quote:  \n> **tugwax said:**  \n> Trying to find hardwood chips when any old mixed stuff will do.   \n> Not so. While softwoods will colonize faster because they're less dense, fruiting performance is substantially reduced. Mixed woods are OK if the majority of material comes from hardwood sources, with just a few conifers tossed in. If you want to use Pine, chip it up and let it sit in the sun for a year before use. However, it will still underperform hardwood.  \n>
