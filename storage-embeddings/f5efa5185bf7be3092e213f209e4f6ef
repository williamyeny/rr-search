{"key":"embedding-15368607","value":{"id":15368607,"content":"> Quote:  \n> **vortex93 said:**  \n> Im pretty sure that doesnt work, if you innoc with two different \"strains\" one will outgrow the other.\n  \n> Quote:  \n> **dressel11 said:**  \n> Vortex is right the stronger strain beat out the weaker one. However the ones that fruited would not only have been competing with spores of substrains of its strain but also spores of a whole strain all together. That means they are probably pretty strong. If you isolated and cloned one of them it would probably fair quite well.\n  \nBoth of these comments are 100% incorrect.  \nIn addition, 'strains' of a commons species will easily 'mate' and do not meet the criteria for being called a hybrid.  \nIt makes no difference to to the species whether the spores came from mushroom caps from different regions.  \nTo say otherwise is as incorrect as saying that a white woman from Europe who mates with a black man from Africa will have the genes 'compete' with each other and the child will be either white or black, but not a combination of the two. It just simply doesn't work that way.
