Youtube is full of webcam and camcorder videos on mushroom growing that people can watch.&nbsp; Most of my sales are to edible growers, libraries and schools, and they won't purchase home made burned DVDs, nor will my national distributors accept them.&nbsp; The DVD is in stock at many Target stores, and if it's not in your area, the manager can order it for you.<br />I've tried to get it on netflix, but the deal fell through.&nbsp; I would only have received 1 penny per rental.&nbsp; I'm not going to supply them with product for that price.&nbsp; It would take a hundred years to break even.&nbsp; Perhaps the latest Hollywood movies can make it on a penny per rental, but they're talking about millions of rentals, not exactly the numbers a mushroom video would generate.<br />At any rate, I'll break even one day, especially as mushrooms move more mainstream.&nbsp; My intention was to make a good enough product that no one else would make a similar one, and to date nobody has.&nbsp; I'm not whining.&nbsp; I simply mentioned that I'm going to be writing books, possibly with an attached DVD from now on.&nbsp; The DVD will only give the hands on stuff, not the formulas, etc., so I wouldn't mind it getting put up on torrents, as it would be free advertising for the book.<br />It just hurts to see people willing to take away what we worked hard to make.&nbsp; Those people downloading torrents would probably be pissed off if they worked all week, and then on payday, somebody downloaded their paycheck before they could cash it to pay their bills.&nbsp; Such is what's happening to the mrs and I.<br />For those who have bought the DVD, thank you!&nbsp; It's for sale from several shroomery sponsors for ten dollars less than at amazon, which handles 90% of the mainstream sales.&nbsp; For those of you who can live with stealing from us, enjoy your illegal downloads.&nbsp; The Mrs has her house in the mountains, her first puppy, and will be planting a garden in the spring, so she's happy.<br />RR","title":"Re: Is RR coming out with a new
