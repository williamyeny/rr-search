{"key":"embedding-10742084","value":{"id":10742084,"content":"> Quote:  \n> But I don't understand the bitter hostility.\n  \nI just read this whole thread looking for that hostility and didn't find it. ![:shrug:](https://files.shroomery.org/smileys/shrug.gif \":shrug:\") Perhaps you could point me to it, and I'll do something. I've tried to advise based on what works fastest and with the least amount of contamination. The myceliated water from a jar of grains injected with sterile water is not really LC, since you're not growing the mycelium in liquid media. That's why I've always tried to call it _myceliated water_, since the water is simply the carrier.  \nI've used LC and have an eberbach, a magnetic stir plate(five or six of them) and a couple of laminar flow hoods. I _still_ find that grain to grain transfers are faster and have less chance of failure.  \nMy concern is new growers squirting spores into sugar water, and then a month later injecting that into their cakes and ruining them, thus they've lost two months and have nothing to show. They often quit at that time, as can be seen from the hundreds who register here every month, fail and then quit. Helping them achieve success on their first grow is what I'm trying to do here. Hopefully, that's not where you're perceiving the hostility.  \nAs for my underground mushroom cave, it's still under construction and not operational yet. Here's a pic from yesterday. I'm laying natural rock on the inside, and similar but larger rocks will cover the entrance, giving the look and ambiance of a real cave. The rocks you see will go all the way to the ceiling in a few places, and will also be laid down on the entire floor. I can only lay about 24\" in a day, and then have to let the mortar cure before adding more rocks, to avoid collapse. The rock has all been gathered either from my own property or adjoining land in the forest. I have 20 pickup loads stacked up outside so far.  \nRR
