Post a link to some evidence that this even remotely possible. Id love to read it!\n  \nBest cinch the foil down nice and tight because that's how it happens. Cows(not horses) eat the spore covered grass next to growing mushrooms and repeat the process. Many, many wild patches have been initiated by inserting spore prints into a cattle water trough. Don't deny or ridicule that which you don't understand.  \nThe same thing happens in the plant kingdom with many birds and mammals eating seeds and then depositing them in their dung elsewhere to sprout and grow.
