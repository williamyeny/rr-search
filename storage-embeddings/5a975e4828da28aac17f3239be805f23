That's why it's so prone to cobweb mold when used as a casing layer. In addition, vermiculite acts like a sponge, absorbing water and holding it for the mycelium to use as needed.&nbsp; Perlite is not capable of absorbing water because it's crystalline.<br />Threads like this&nbsp; get started several times a year.&nbsp; That's why I posted <a href=\"/forums/showflat.php/Number/6610766#Post6610766\" class=\"pp\" target=\"_blank\">this thread</a> last year, so people wouldn't repeat the same mistakes that have been made many times before, by trying to substitute one for the other.&nbsp; They're not compatable, and perlite isn't compatible with cakes, either as a contaminant barrier or moisture reservior.&nbsp; If you followed pf tek, but with perlite, I'm sure you noticed your substrate was way too wet.<br />RR","title":"Re: Perlite in PF
