(bring temp up slowly) - wait for rocker to start moving - once it starts to move bring flame down to simmer - PC for 90 minutes - After cool but still hot shake jars to break up clumps</blockquote><br />No.&nbsp; Leave the weight off until steam has escaped for at least a few minutes.&nbsp; You must get all the air out of the PC if it's going to work.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />*Inoculation - After jars have left to cool over night in PC Inject spore solution through polyphill with 1 1/4cc (more or less?)- Shake to distribute solution - Shake again when 10% colonized - Shake again at 50% colonized.</blockquote><br />Don't shake after inoculation.&nbsp; Wait until you see at least ten percent colonization.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />*Casing - After jars have colonized (75% or 100%?) spread 3/4\" (might cut it down to 1/2\") of perlite(or vermiculite)<br />along the bottom of terrarium - Mist slightly with water/H2O2 solution - Spread colonized WBS to make a 4\" layer - Cover up with 3/4\" of moist 50/50 (again might cut it down to 1/2\")</blockquote><br />Never use grains that are less than 100% colonized.&nbsp; 4\" is too thick for grains.&nbsp; Use 1 1/2 to 2 inches maximum.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />*Fruiting - After letting mycelium fully colonize casing introduce a couple hours of light to the terrarium every day to initiate pinning</blockquote><br />Never allow the mycelium to completely colonize the casing layer.&nbsp; Introduce fresh air exchange at 30% colonization or so.&nbsp; Don't keep in the dark at any time.&nbsp; Give ambient light from day one.&nbsp; Use a bright fluorescent lamp at fruiting time.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />*Harvest - As mushrooms begin to appear pick them just after the veil breaks to prevent overlay(I think) - If the casing layer becomes damaged to to harvest patch spots up with 50/50 mix.</blockquote><br />The casing layer won't get damaged if you'll slice off the mushrooms at the base with a sharp knife rather than ripping them out, which causes terrible damage.<br /><blockquote>Quote:<br />he things I did leave out was my terrarium design, nuking substrate to sterilize and things of that sorts</blockquote><br />Don't get anything associated with mushroom growing anywhere near a filthy microwave.&nbsp; Besides, they neither pasteurize nor sterilize.<br
