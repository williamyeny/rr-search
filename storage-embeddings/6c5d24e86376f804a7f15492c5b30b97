{"key":"embedding-5846366","value":{"id":5846366,"content":"For the record, **THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT POTENCY IS SUBSTRATE RELATED.** Sorry for the caps, but the disinformation in this thread makes me want to scream. What right do people who have only made a few grows have to make such a claim? Do you see any old timers spouting such nonesense?  \nSome strains turn out to be bunk. That is a fact. By 'strain', I mean the isolate that you end up with from multispore inoculation, not some particular vendor named strain. If a newbie grows on brf and gets a bunk strain, he tells everyone that brf is crap. If he grows again on horse manure and gets a good isolate, he tells everyone that horse manure rules. Get a grip people.  \nSize and substrate material will affect the total yield of your crop. Some very experienced growers around here use nothing but brf cakes for one reason. They work. Personally, I prefer horse manure, but it's not for the potency, but the yield and ease. If you use a substrate that provides basic food, your mycelium will do the rest. If I see another brf sucks thread, I think I'll puke.
